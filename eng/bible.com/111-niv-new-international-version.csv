GEN.1.1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
GEN.1.2	Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
GEN.1.3	And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
GEN.1.4	God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
GEN.1.6	And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” 
GEN.1.7	So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. 
GEN.1.8	God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
GEN.1.9	And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.10	God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.11	Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.12	The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.13	And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
GEN.1.14	And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 
GEN.1.15	and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.16	God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 
GEN.1.17	God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 
GEN.1.18	to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.19	And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
GEN.1.20	And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” 
GEN.1.21	So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.22	God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” 
GEN.1.23	And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.
GEN.1.24	And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.25	God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.26	Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,
GEN.1.27	So God created mankind in his own image,
GEN.1.27	in the image of God he created them;
GEN.1.27	male and female he created them.
GEN.1.28	God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”
GEN.1.29	Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 
GEN.1.30	And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.
GEN.1.31	God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
GEN.2.2	By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. 
GEN.2.3	Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.
GEN.2.4	This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the 
GEN.2.5	Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth
GEN.2.6	but streams
GEN.2.7	Then the 
GEN.2.8	Now the 
GEN.2.9	The 
GEN.2.10	A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. 
GEN.2.11	The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. 
GEN.2.12	(The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin
GEN.2.13	The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.
GEN.2.14	The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
GEN.2.15	The 
GEN.2.16	And the 
GEN.2.17	but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.”
GEN.2.18	The 
GEN.2.19	Now the 
GEN.2.20	So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.
GEN.2.20	But for Adam
GEN.2.21	So the 
GEN.2.22	Then the 
GEN.2.23	The man said,
GEN.2.23	“This is now bone of my bones
GEN.2.23	and flesh of my flesh;
GEN.2.23	she shall be called ‘woman,’
GEN.2.23	for she was taken out of man.”
GEN.2.24	That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.
GEN.2.25	Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
GEN.3.1	Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the 
GEN.3.2	The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, 
GEN.3.3	but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’ ”
GEN.3.4	“You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. 
GEN.3.5	“For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
GEN.3.6	When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 
GEN.3.7	Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
GEN.3.8	Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the 
GEN.3.9	But the 
GEN.3.10	He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.”
GEN.3.11	And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
GEN.3.12	The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
GEN.3.13	Then the 
GEN.3.13	The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
GEN.3.14	So the 
GEN.3.14	“Cursed are you above all livestock
GEN.3.14	and all wild animals!
GEN.3.14	You will crawl on your belly
GEN.3.14	and you will eat dust
GEN.3.14	all the days of your life.
GEN.3.15	And I will put enmity
GEN.3.15	between you and the woman,
GEN.3.15	and between your offspring
GEN.3.15	he will crush
GEN.3.15	and you will strike his heel.”
GEN.3.16	To the woman he said,
GEN.3.16	“I will make your pains in childbearing very severe;
GEN.3.16	with painful labor you will give birth to children.
GEN.3.16	Your desire will be for your husband,
GEN.3.16	and he will rule over you.”
GEN.3.17	To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’
GEN.3.17	“Cursed is the ground because of you;
GEN.3.17	through painful toil you will eat food from it
GEN.3.17	all the days of your life.
GEN.3.18	It will produce thorns and thistles for you,
GEN.3.18	and you will eat the plants of the field.
GEN.3.19	By the sweat of your brow
GEN.3.19	you will eat your food
GEN.3.19	until you return to the ground,
GEN.3.19	since from it you were taken;
GEN.3.19	for dust you are
GEN.3.19	and to dust you will return.”
GEN.3.20	Adam
GEN.3.21	The 
GEN.3.22	And the 
GEN.3.23	So the 
GEN.3.24	After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side
GEN.4.1	Adam
GEN.4.2	Later she gave birth to his brother Abel.
GEN.4.2	Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. 
GEN.4.3	In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the 
GEN.4.4	And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The 
GEN.4.5	but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.
GEN.4.6	Then the 
GEN.4.7	If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.”
GEN.4.8	Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.”
GEN.4.9	Then the 
GEN.4.9	“I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
GEN.4.10	The 
GEN.4.11	Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 
GEN.4.12	When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”
GEN.4.13	Cain said to the 
GEN.4.14	Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”
GEN.4.15	But the 
GEN.4.16	So Cain went out from the 
GEN.4.17	Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 
GEN.4.18	To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.
GEN.4.19	Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. 
GEN.4.21	His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. 
GEN.4.22	Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of
GEN.4.23	Lamech said to his wives,
GEN.4.23	“Adah and Zillah, listen to me;
GEN.4.23	wives of Lamech, hear my words.
GEN.4.23	I have killed a man for wounding me,
GEN.4.23	a young man for injuring me.
GEN.4.24	If Cain is avenged seven times,
GEN.4.24	then Lamech seventy-seven times.”
GEN.4.25	Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth,
GEN.4.26	Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh.
GEN.4.26	At that time people began to call on
GEN.5.1	This is the written account of Adam’s family line.
GEN.5.1	When God created mankind, he made them in the likeness of God. 
GEN.5.2	He created them male and female and blessed them. And he named them “Mankind”
GEN.5.3	When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth. 
GEN.5.4	After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.5	Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.6	When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father
GEN.5.7	After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.8	Altogether, Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.9	When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan. 
GEN.5.10	After he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.11	Altogether, Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.12	When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel. 
GEN.5.13	After he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.14	Altogether, Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.15	When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared. 
GEN.5.16	After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.17	Altogether, Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.18	When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch. 
GEN.5.19	After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.20	Altogether, Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.21	When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.23	Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years. 
GEN.5.24	Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.
GEN.5.25	When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	After he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.27	Altogether, Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.28	When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son. 
GEN.5.29	He named him Noah
GEN.5.30	After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.31	Altogether, Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.32	After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, 
GEN.6.2	the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. 
GEN.6.3	Then the 
GEN.6.4	The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.
GEN.6.5	The 
GEN.6.6	The 
GEN.6.7	So the 
GEN.6.8	But Noah found favor in the eyes of the 
GEN.6.9	This is the account of Noah and his family.
GEN.6.9	Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God. 
GEN.6.10	Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence. 
GEN.6.12	God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. 
GEN.6.13	So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. 
GEN.6.14	So make yourself an ark of cypress
GEN.6.15	This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.
GEN.6.16	Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit
GEN.6.17	I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. 
GEN.6.18	But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. 
GEN.6.19	You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. 
GEN.6.20	Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. 
GEN.6.21	You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.”
GEN.6.22	Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
GEN.7.1	The 
GEN.7.2	Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, 
GEN.7.3	and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth. 
GEN.7.4	Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.”
GEN.7.5	And Noah did all that the 
GEN.7.6	Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth. 
GEN.7.7	And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. 
GEN.7.8	Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground, 
GEN.7.9	male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. 
GEN.7.12	And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
GEN.7.13	On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark. 
GEN.7.14	They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings. 
GEN.7.15	Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark. 
GEN.7.16	The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the 
GEN.7.17	For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth. 
GEN.7.18	The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. 
GEN.7.19	They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered. 
GEN.7.20	The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.
GEN.7.21	Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. 
GEN.7.22	Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. 
GEN.7.23	Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.
GEN.7.24	The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
GEN.8.1	But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded. 
GEN.8.2	Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky. 
GEN.8.3	The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down, 
GEN.8.4	and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. 
GEN.8.5	The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.
GEN.8.6	After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark 
GEN.8.7	and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth. 
GEN.8.8	Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground. 
GEN.8.9	But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark. 
GEN.8.10	He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. 
GEN.8.11	When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth. 
GEN.8.12	He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.
GEN.8.13	By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry. 
GEN.8.14	By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.
GEN.8.15	Then God said to Noah, 
GEN.8.16	“Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives. 
GEN.8.17	Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.”
GEN.8.18	So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives. 
GEN.8.19	All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds—everything that moves on land—came out of the ark, one kind after another.
GEN.8.20	Then Noah built an altar to the 
GEN.8.21	The 
GEN.8.22	“As long as the earth endures,
GEN.8.22	seedtime and harvest,
GEN.8.22	cold and heat,
GEN.8.22	summer and winter,
GEN.8.22	day and night
GEN.8.22	will never cease.”
GEN.9.1	Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. 
GEN.9.2	The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands. 
GEN.9.3	Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.
GEN.9.4	“But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it. 
GEN.9.5	And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being.
GEN.9.6	“Whoever sheds human blood,
GEN.9.6	by humans shall their blood be shed;
GEN.9.6	for in the image of God
GEN.9.6	has God made mankind.
GEN.9.7	As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.”
GEN.9.8	Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: 
GEN.9.9	“I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you 
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth. 
GEN.9.11	I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”
GEN.9.12	And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: 
GEN.9.13	I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 
GEN.9.14	Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, 
GEN.9.15	I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. 
GEN.9.16	Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.”
GEN.9.17	So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.”
GEN.9.18	The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.) 
GEN.9.19	These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth.
GEN.9.20	Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded
GEN.9.21	When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent. 
GEN.9.22	Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside. 
GEN.9.23	But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father’s naked body. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father naked.
GEN.9.24	When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him, 
GEN.9.25	he said,
GEN.9.25	“Cursed be Canaan!
GEN.9.25	The lowest of slaves
GEN.9.25	will he be to his brothers.”
GEN.9.26	He also said,
GEN.9.26	“Praise be to the 
GEN.9.26	May Canaan be the slave of Shem.
GEN.9.27	May God extend Japheth’s
GEN.9.27	may Japheth live in the tents of Shem,
GEN.9.27	and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth.”
GEN.9.28	After the flood Noah lived 350 years. 
GEN.9.29	Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died.
GEN.10.1	This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah’s sons, who themselves had sons after the flood.
GEN.10.2	The sons
GEN.10.2	Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshek and Tiras.
GEN.10.3	The sons of Gomer:
GEN.10.3	Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah.
GEN.10.4	The sons of Javan:
GEN.10.4	Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites and the Rodanites.
GEN.10.5	(From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.)
GEN.10.6	The sons of Ham:
GEN.10.6	Cush, Egypt, Put and Canaan.
GEN.10.7	The sons of Cush:
GEN.10.7	Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteka.
GEN.10.7	The sons of Raamah:
GEN.10.7	Sheba and Dedan.
GEN.10.8	Cush was the father
GEN.10.9	He was a mighty hunter before the 
GEN.10.10	The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in
GEN.10.11	From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir,
GEN.10.12	and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city.
GEN.10.13	Egypt was the father of
GEN.10.13	the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites, 
GEN.10.14	Pathrusites, Kasluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites.
GEN.10.15	Canaan was the father of
GEN.10.15	Sidon his firstborn,
GEN.10.16	Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, 
GEN.10.17	Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, 
GEN.10.18	Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites.
GEN.10.18	Later the Canaanite clans scattered 
GEN.10.19	and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, as far as Lasha.
GEN.10.20	These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
GEN.10.21	Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was
GEN.10.22	The sons of Shem:
GEN.10.22	Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.
GEN.10.23	The sons of Aram:
GEN.10.23	Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshek.
GEN.10.24	Arphaxad was the father of
GEN.10.24	and Shelah the father of Eber.
GEN.10.25	Two sons were born to Eber:
GEN.10.25	One was named Peleg,
GEN.10.26	Joktan was the father of
GEN.10.26	Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.
GEN.10.30	The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.
GEN.10.31	These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
GEN.10.32	These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
GEN.11.1	Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. 
GEN.11.2	As people moved eastward,
GEN.11.3	They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. 
GEN.11.4	Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”
GEN.11.5	But the 
GEN.11.6	The 
GEN.11.7	Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”
GEN.11.8	So the 
GEN.11.9	That is why it was called Babel
GEN.11.10	This is the account of Shem’s family line.
GEN.11.10	Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father
GEN.11.11	And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.12	When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah. 
GEN.11.13	And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.14	When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber. 
GEN.11.15	And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.16	When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg. 
GEN.11.17	And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.18	When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu. 
GEN.11.19	And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug. 
GEN.11.21	And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor. 
GEN.11.23	And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.24	When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah. 
GEN.11.25	And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
GEN.11.27	This is the account of Terah’s family line.
GEN.11.27	Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot. 
GEN.11.28	While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth. 
GEN.11.29	Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milkah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milkah and Iskah. 
GEN.11.30	Now Sarai was childless because she was not able to conceive.
GEN.11.31	Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Harran, they settled there.
GEN.11.32	Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Harran.
GEN.12.1	The 
GEN.12.2	“I will make you into a great nation,
GEN.12.2	and I will bless you;
GEN.12.2	I will make your name great,
GEN.12.2	and you will be a blessing.
GEN.12.3	I will bless those who bless you,
GEN.12.3	and whoever curses you I will curse;
GEN.12.3	and all peoples on earth
GEN.12.3	will be blessed through you.”
GEN.12.4	So Abram went, as the 
GEN.12.5	He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Harran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there.
GEN.12.6	Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. 
GEN.12.7	The 
GEN.12.8	From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the 
GEN.12.9	Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.
GEN.12.10	Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe. 
GEN.12.11	As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know what a beautiful woman you are. 
GEN.12.12	When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will let you live. 
GEN.12.13	Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.”
GEN.12.14	When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman. 
GEN.12.15	And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace. 
GEN.12.16	He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.
GEN.12.17	But the 
GEN.12.18	So Pharaoh summoned Abram. “What have you done to me?” he said. “Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!” 
GEN.12.20	Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.
GEN.13.1	So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him. 
GEN.13.2	Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.
GEN.13.3	From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier 
GEN.13.4	and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the 
GEN.13.5	Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 
GEN.13.6	But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together. 
GEN.13.7	And quarreling arose between Abram’s herders and Lot’s. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.
GEN.13.8	So Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives. 
GEN.13.9	Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.”
GEN.13.10	Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the 
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company: 
GEN.13.12	Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom. 
GEN.13.13	Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the 
GEN.13.14	The 
GEN.13.15	All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring
GEN.13.16	I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted. 
GEN.13.17	Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.”
GEN.13.18	So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the 
GEN.14.1	At the time when Amraphel was king of Shinar,
GEN.14.2	these kings went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 
GEN.14.3	All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea Valley). 
GEN.14.4	For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
GEN.14.5	In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert. 
GEN.14.7	Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar.
GEN.14.8	Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboyim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim 
GEN.14.9	against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five. 
GEN.14.10	Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills. 
GEN.14.11	The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away. 
GEN.14.12	They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom.
GEN.14.13	A man who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother
GEN.14.14	When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 
GEN.14.15	During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people.
GEN.14.17	After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).
GEN.14.18	Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, 
GEN.14.19	and he blessed Abram, saying,
GEN.14.19	“Blessed be Abram by God Most High,
GEN.14.19	Creator of heaven and earth.
GEN.14.20	And praise be to God Most High,
GEN.14.20	who delivered your enemies into your hand.”
GEN.14.20	Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
GEN.14.21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.”
GEN.14.22	But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “With raised hand I have sworn an oath to the 
GEN.14.23	that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ 
GEN.14.24	I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—to Aner, Eshkol and Mamre. Let them have their share.”
GEN.15.1	After this, the word of the 
GEN.15.1	“Do not be afraid, Abram.
GEN.15.1	I am your shield,
GEN.15.1	your very great reward.
GEN.15.2	But Abram said, “Sovereign 
GEN.15.3	And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.”
GEN.15.4	Then the word of the 
GEN.15.5	He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring
GEN.15.6	Abram believed the 
GEN.15.7	He also said to him, “I am the 
GEN.15.8	But Abram said, “Sovereign 
GEN.15.9	So the 
GEN.15.10	Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. 
GEN.15.11	Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. 
GEN.15.13	Then the 
GEN.15.14	But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. 
GEN.15.15	You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. 
GEN.15.16	In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”
GEN.15.17	When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. 
GEN.15.18	On that day the 
GEN.15.19	the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, 
GEN.15.21	Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar; 
GEN.16.2	so she said to Abram, “The 
GEN.16.2	Abram agreed to what Sarai said. 
GEN.16.3	So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife. 
GEN.16.4	He slept with Hagar, and she conceived.
GEN.16.4	When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. 
GEN.16.5	Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the 
GEN.16.6	“Your slave is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.
GEN.16.7	The angel of the 
GEN.16.8	And he said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?”
GEN.16.8	“I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered.
GEN.16.9	Then the angel of the 
GEN.16.10	The angel added, “I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.”
GEN.16.11	The angel of the 
GEN.16.11	“You are now pregnant
GEN.16.11	and you will give birth to a son.
GEN.16.11	You shall name him Ishmael,
GEN.16.11	for the 
GEN.16.12	He will be a wild donkey of a man;
GEN.16.12	his hand will be against everyone
GEN.16.12	and everyone’s hand against him,
GEN.16.12	and he will live in hostility
GEN.16.12	toward
GEN.16.13	She gave this name to the 
GEN.16.14	That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi
GEN.16.15	So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne. 
GEN.16.16	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
GEN.17.1	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the 
GEN.17.2	Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.”
GEN.17.3	Abram fell facedown, and God said to him, 
GEN.17.4	“As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations. 
GEN.17.5	No longer will you be called Abram
GEN.17.6	I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you. 
GEN.17.7	I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. 
GEN.17.8	The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.”
GEN.17.9	Then God said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come. 
GEN.17.10	This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised. 
GEN.17.11	You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. 
GEN.17.12	For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring. 
GEN.17.13	Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant. 
GEN.17.14	Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”
GEN.17.15	God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah. 
GEN.17.16	I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”
GEN.17.17	Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?” 
GEN.17.18	And Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!”
GEN.17.19	Then God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac.
GEN.17.20	And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.” 
GEN.17.22	When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
GEN.17.23	On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him. 
GEN.17.24	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised, 
GEN.17.25	and his son Ishmael was thirteen; 
GEN.17.26	Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that very day. 
GEN.17.27	And every male in Abraham’s household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	The 
GEN.18.2	Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.
GEN.18.3	He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord,
GEN.18.4	Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. 
GEN.18.5	Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.”
GEN.18.5	“Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.”
GEN.18.6	So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs
GEN.18.7	Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. 
GEN.18.8	He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.
GEN.18.9	“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him.
GEN.18.9	“There, in the tent,” he said.
GEN.18.10	Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.”
GEN.18.10	Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him. 
GEN.18.11	Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. 
GEN.18.12	So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?”
GEN.18.13	Then the 
GEN.18.14	Is anything too hard for the 
GEN.18.15	Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.”
GEN.18.15	But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”
GEN.18.16	When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. 
GEN.18.17	Then the 
GEN.18.18	Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.
GEN.18.19	For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the 
GEN.18.20	Then the 
GEN.18.21	that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.”
GEN.18.22	The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the 
GEN.18.23	Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 
GEN.18.24	What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare
GEN.18.25	Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?”
GEN.18.26	The 
GEN.18.27	Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, 
GEN.18.28	what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?”
GEN.18.28	“If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.”
GEN.18.29	Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?”
GEN.18.29	He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”
GEN.18.30	Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?”
GEN.18.30	He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”
GEN.18.31	Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?”
GEN.18.31	He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”
GEN.18.32	Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?”
GEN.18.32	He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”
GEN.18.33	When the 
GEN.19.1	The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. 
GEN.19.2	“My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.”
GEN.19.2	“No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”
GEN.19.3	But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. 
GEN.19.4	Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. 
GEN.19.5	They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”
GEN.19.6	Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him 
GEN.19.7	and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing. 
GEN.19.8	Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”
GEN.19.9	“Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.
GEN.19.10	But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. 
GEN.19.11	Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.
GEN.19.12	The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, 
GEN.19.13	because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the 
GEN.19.14	So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry
GEN.19.15	With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.”
GEN.19.16	When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the 
GEN.19.17	As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!”
GEN.19.18	But Lot said to them, “No, my lords,
GEN.19.19	Your
GEN.19.20	Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.”
GEN.19.21	He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. 
GEN.19.22	But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar.
GEN.19.23	By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. 
GEN.19.24	Then the 
GEN.19.25	Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land. 
GEN.19.26	But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
GEN.19.27	Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the 
GEN.19.28	He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
GEN.19.29	So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
GEN.19.30	Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. 
GEN.19.31	One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth. 
GEN.19.32	Let’s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.”
GEN.19.33	That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
GEN.19.34	The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I slept with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.” 
GEN.19.35	So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
GEN.19.36	So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. 
GEN.19.37	The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab
GEN.19.38	The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi
GEN.20.1	Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar, 
GEN.20.2	and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” Then Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”
GEN.20.4	Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? 
GEN.20.5	Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and didn’t she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.”
GEN.20.6	Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her. 
GEN.20.7	Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.”
GEN.20.8	Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.” 
GEN.20.10	And Abimelek asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?”
GEN.20.11	Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ 
GEN.20.12	Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. 
GEN.20.13	And when God had me wander from my father’s household, I said to her, ‘This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ”
GEN.20.14	Then Abimelek brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him. 
GEN.20.15	And Abimelek said, “My land is before you; live wherever you like.”
GEN.20.16	To Sarah he said, “I am giving your brother a thousand shekels
GEN.20.17	Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again, 
GEN.20.18	for the 
GEN.21.1	Now the 
GEN.21.2	Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. 
GEN.21.3	Abraham gave the name Isaac
GEN.21.4	When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him. 
GEN.21.5	Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
GEN.21.6	Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.” 
GEN.21.7	And she added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
GEN.21.8	The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast. 
GEN.21.9	But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking, 
GEN.21.10	and she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.”
GEN.21.11	The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son. 
GEN.21.12	But God said to him, “Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring
GEN.21.13	I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring.”
GEN.21.14	Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba.
GEN.21.15	When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes. 
GEN.21.16	Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And as she sat there, she
GEN.21.17	God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. 
GEN.21.18	Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”
GEN.21.19	Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
GEN.21.20	God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer. 
GEN.21.21	While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.
GEN.21.22	At that time Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do. 
GEN.21.23	Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you.”
GEN.21.24	Abraham said, “I swear it.”
GEN.21.25	Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek’s servants had seized. 
GEN.21.26	But Abimelek said, “I don’t know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.”
GEN.21.27	So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty. 
GEN.21.28	Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock, 
GEN.21.29	and Abimelek asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?”
GEN.21.30	He replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.”
GEN.21.31	So that place was called Beersheba,
GEN.21.32	After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the 
GEN.21.34	And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
GEN.22.1	Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!”
GEN.22.1	“Here I am,” he replied.
GEN.22.2	Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”
GEN.22.3	Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. 
GEN.22.5	He said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.”
GEN.22.6	Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, 
GEN.22.7	Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, “Father?”
GEN.22.7	“Yes, my son?” Abraham replied.
GEN.22.7	“The fire and wood are here,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
GEN.22.8	Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went on together.
GEN.22.9	When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 
GEN.22.10	Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 
GEN.22.11	But the angel of the 
GEN.22.11	“Here I am,” he replied.
GEN.22.12	“Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.”
GEN.22.13	Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram
GEN.22.14	So Abraham called that place The 
GEN.22.15	The angel of the 
GEN.22.16	and said, “I swear by myself, declares the 
GEN.22.17	I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies, 
GEN.22.18	and through your offspring
GEN.22.19	Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.
GEN.22.20	Some time later Abraham was told, “Milkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor: 
GEN.22.21	Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram), 
GEN.22.22	Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milkah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor. 
GEN.22.24	His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maakah.
GEN.23.1	Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old. 
GEN.23.2	She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.
GEN.23.3	Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites.
GEN.23.4	“I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.”
GEN.23.5	The Hittites replied to Abraham, 
GEN.23.6	“Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.”
GEN.23.7	Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites. 
GEN.23.8	He said to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf 
GEN.23.9	so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.”
GEN.23.10	Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. 
GEN.23.11	“No, my lord,” he said. “Listen to me; I give
GEN.23.12	Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land 
GEN.23.13	and he said to Ephron in their hearing, “Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.”
GEN.23.14	Ephron answered Abraham, 
GEN.23.15	“Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels
GEN.23.16	Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.
GEN.23.17	So Ephron’s field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded 
GEN.23.18	to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city. 
GEN.23.19	Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.20	So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.
GEN.24.1	Abraham was now very old, and the 
GEN.24.2	He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh. 
GEN.24.3	I want you to swear by the 
GEN.24.4	but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.”
GEN.24.5	The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?”
GEN.24.6	“Make sure that you do not take my son back there,” Abraham said. 
GEN.24.7	“The 
GEN.24.8	If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.” 
GEN.24.9	So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
GEN.24.10	Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master’s camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim
GEN.24.11	He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.
GEN.24.12	Then he prayed, “
GEN.24.13	See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. 
GEN.24.14	May it be that when I say to a young woman, ‘Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too’—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”
GEN.24.15	Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor. 
GEN.24.16	The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.
GEN.24.17	The servant hurried to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.”
GEN.24.18	“Drink, my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
GEN.24.19	After she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink.” 
GEN.24.20	So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. 
GEN.24.21	Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the 
GEN.24.22	When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka
GEN.24.23	Then he asked, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”
GEN.24.24	She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor.” 
GEN.24.25	And she added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.”
GEN.24.26	Then the man bowed down and worshiped the 
GEN.24.27	saying, “Praise be to the 
GEN.24.28	The young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things. 
GEN.24.29	Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring. 
GEN.24.30	As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring. 
GEN.24.31	“Come, you who are blessed by the 
GEN.24.32	So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet. 
GEN.24.33	Then food was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.”
GEN.24.33	“Then tell us,” Laban said.
GEN.24.34	So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant. 
GEN.24.35	The 
GEN.24.36	My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns. 
GEN.24.37	And my master made me swear an oath, and said, ‘You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, 
GEN.24.38	but go to my father’s family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.’
GEN.24.39	“Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’
GEN.24.40	“He replied, ‘The 
GEN.24.41	You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you—then you will be released from my oath.’
GEN.24.42	“When I came to the spring today, I said, ‘
GEN.24.43	See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,” 
GEN.24.44	and if she says to me, “Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too,” let her be the one the 
GEN.24.45	“Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’
GEN.24.46	“She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too.’ So I drank, and she watered the camels also.
GEN.24.47	“I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’
GEN.24.47	“She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.’
GEN.24.47	“Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms, 
GEN.24.48	and I bowed down and worshiped the 
GEN.24.49	Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.”
GEN.24.50	Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the 
GEN.24.51	Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, as the 
GEN.24.52	When Abraham’s servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the 
GEN.24.53	Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother. 
GEN.24.54	Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there.
GEN.24.54	When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.”
GEN.24.55	But her brother and her mother replied, “Let the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you
GEN.24.56	But he said to them, “Do not detain me, now that the 
GEN.24.57	Then they said, “Let’s call the young woman and ask her about it.” 
GEN.24.58	So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?”
GEN.24.58	“I will go,” she said.
GEN.24.59	So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men. 
GEN.24.60	And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,
GEN.24.60	“Our sister, may you increase
GEN.24.60	to thousands upon thousands;
GEN.24.60	may your offspring possess
GEN.24.60	the cities of their enemies.”
GEN.24.61	Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
GEN.24.62	Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev. 
GEN.24.63	He went out to the field one evening to meditate,
GEN.24.64	Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel 
GEN.24.65	and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?”
GEN.24.65	“He is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.
GEN.24.66	Then the servant told Isaac all he had done. 
GEN.24.67	Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
GEN.25.1	Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Ashurites, the Letushites and the Leummites. 
GEN.25.4	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanok, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.
GEN.25.5	Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac. 
GEN.25.6	But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.
GEN.25.7	Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years. 
GEN.25.8	Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people. 
GEN.25.9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, 
GEN.25.10	the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites.
GEN.25.11	After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi.
GEN.25.12	This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Sarah’s slave, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.
GEN.25.13	These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps. 
GEN.25.17	Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people. 
GEN.25.18	His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt, as you go toward Ashur. And they lived in hostility toward
GEN.25.19	This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Isaac.
GEN.25.19	Abraham became the father of Isaac, 
GEN.25.20	and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram
GEN.25.21	Isaac prayed to the 
GEN.25.22	The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of the 
GEN.25.23	The 
GEN.25.23	“Two nations are in your womb,
GEN.25.23	and two peoples from within you will be separated;
GEN.25.23	one people will be stronger than the other,
GEN.25.23	and the older will serve the younger.”
GEN.25.24	When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. 
GEN.25.25	The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.
GEN.25.26	After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob.
GEN.25.27	The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents. 
GEN.25.28	Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
GEN.25.29	Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished. 
GEN.25.30	He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I’m famished!” (That is why he was also called Edom.
GEN.25.31	Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”
GEN.25.32	“Look, I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to me?”
GEN.25.33	But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left.
GEN.25.34	So Esau despised his birthright.
GEN.26.1	Now there was a famine in the land—besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time—and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines in Gerar. 
GEN.26.2	The 
GEN.26.3	Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham. 
GEN.26.4	I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring
GEN.26.5	because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions.” 
GEN.26.6	So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
GEN.26.7	When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful.”
GEN.26.8	When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. 
GEN.26.9	So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?”
GEN.26.9	Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.”
GEN.26.10	Then Abimelek said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”
GEN.26.11	So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”
GEN.26.12	Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the 
GEN.26.13	The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy. 
GEN.26.14	He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. 
GEN.26.15	So all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth.
GEN.26.16	Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us.”
GEN.26.17	So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled. 
GEN.26.18	Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.
GEN.26.19	Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there. 
GEN.26.20	But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek,
GEN.26.21	Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.
GEN.26.22	He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth,
GEN.26.23	From there he went up to Beersheba. 
GEN.26.24	That night the 
GEN.26.25	Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the 
GEN.26.26	Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces. 
GEN.26.27	Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?”
GEN.26.28	They answered, “We saw clearly that the 
GEN.26.29	that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the 
GEN.26.30	Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully.
GEN.26.32	That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, “We’ve found water!” 
GEN.26.33	He called it Shibah,
GEN.26.34	When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
GEN.26.35	They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
GEN.27.1	When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.”
GEN.27.1	“Here I am,” he answered.
GEN.27.2	Isaac said, “I am now an old man and don’t know the day of my death. 
GEN.27.3	Now then, get your equipment—your quiver and bow—and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me. 
GEN.27.4	Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.”
GEN.27.5	Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back, 
GEN.27.6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the 
GEN.27.8	Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you: 
GEN.27.9	Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it. 
GEN.27.10	Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.”
GEN.27.11	Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin. 
GEN.27.12	What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.”
GEN.27.13	His mother said to him, “My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.”
GEN.27.14	So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it. 
GEN.27.15	Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. 
GEN.27.16	She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins. 
GEN.27.17	Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.
GEN.27.18	He went to his father and said, “My father.”
GEN.27.18	“Yes, my son,” he answered. “Who is it?”
GEN.27.19	Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.”
GEN.27.20	Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?”
GEN.27.20	“The 
GEN.27.21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.”
GEN.27.22	Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 
GEN.27.23	He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him. 
GEN.27.24	“Are you really my son Esau?” he asked.
GEN.27.24	“I am,” he replied.
GEN.27.25	Then he said, “My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.”
GEN.27.25	Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank. 
GEN.27.26	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here, my son, and kiss me.”
GEN.27.27	So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said,
GEN.27.27	“Ah, the smell of my son
GEN.27.27	is like the smell of a field
GEN.27.27	that the 
GEN.27.28	May God give you heaven’s dew
GEN.27.28	and earth’s richness—
GEN.27.28	an abundance of grain and new wine.
GEN.27.29	May nations serve you
GEN.27.29	and peoples bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	Be lord over your brothers,
GEN.27.29	and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	May those who curse you be cursed
GEN.27.29	and those who bless you be blessed.”
GEN.27.30	After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting. 
GEN.27.31	He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, “My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.”
GEN.27.32	His father Isaac asked him, “Who are you?”
GEN.27.32	“I am your son,” he answered, “your firstborn, Esau.”
GEN.27.33	Isaac trembled violently and said, “Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!”
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me—me too, my father!”
GEN.27.35	But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.”
GEN.27.36	Esau said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob
GEN.27.37	Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?”
GEN.27.38	Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” Then Esau wept aloud.
GEN.27.39	His father Isaac answered him,
GEN.27.39	“Your dwelling will be
GEN.27.39	away from the earth’s richness,
GEN.27.39	away from the dew of heaven above.
GEN.27.40	You will live by the sword
GEN.27.40	and you will serve your brother.
GEN.27.40	But when you grow restless,
GEN.27.40	you will throw his yoke
GEN.27.40	from off your neck.”
GEN.27.41	Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
GEN.27.42	When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you. 
GEN.27.43	Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran. 
GEN.27.44	Stay with him for a while until your brother’s fury subsides. 
GEN.27.45	When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I’ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”
GEN.27.46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.”
GEN.28.1	So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him: “Do not marry a Canaanite woman. 
GEN.28.2	Go at once to Paddan Aram,
GEN.28.3	May God Almighty
GEN.28.4	May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.” 
GEN.28.5	Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
GEN.28.6	Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,” 
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram. 
GEN.28.8	Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac; 
GEN.28.9	so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had.
GEN.28.10	Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran. 
GEN.28.11	When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. 
GEN.28.12	He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. 
GEN.28.13	There above it
GEN.28.14	Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.
GEN.28.15	I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”
GEN.28.16	When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, “Surely the 
GEN.28.17	He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.”
GEN.28.18	Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. 
GEN.28.19	He called that place Bethel,
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear 
GEN.28.21	so that I return safely to my father’s household, then the 
GEN.28.22	and
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples. 
GEN.29.2	There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large. 
GEN.29.3	When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well’s mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.
GEN.29.4	Jacob asked the shepherds, “My brothers, where are you from?”
GEN.29.4	“We’re from Harran,” they replied.
GEN.29.5	He said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?”
GEN.29.5	“Yes, we know him,” they answered.
GEN.29.6	Then Jacob asked them, “Is he well?”
GEN.29.6	“Yes, he is,” they said, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”
GEN.29.7	“Look,” he said, “the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”
GEN.29.8	“We can’t,” they replied, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”
GEN.29.9	While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherd. 
GEN.29.10	When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban’s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep. 
GEN.29.11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud. 
GEN.29.12	He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.
GEN.29.13	As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things. 
GEN.29.14	Then Laban said to him, “You are my own flesh and blood.”
GEN.29.14	After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month, 
GEN.29.15	Laban said to him, “Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”
GEN.29.16	Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	Leah had weak
GEN.29.18	Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, “I’ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.”
GEN.29.19	Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.” 
GEN.29.20	So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.
GEN.29.21	Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her.”
GEN.29.22	So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast. 
GEN.29.23	But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her. 
GEN.29.24	And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant.
GEN.29.25	When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn’t I? Why have you deceived me?”
GEN.29.26	Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one. 
GEN.29.27	Finish this daughter’s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.”
GEN.29.28	And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. 
GEN.29.29	Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant. 
GEN.29.30	Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.
GEN.29.31	When the 
GEN.29.32	Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben,
GEN.29.33	She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Because the 
GEN.29.34	Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi.
GEN.29.35	She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “This time I will praise the 
GEN.30.1	When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I’ll die!”
GEN.30.2	Jacob became angry with her and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?”
GEN.30.3	Then she said, “Here is Bilhah, my servant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her.”
GEN.30.4	So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her, 
GEN.30.5	and she became pregnant and bore him a son. 
GEN.30.6	Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son.” Because of this she named him Dan.
GEN.30.7	Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	Then Rachel said, “I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won.” So she named him Naphtali.
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
GEN.30.10	Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.11	Then Leah said, “What good fortune!”
GEN.30.12	Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.13	Then Leah said, “How happy I am! The women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher.
GEN.30.14	During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.15	But she said to her, “Wasn’t it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son’s mandrakes too?”
GEN.30.15	“Very well,” Rachel said, “he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.16	So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. “You must sleep with me,” she said. “I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night.
GEN.30.17	God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
GEN.30.18	Then Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar.
GEN.30.19	Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son. 
GEN.30.20	Then Leah said, “God has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun.
GEN.30.21	Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and enabled her to conceive. 
GEN.30.23	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.” 
GEN.30.24	She named him Joseph,
GEN.30.25	After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I’ve done for you.”
GEN.30.27	But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the 
GEN.30.28	He added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.”
GEN.30.29	Jacob said to him, “You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care. 
GEN.30.30	The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the 
GEN.30.31	“What shall I give you?” he asked.
GEN.30.31	“Don’t give me anything,” Jacob replied. “But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them: 
GEN.30.32	Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages. 
GEN.30.33	And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.”
GEN.30.34	“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.” 
GEN.30.35	That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons. 
GEN.30.36	Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks.
GEN.30.37	Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches. 
GEN.30.38	Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink, 
GEN.30.39	they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted. 
GEN.30.40	Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban’s animals. 
GEN.30.41	Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches, 
GEN.30.42	but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob. 
GEN.30.43	In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
GEN.31.1	Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.” 
GEN.31.2	And Jacob noticed that Laban’s attitude toward him was not what it had been.
GEN.31.3	Then the 
GEN.31.4	So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were. 
GEN.31.5	He said to them, “I see that your father’s attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me. 
GEN.31.6	You know that I’ve worked for your father with all my strength, 
GEN.31.7	yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me. 
GEN.31.8	If he said, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked young. 
GEN.31.9	So God has taken away your father’s livestock and has given them to me.
GEN.31.10	“In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted. 
GEN.31.11	The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob.’ I answered, ‘Here I am.’ 
GEN.31.12	And he said, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you. 
GEN.31.13	I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.’ ”
GEN.31.14	Then Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father’s estate? 
GEN.31.15	Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us. 
GEN.31.16	Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.”
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels, 
GEN.31.18	and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram,
GEN.31.19	When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household gods. 
GEN.31.20	Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away. 
GEN.31.21	So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead.
GEN.31.22	On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled. 
GEN.31.23	Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”
GEN.31.25	Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too. 
GEN.31.26	Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You’ve deceived me, and you’ve carried off my daughters like captives in war. 
GEN.31.27	Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps? 
GEN.31.28	You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have done a foolish thing. 
GEN.31.29	I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’ 
GEN.31.30	Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father’s household. But why did you steal my gods?”
GEN.31.31	Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force. 
GEN.31.32	But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
GEN.31.33	So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah’s tent, he entered Rachel’s tent. 
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel’s saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.
GEN.31.35	Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I’m having my period.” So he searched but could not find the household gods.
GEN.31.36	Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. “What is my crime?” he asked Laban. “How have I wronged you that you hunt me down? 
GEN.31.37	Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.
GEN.31.38	“I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks. 
GEN.31.39	I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night. 
GEN.31.40	This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes. 
GEN.31.41	It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times. 
GEN.31.42	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you.”
GEN.31.43	Laban answered Jacob, “The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne? 
GEN.31.44	Come now, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.”
GEN.31.45	So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. 
GEN.31.46	He said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap. 
GEN.31.47	Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.
GEN.31.48	Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me today.” That is why it was called Galeed. 
GEN.31.49	It was also called Mizpah,
GEN.31.50	If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.”
GEN.31.51	Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me. 
GEN.31.52	This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me. 
GEN.31.53	May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.”
GEN.31.53	So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac. 
GEN.31.54	He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.
GEN.31.55	Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.
GEN.32.1	Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
GEN.32.2	When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now. 
GEN.32.5	I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.’ ”
GEN.32.6	When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”
GEN.32.7	In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups,
GEN.32.8	He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group,
GEN.32.9	Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, 
GEN.32.10	I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps. 
GEN.32.11	Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children. 
GEN.32.12	But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’ ”
GEN.32.13	He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau: 
GEN.32.14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. 
GEN.32.16	He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.”
GEN.32.17	He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’ 
GEN.32.18	then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’ ”
GEN.32.19	He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him. 
GEN.32.20	And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’ ” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.” 
GEN.32.21	So Jacob’s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.
GEN.32.22	That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 
GEN.32.23	After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. 
GEN.32.24	So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. 
GEN.32.25	When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. 
GEN.32.26	Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.”
GEN.32.26	But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
GEN.32.27	The man asked him, “What is your name?”
GEN.32.27	“Jacob,” he answered.
GEN.32.28	Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel,
GEN.32.29	Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.”
GEN.32.29	But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there.
GEN.32.30	So Jacob called the place Peniel,
GEN.32.31	The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel,
GEN.32.32	Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon.
GEN.33.1	Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants. 
GEN.33.2	He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. 
GEN.33.3	He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept. 
GEN.33.5	Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked.
GEN.33.5	Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.”
GEN.33.6	Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down. 
GEN.33.7	Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.
GEN.33.8	Esau asked, “What’s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?”
GEN.33.8	“To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” he said.
GEN.33.9	But Esau said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.”
GEN.33.10	“No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably. 
GEN.33.11	Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.
GEN.33.12	Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I’ll accompany you.”
GEN.33.13	But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die. 
GEN.33.14	So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”
GEN.33.15	Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.”
GEN.33.15	“But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”
GEN.33.16	So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir. 
GEN.33.17	Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth.
GEN.33.18	After Jacob came from Paddan Aram,
GEN.33.19	For a hundred pieces of silver,
GEN.33.20	There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.
GEN.34.1	Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land. 
GEN.34.2	When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her. 
GEN.34.3	His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her. 
GEN.34.4	And Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as my wife.”
GEN.34.5	When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he did nothing about it until they came home.
GEN.34.6	Then Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob. 
GEN.34.7	Meanwhile, Jacob’s sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious, because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in
GEN.34.8	But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife. 
GEN.34.9	Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves. 
GEN.34.10	You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade
GEN.34.11	Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask. 
GEN.34.12	Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I’ll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the young woman as my wife.”
GEN.34.13	Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob’s sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor. 
GEN.34.14	They said to them, “We can’t do such a thing; we can’t give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us. 
GEN.34.15	We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males. 
GEN.34.16	Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We’ll settle among you and become one people with you. 
GEN.34.17	But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we’ll take our sister and go.”
GEN.34.18	Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. 
GEN.34.19	The young man, who was the most honored of all his father’s family, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. 
GEN.34.20	So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to the men of their city. 
GEN.34.21	“These men are friendly toward us,” they said. “Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours. 
GEN.34.22	But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are. 
GEN.34.23	Won’t their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us agree to their terms, and they will settle among us.”
GEN.34.24	All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.
GEN.34.25	Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male. 
GEN.34.26	They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem’s house and left. 
GEN.34.27	The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where
GEN.34.28	They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields. 
GEN.34.29	They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses.
GEN.34.30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”
GEN.34.31	But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”
GEN.35.1	Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.”
GEN.35.2	So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes. 
GEN.35.3	Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.” 
GEN.35.4	So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem. 
GEN.35.5	Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.
GEN.35.6	Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.35.7	There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel,
GEN.35.8	Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth.
GEN.35.9	After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram,
GEN.35.10	God said to him, “Your name is Jacob,
GEN.35.11	And God said to him, “I am God Almighty
GEN.35.12	The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.” 
GEN.35.13	Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him.
GEN.35.14	Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it. 
GEN.35.15	Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel.
GEN.35.16	Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty. 
GEN.35.17	And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t despair, for you have another son.” 
GEN.35.18	As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni.
GEN.35.19	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
GEN.35.20	Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel’s tomb.
GEN.35.21	Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder. 
GEN.35.22	While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it.
GEN.35.22	Jacob had twelve sons:
GEN.35.23	The sons of Leah:
GEN.35.23	Reuben the firstborn of Jacob,
GEN.35.23	Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun.
GEN.35.24	The sons of Rachel:
GEN.35.24	Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.35.25	The sons of Rachel’s servant Bilhah:
GEN.35.25	Dan and Naphtali.
GEN.35.26	The sons of Leah’s servant Zilpah:
GEN.35.26	Gad and Asher.
GEN.35.26	These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.
GEN.35.27	Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. 
GEN.35.28	Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years. 
GEN.35.29	Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	This is the account of the family line of Esau (that is, Edom).
GEN.36.2	Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite— 
GEN.36.3	also Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
GEN.36.4	Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel, 
GEN.36.5	and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in Canaan.
GEN.36.6	Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the members of his household, as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	Their possessions were too great for them to remain together; the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock. 
GEN.36.8	So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir.
GEN.36.9	This is the account of the family line of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
GEN.36.10	These are the names of Esau’s sons:
GEN.36.10	Eliphaz, the son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.11	The sons of Eliphaz:
GEN.36.11	Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz.
GEN.36.12	Esau’s son Eliphaz also had a concubine named Timna, who bore him Amalek. These were grandsons of Esau’s wife Adah.
GEN.36.13	The sons of Reuel:
GEN.36.13	Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.14	The sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon, whom she bore to Esau:
GEN.36.14	Jeush, Jalam and Korah.
GEN.36.15	These were the chiefs among Esau’s descendants:
GEN.36.15	The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau:
GEN.36.15	Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	Korah,
GEN.36.17	The sons of Esau’s son Reuel:
GEN.36.17	Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in Edom; they were grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.18	The sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah:
GEN.36.18	Chiefs Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
GEN.36.19	These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these were their chiefs.
GEN.36.20	These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the region:
GEN.36.20	Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These sons of Seir in Edom were Horite chiefs.
GEN.36.22	The sons of Lotan:
GEN.36.22	Hori and Homam.
GEN.36.23	The sons of Shobal:
GEN.36.23	Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
GEN.36.24	The sons of Zibeon:
GEN.36.24	Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs
GEN.36.25	The children of Anah:
GEN.36.25	Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
GEN.36.26	The sons of Dishon
GEN.36.26	Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran and Keran.
GEN.36.27	The sons of Ezer:
GEN.36.27	Bilhan, Zaavan and Akan.
GEN.36.28	The sons of Dishan:
GEN.36.28	Uz and Aran.
GEN.36.29	These were the Horite chiefs:
GEN.36.29	Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.30	Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These were the Horite chiefs, according to their divisions, in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.31	These were the kings who reigned in Edom before any Israelite king reigned:
GEN.36.32	Bela son of Beor became king of Edom. His city was named Dinhabah.
GEN.36.33	When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah succeeded him as king.
GEN.36.34	When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king.
GEN.36.35	When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king. His city was named Avith.
GEN.36.36	When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah succeeded him as king.
GEN.36.37	When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the river succeeded him as king.
GEN.36.38	When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of Akbor succeeded him as king.
GEN.36.39	When Baal-Hanan son of Akbor died, Hadad
GEN.36.40	These were the chiefs descended from Esau, by name, according to their clans and regions:
GEN.36.40	Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 
GEN.36.41	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	Magdiel and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they occupied.
GEN.36.43	This is the family line of Esau, the father of the Edomites.
GEN.37.1	Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
GEN.37.2	This is the account of Jacob’s family line.
GEN.37.2	Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made an ornate
GEN.37.4	When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.
GEN.37.5	Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. 
GEN.37.6	He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had: 
GEN.37.7	We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.”
GEN.37.8	His brothers said to him, “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?” And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.
GEN.37.9	Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
GEN.37.10	When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?” 
GEN.37.11	His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.
GEN.37.12	Now his brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem, 
GEN.37.13	and Israel said to Joseph, “As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.”
GEN.37.13	“Very well,” he replied.
GEN.37.14	So he said to him, “Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.” Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron.
GEN.37.14	When Joseph arrived at Shechem, 
GEN.37.15	a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, “What are you looking for?”
GEN.37.16	He replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?”
GEN.37.17	“They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’ ”
GEN.37.17	So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan. 
GEN.37.18	But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
GEN.37.19	“Here comes that dreamer!” they said to each other. 
GEN.37.20	“Come now, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we’ll see what comes of his dreams.”
GEN.37.21	When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. “Let’s not take his life,” he said. 
GEN.37.22	“Don’t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.
GEN.37.23	So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the ornate robe he was wearing— 
GEN.37.24	and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it.
GEN.37.25	As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
GEN.37.26	Judah said to his brothers, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? 
GEN.37.27	Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” His brothers agreed.
GEN.37.28	So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels
GEN.37.29	When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes. 
GEN.37.30	He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy isn’t there! Where can I turn now?”
GEN.37.31	Then they got Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. 
GEN.37.32	They took the ornate robe back to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe.”
GEN.37.33	He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.”
GEN.37.34	Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days. 
GEN.37.35	All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave.” So his father wept for him.
GEN.37.36	Meanwhile, the Midianites
GEN.38.1	At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and made love to her; 
GEN.38.3	she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er. 
GEN.38.4	She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan. 
GEN.38.5	She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him.
GEN.38.6	Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the 
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.” 
GEN.38.9	But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother. 
GEN.38.10	What he did was wicked in the 
GEN.38.11	Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s household until my son Shelah grows up.” For he thought, “He may die too, just like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s household.
GEN.38.12	After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him.
GEN.38.13	When Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,” 
GEN.38.14	she took off her widow’s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife.
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. 
GEN.38.16	Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, “Come now, let me sleep with you.”
GEN.38.16	“And what will you give me to sleep with you?” she asked.
GEN.38.17	“I’ll send you a young goat from my flock,” he said.
GEN.38.17	“Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?” she asked.
GEN.38.18	He said, “What pledge should I give you?”
GEN.38.18	“Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand,” she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. 
GEN.38.19	After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow’s clothes again.
GEN.38.20	Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her. 
GEN.38.21	He asked the men who lived there, “Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?”
GEN.38.21	“There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here,” they said.
GEN.38.22	So he went back to Judah and said, “I didn’t find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, ‘There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here.’ ”
GEN.38.23	Then Judah said, “Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn’t find her.”
GEN.38.24	About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.”
GEN.38.24	Judah said, “Bring her out and have her burned to death!”
GEN.38.25	As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. “I am pregnant by the man who owns these,” she said. And she added, “See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.”
GEN.38.26	Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn’t give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not sleep with her again.
GEN.38.27	When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. 
GEN.38.28	As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, “This one came out first.” 
GEN.38.29	But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, “So this is how you have broken out!” And he was named Perez.
GEN.38.30	Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out. And he was named Zerah.
GEN.39.1	Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
GEN.39.2	The 
GEN.39.3	When his master saw that the 
GEN.39.4	Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned. 
GEN.39.5	From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the 
GEN.39.6	So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph’s care; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.
GEN.39.6	Now Joseph was well-built and handsome, 
GEN.39.7	and after a while his master’s wife took notice of Joseph and said, “Come to bed with me!”
GEN.39.8	But he refused. “With me in charge,” he told her, “my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care. 
GEN.39.9	No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?” 
GEN.39.10	And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.
GEN.39.11	One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside. 
GEN.39.12	She caught him by his cloak and said, “Come to bed with me!” But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.
GEN.39.13	When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house, 
GEN.39.14	she called her household servants. “Look,” she said to them, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed. 
GEN.39.15	When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”
GEN.39.16	She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home. 
GEN.39.17	Then she told him this story: “That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me. 
GEN.39.18	But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”
GEN.39.19	When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is how your slave treated me,” he burned with anger. 
GEN.39.20	Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined.
GEN.39.20	But while Joseph was there in the prison, 
GEN.39.21	the 
GEN.39.22	So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there. 
GEN.39.23	The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care, because the 
GEN.40.1	Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt. 
GEN.40.2	Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, 
GEN.40.3	and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined. 
GEN.40.4	The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them.
GEN.40.4	After they had been in custody for some time, 
GEN.40.5	each of the two men—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison—had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
GEN.40.6	When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected. 
GEN.40.7	So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?”
GEN.40.8	“We both had dreams,” they answered, “but there is no one to interpret them.”
GEN.40.8	Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”
GEN.40.9	So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine in front of me, 
GEN.40.10	and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes. 
GEN.40.11	Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in his hand.”
GEN.40.12	“This is what it means,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days. 
GEN.40.13	Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer. 
GEN.40.14	But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison. 
GEN.40.15	I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.”
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread.
GEN.40.17	In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”
GEN.40.18	“This is what it means,” Joseph said. “The three baskets are three days. 
GEN.40.19	Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh.”
GEN.40.20	Now the third day was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials: 
GEN.40.21	He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand— 
GEN.40.22	but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.
GEN.40.23	The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
GEN.41.1	When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile, 
GEN.41.2	when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds. 
GEN.41.3	After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank. 
GEN.41.4	And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
GEN.41.5	He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk. 
GEN.41.6	After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind. 
GEN.41.7	The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.
GEN.41.8	In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
GEN.41.9	Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I am reminded of my shortcomings. 
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard. 
GEN.41.11	Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. 
GEN.41.12	Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream. 
GEN.41.13	And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was impaled.”
GEN.41.14	So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.
GEN.41.15	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”
GEN.41.16	“I cannot do it,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.”
GEN.41.17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 
GEN.41.18	when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds. 
GEN.41.19	After them, seven other cows came up—scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.20	The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first. 
GEN.41.21	But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.
GEN.41.22	“In my dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk. 
GEN.41.23	After them, seven other heads sprouted—withered and thin and scorched by the east wind. 
GEN.41.24	The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.”
GEN.41.25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream. 
GEN.41.27	The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine.
GEN.41.28	“It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.29	Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt, 
GEN.41.30	but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land. 
GEN.41.31	The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe. 
GEN.41.32	The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.
GEN.41.33	“And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. 
GEN.41.35	They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food. 
GEN.41.36	This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.”
GEN.41.37	The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials. 
GEN.41.38	So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God
GEN.41.39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you. 
GEN.41.40	You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.”
GEN.41.41	So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. 
GEN.41.43	He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command,
GEN.41.44	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.” 
GEN.41.45	Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On,
GEN.41.46	Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout Egypt. 
GEN.41.47	During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully. 
GEN.41.48	Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it. 
GEN.41.49	Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.
GEN.41.50	Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. 
GEN.41.51	Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh
GEN.41.52	The second son he named Ephraim
GEN.41.53	The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, 
GEN.41.54	and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food. 
GEN.41.55	When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.”
GEN.41.56	When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt. 
GEN.41.57	And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere.
GEN.42.1	When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you just keep looking at each other?” 
GEN.42.2	He continued, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.”
GEN.42.3	Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him. 
GEN.42.5	So Israel’s sons were among those who went to buy grain, for there was famine in the land of Canaan also.
GEN.42.6	Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the person who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground. 
GEN.42.7	As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. “Where do you come from?” he asked.
GEN.42.7	“From the land of Canaan,” they replied, “to buy food.”
GEN.42.8	Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. 
GEN.42.9	Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected.”
GEN.42.10	“No, my lord,” they answered. “Your servants have come to buy food. 
GEN.42.11	We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.”
GEN.42.12	“No!” he said to them. “You have come to see where our land is unprotected.”
GEN.42.13	But they replied, “Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.”
GEN.42.14	Joseph said to them, “It is just as I told you: You are spies! 
GEN.42.15	And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. 
GEN.42.16	Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!” 
GEN.42.17	And he put them all in custody for three days.
GEN.42.18	On the third day, Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God: 
GEN.42.19	If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households. 
GEN.42.20	But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die.” This they proceeded to do.
GEN.42.21	They said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that’s why this distress has come on us.”
GEN.42.22	Reuben replied, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn’t listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood.” 
GEN.42.23	They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.
GEN.42.24	He turned away from them and began to weep, but then came back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.
GEN.42.25	Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man’s silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them, 
GEN.42.26	they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
GEN.42.27	At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack. 
GEN.42.28	“My silver has been returned,” he said to his brothers. “Here it is in my sack.”
GEN.42.28	Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”
GEN.42.29	When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said, 
GEN.42.30	“The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land. 
GEN.42.31	But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies. 
GEN.42.32	We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.’
GEN.42.33	“Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go. 
GEN.42.34	But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade
GEN.42.35	As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened. 
GEN.42.36	Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!”
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben said to his father, “You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back.”
GEN.42.38	But Jacob said, “My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.”
GEN.43.1	Now the famine was still severe in the land. 
GEN.43.2	So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.”
GEN.43.3	But Judah said to him, “The man warned us solemnly, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’ 
GEN.43.4	If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you. 
GEN.43.5	But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’ ”
GEN.43.6	Israel asked, “Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?”
GEN.43.7	They replied, “The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. ‘Is your father still living?’ he asked us. ‘Do you have another brother?’ We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”
GEN.43.8	Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die. 
GEN.43.9	I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life. 
GEN.43.10	As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice.”
GEN.43.11	Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift—a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds. 
GEN.43.12	Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake. 
GEN.43.13	Take your brother also and go back to the man at once. 
GEN.43.14	And may God Almighty
GEN.43.15	So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph. 
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare a meal; they are to eat with me at noon.”
GEN.43.17	The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph’s house. 
GEN.43.18	Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, “We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys.”
GEN.43.19	So they went up to Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house. 
GEN.43.20	“We beg your pardon, our lord,” they said, “we came down here the first time to buy food. 
GEN.43.21	But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver—the exact weight—in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us. 
GEN.43.22	We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don’t know who put our silver in our sacks.”
GEN.43.23	“It’s all right,” he said. “Don’t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
GEN.43.24	The steward took the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys. 
GEN.43.25	They prepared their gifts for Joseph’s arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there.
GEN.43.26	When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground. 
GEN.43.27	He asked them how they were, and then he said, “How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?”
GEN.43.28	They replied, “Your servant our father is still alive and well.” And they bowed down, prostrating themselves before him.
GEN.43.29	As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” And he said, “God be gracious to you, my son.” 
GEN.43.30	Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there.
GEN.43.31	After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, “Serve the food.”
GEN.43.32	They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians. 
GEN.43.33	The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment. 
GEN.43.34	When portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as anyone else’s. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
GEN.44.1	Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house: “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his sack. 
GEN.44.2	Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his grain.” And he did as Joseph said.
GEN.44.3	As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, “Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil? 
GEN.44.5	Isn’t this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.’ ”
GEN.44.6	When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them. 
GEN.44.7	But they said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that! 
GEN.44.8	We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house? 
GEN.44.9	If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.”
GEN.44.10	“Very well, then,” he said, “let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame.”
GEN.44.11	Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it. 
GEN.44.12	Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
GEN.44.13	At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him. 
GEN.44.15	Joseph said to them, “What is this you have done? Don’t you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?”
GEN.44.16	“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants’ guilt. We are now my lord’s slaves—we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.”
GEN.44.17	But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace.”
GEN.44.18	Then Judah went up to him and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, let me speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself. 
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	And we answered, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’
GEN.44.21	“Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.’ 
GEN.44.22	And we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.’ 
GEN.44.23	But you told your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’ 
GEN.44.24	When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said.
GEN.44.25	“Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy a little more food.’ 
GEN.44.26	But we said, ‘We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’
GEN.44.27	“Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons. 
GEN.44.28	One of them went away from me, and I said, “He has surely been torn to pieces.” And I have not seen him since. 
GEN.44.29	If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.’
GEN.44.30	“So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father, and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy’s life, 
GEN.44.31	sees that the boy isn’t there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow. 
GEN.44.32	Your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father. I said, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!’
GEN.44.33	“Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come on my father.”
GEN.45.1	Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Have everyone leave my presence!” So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers. 
GEN.45.2	And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household heard about it.
GEN.45.3	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?” But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence.
GEN.45.4	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me.” When they had done so, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! 
GEN.45.5	And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. 
GEN.45.6	For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping. 
GEN.45.7	But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
GEN.45.8	“So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt. 
GEN.45.9	Now hurry back to my father and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don’t delay. 
GEN.45.10	You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me—you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have. 
GEN.45.11	I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.’
GEN.45.12	“You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you. 
GEN.45.13	Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.”
GEN.45.14	Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping. 
GEN.45.15	And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him.
GEN.45.16	When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased. 
GEN.45.17	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan, 
GEN.45.18	and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.’
GEN.45.19	“You are also directed to tell them, ‘Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come. 
GEN.45.20	Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.’ ”
GEN.45.21	So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey. 
GEN.45.22	To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels
GEN.45.23	And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey. 
GEN.45.24	Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, “Don’t quarrel on the way!”
GEN.45.25	So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.45.26	They told him, “Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt.” Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them. 
GEN.45.27	But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. 
GEN.45.28	And Israel said, “I’m convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
GEN.46.2	And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, “Jacob! Jacob!”
GEN.46.2	“Here I am,” he replied.
GEN.46.3	“I am God, the God of your father,” he said. “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. 
GEN.46.4	I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph’s own hand will close your eyes.”
GEN.46.5	Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel’s sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him. 
GEN.46.6	So Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt, taking with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan. 
GEN.46.7	Jacob brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters—all his offspring.
GEN.46.8	These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt:
GEN.46.8	Reuben the firstborn of Jacob.
GEN.46.9	The sons of Reuben:
GEN.46.9	Hanok, Pallu, Hezron and Karmi.
GEN.46.10	The sons of Simeon:
GEN.46.10	Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
GEN.46.11	The sons of Levi:
GEN.46.11	Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
GEN.46.12	The sons of Judah:
GEN.46.12	Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan).
GEN.46.12	The sons of Perez:
GEN.46.12	Hezron and Hamul.
GEN.46.13	The sons of Issachar:
GEN.46.13	Tola, Puah,
GEN.46.14	The sons of Zebulun:
GEN.46.14	Sered, Elon and Jahleel.
GEN.46.15	These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram,
GEN.46.16	The sons of Gad:
GEN.46.16	Zephon,
GEN.46.17	The sons of Asher:
GEN.46.17	Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi and Beriah.
GEN.46.17	Their sister was Serah.
GEN.46.17	The sons of Beriah:
GEN.46.17	Heber and Malkiel.
GEN.46.18	These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah—sixteen in all.
GEN.46.19	The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel:
GEN.46.19	Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
GEN.46.21	The sons of Benjamin:
GEN.46.21	Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard.
GEN.46.22	These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob—fourteen in all.
GEN.46.23	The son of Dan:
GEN.46.23	Hushim.
GEN.46.24	The sons of Naphtali:
GEN.46.24	Jahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem.
GEN.46.25	These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel—seven in all.
GEN.46.26	All those who went to Egypt with Jacob—those who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons’ wives—numbered sixty-six persons. 
GEN.46.27	With the two sons
GEN.46.28	Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen, 
GEN.46.29	Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around his father
GEN.46.30	Israel said to Joseph, “Now I am ready to die, since I have seen for myself that you are still alive.”
GEN.46.31	Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to me. 
GEN.46.32	The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.’ 
GEN.46.33	When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
GEN.46.34	you should answer, ‘Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.’ Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.”
GEN.47.1	Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father and brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.” 
GEN.47.2	He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
GEN.47.3	Pharaoh asked the brothers, “What is your occupation?”
GEN.47.3	“Your servants are shepherds,” they replied to Pharaoh, “just as our fathers were.” 
GEN.47.4	They also said to him, “We have come to live here for a while, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants’ flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen.”
GEN.47.5	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you, 
GEN.47.6	and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any among them with special ability, put them in charge of my own livestock.”
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed
GEN.47.8	Pharaoh asked him, “How old are you?”
GEN.47.9	And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers.” 
GEN.47.10	Then Jacob blessed
GEN.47.11	So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed. 
GEN.47.12	Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with food, according to the number of their children.
GEN.47.13	There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine. 
GEN.47.14	Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh’s palace. 
GEN.47.15	When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is all gone.”
GEN.47.16	“Then bring your livestock,” said Joseph. “I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your money is gone.” 
GEN.47.17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock.
GEN.47.18	When that year was over, they came to him the following year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land. 
GEN.47.19	Why should we perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.”
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh’s, 
GEN.47.21	and Joseph reduced the people to servitude,
GEN.47.22	However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.
GEN.47.23	Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground. 
GEN.47.24	But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children.”
GEN.47.25	“You have saved our lives,” they said. “May we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh.”
GEN.47.26	So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt—still in force today—that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh’s.
GEN.47.27	Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number.
GEN.47.28	Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven. 
GEN.47.29	When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, 
GEN.47.30	but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.”
GEN.47.30	“I will do as you say,” he said.
GEN.47.31	“Swear to me,” he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
GEN.48.1	Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him. 
GEN.48.2	When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed.
GEN.48.3	Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty
GEN.48.4	and said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.’
GEN.48.5	“Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. 
GEN.48.6	Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers. 
GEN.48.7	As I was returning from Paddan,
GEN.48.8	When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?”
GEN.48.9	“They are the sons God has given me here,” Joseph said to his father.
GEN.48.9	Then Israel said, “Bring them to me so I may bless them.”
GEN.48.10	Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.
GEN.48.11	Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.”
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph removed them from Israel’s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground. 
GEN.48.13	And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them close to him. 
GEN.48.14	But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim’s head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.
GEN.48.15	Then he blessed Joseph and said,
GEN.48.15	“May the God before whom my fathers
GEN.48.15	Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully,
GEN.48.15	the God who has been my shepherd
GEN.48.15	all my life to this day,
GEN.48.16	the Angel who has delivered me from all harm
GEN.48.16	—may he bless these boys.
GEN.48.16	May they be called by my name
GEN.48.16	and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,
GEN.48.16	and may they increase greatly
GEN.48.16	on the earth.”
GEN.48.17	When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim’s head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. 
GEN.48.18	Joseph said to him, “No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”
GEN.48.19	But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations.” 
GEN.48.20	He blessed them that day and said,
GEN.48.20	“In your
GEN.48.20	‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’ ”
GEN.48.20	So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
GEN.48.21	Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you
GEN.48.22	And to you I give one more ridge of land
GEN.49.1	Then Jacob called for his sons and said: “Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.
GEN.49.2	“Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob;
GEN.49.2	listen to your father Israel.
GEN.49.3	“Reuben, you are my firstborn,
GEN.49.3	my might, the first sign of my strength,
GEN.49.3	excelling in honor, excelling in power.
GEN.49.4	Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel,
GEN.49.4	for you went up onto your father’s bed,
GEN.49.4	onto my couch and defiled it.
GEN.49.5	“Simeon and Levi are brothers—
GEN.49.5	their swords
GEN.49.6	Let me not enter their council,
GEN.49.6	let me not join their assembly,
GEN.49.6	for they have killed men in their anger
GEN.49.6	and hamstrung oxen as they pleased.
GEN.49.7	Cursed be their anger, so fierce,
GEN.49.7	and their fury, so cruel!
GEN.49.7	I will scatter them in Jacob
GEN.49.7	and disperse them in Israel.
GEN.49.8	“Judah,
GEN.49.8	your hand will be on the neck of your enemies;
GEN.49.8	your father’s sons will bow down to you.
GEN.49.9	You are a lion’s cub, Judah;
GEN.49.9	you return from the prey, my son.
GEN.49.9	Like a lion he crouches and lies down,
GEN.49.9	like a lioness—who dares to rouse him?
GEN.49.10	The scepter will not depart from Judah,
GEN.49.10	nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,
GEN.49.10	until he to whom it belongs
GEN.49.10	and the obedience of the nations shall be his.
GEN.49.11	He will tether his donkey to a vine,
GEN.49.11	his colt to the choicest branch;
GEN.49.11	he will wash his garments in wine,
GEN.49.11	his robes in the blood of grapes.
GEN.49.12	His eyes will be darker than wine,
GEN.49.12	his teeth whiter than milk.
GEN.49.13	“Zebulun will live by the seashore
GEN.49.13	and become a haven for ships;
GEN.49.13	his border will extend toward Sidon.
GEN.49.14	“Issachar is a rawboned
GEN.49.14	lying down among the sheep pens.
GEN.49.15	When he sees how good is his resting place
GEN.49.15	and how pleasant is his land,
GEN.49.15	he will bend his shoulder to the burden
GEN.49.15	and submit to forced labor.
GEN.49.16	“Dan
GEN.49.16	as one of the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan will be a snake by the roadside,
GEN.49.17	a viper along the path,
GEN.49.17	that bites the horse’s heels
GEN.49.17	so that its rider tumbles backward.
GEN.49.18	“I look for your deliverance, 
GEN.49.19	“Gad
GEN.49.19	but he will attack them at their heels.
GEN.49.20	“Asher’s food will be rich;
GEN.49.20	he will provide delicacies fit for a king.
GEN.49.21	“Naphtali is a doe set free
GEN.49.21	that bears beautiful fawns.
GEN.49.22	“Joseph is a fruitful vine,
GEN.49.22	a fruitful vine near a spring,
GEN.49.22	whose branches climb over a wall.
GEN.49.23	With bitterness archers attacked him;
GEN.49.23	they shot at him with hostility.
GEN.49.24	But his bow remained steady,
GEN.49.24	his strong arms stayed
GEN.49.24	because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob,
GEN.49.24	because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
GEN.49.25	because of your father’s God, who helps you,
GEN.49.25	because of the Almighty,
GEN.49.25	with blessings of the skies above,
GEN.49.25	blessings of the deep springs below,
GEN.49.25	blessings of the breast and womb.
GEN.49.26	Your father’s blessings are greater
GEN.49.26	than the blessings of the ancient mountains,
GEN.49.26	than
GEN.49.26	Let all these rest on the head of Joseph,
GEN.49.26	on the brow of the prince among
GEN.49.27	“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf;
GEN.49.27	in the morning he devours the prey,
GEN.49.27	in the evening he divides the plunder.”
GEN.49.28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him.
GEN.49.29	Then he gave them these instructions: “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
GEN.49.30	the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite. 
GEN.49.31	There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah. 
GEN.49.32	The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites.
GEN.49.33	When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people.
GEN.50.1	Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him, 
GEN.50.3	taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
GEN.50.4	When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court, “If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him, 
GEN.50.5	‘My father made me swear an oath and said, “I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.’ ”
GEN.50.6	Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.”
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh’s officials accompanied him—the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt— 
GEN.50.8	besides all the members of Joseph’s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father’s household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	Chariots and horsemen
GEN.50.10	When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father. 
GEN.50.11	When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.” That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.
GEN.50.12	So Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them: 
GEN.50.13	They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite. 
GEN.50.14	After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father.
GEN.50.15	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?” 
GEN.50.16	So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father left these instructions before he died: 
GEN.50.17	‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.’ Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.” When their message came to him, Joseph wept.
GEN.50.18	His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. “We are your slaves,” they said.
GEN.50.19	But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God? 
GEN.50.20	You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. 
GEN.50.21	So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.” And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.
GEN.50.22	Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years 
GEN.50.23	and saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph’s knees.
GEN.50.24	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” 
GEN.50.25	And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.”
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: 
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; 
EXO.1.4	Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy
EXO.1.6	Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, 
EXO.1.7	but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.
EXO.1.8	Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. 
EXO.1.9	“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. 
EXO.1.10	Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”
EXO.1.11	So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 
EXO.1.12	But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites 
EXO.1.13	and worked them ruthlessly. 
EXO.1.14	They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly.
EXO.1.15	The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, 
EXO.1.16	“When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.” 
EXO.1.17	The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. 
EXO.1.18	Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”
EXO.1.19	The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”
EXO.1.20	So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. 
EXO.1.21	And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
EXO.1.22	Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”
EXO.2.1	Now a man of the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman, 
EXO.2.2	and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months. 
EXO.2.3	But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket
EXO.2.4	His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
EXO.2.5	Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it. 
EXO.2.6	She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said.
EXO.2.7	Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?”
EXO.2.8	“Yes, go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother. 
EXO.2.9	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him. 
EXO.2.10	When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses,
EXO.2.11	One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. 
EXO.2.12	Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 
EXO.2.13	The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?”
EXO.2.14	The man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.”
EXO.2.15	When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well. 
EXO.2.16	Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
EXO.2.17	Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.
EXO.2.18	When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?”
EXO.2.19	They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”
EXO.2.20	“And where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.”
EXO.2.21	Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. 
EXO.2.22	Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom,
EXO.2.23	During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God. 
EXO.2.24	God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.
EXO.3.1	Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. 
EXO.3.2	There the angel of the 
EXO.3.3	So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.”
EXO.3.4	When the 
EXO.3.4	And Moses said, “Here I am.”
EXO.3.5	“Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.” 
EXO.3.6	Then he said, “I am the God of your father,
EXO.3.7	The 
EXO.3.8	So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
EXO.3.9	And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. 
EXO.3.10	So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”
EXO.3.11	But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
EXO.3.12	And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you
EXO.3.13	Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”
EXO.3.14	God said to Moses, “
EXO.3.15	God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The 
EXO.3.15	“This is my name forever,
EXO.3.15	the name you shall call me
EXO.3.15	from generation to generation.
EXO.3.16	“Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The 
EXO.3.17	And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’
EXO.3.18	“The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The 
EXO.3.19	But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him. 
EXO.3.20	So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.
EXO.3.21	“And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed. 
EXO.3.22	Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.”
EXO.4.1	Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, ‘The 
EXO.4.2	Then the 
EXO.4.2	“A staff,” he replied.
EXO.4.3	The 
EXO.4.3	Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it. 
EXO.4.4	Then the 
EXO.4.5	“This,” said the 
EXO.4.6	Then the 
EXO.4.7	“Now put it back into your cloak,” he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.
EXO.4.8	Then the 
EXO.4.9	But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground.”
EXO.4.10	Moses said to the 
EXO.4.11	The 
EXO.4.12	Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.”
EXO.4.13	But Moses said, “Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else.”
EXO.4.14	Then the 
EXO.4.15	You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do. 
EXO.4.16	He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him. 
EXO.4.17	But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it.”
EXO.4.18	Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.”
EXO.4.18	Jethro said, “Go, and I wish you well.”
EXO.4.19	Now the 
EXO.4.20	So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.
EXO.4.21	The 
EXO.4.22	Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the 
EXO.4.23	and I told you, “Let my son go, so he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.’ ”
EXO.4.24	At a lodging place on the way, the 
EXO.4.25	But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’ feet with it.
EXO.4.26	So the 
EXO.4.27	The 
EXO.4.28	Then Moses told Aaron everything the 
EXO.4.29	Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites, 
EXO.4.30	and Aaron told them everything the 
EXO.4.31	and they believed. And when they heard that the 
EXO.5.1	Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the 
EXO.5.2	Pharaoh said, “Who is the 
EXO.5.3	Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.5.4	But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!” 
EXO.5.5	Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.”
EXO.5.6	That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people: 
EXO.5.7	“You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw. 
EXO.5.8	But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ 
EXO.5.9	Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.”
EXO.5.10	Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw. 
EXO.5.11	Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’ ” 
EXO.5.12	So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. 
EXO.5.13	The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.” 
EXO.5.14	And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”
EXO.5.15	Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way? 
EXO.5.16	Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”
EXO.5.17	Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the 
EXO.5.18	Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.”
EXO.5.19	The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.” 
EXO.5.20	When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them, 
EXO.5.21	and they said, “May the 
EXO.5.22	Moses returned to the 
EXO.5.23	Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.”
EXO.6.1	Then the 
EXO.6.2	God also said to Moses, “I am the 
EXO.6.3	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty,
EXO.6.4	I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners. 
EXO.6.5	Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.
EXO.6.6	“Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am the 
EXO.6.7	I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the 
EXO.6.8	And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the 
EXO.6.9	Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor.
EXO.6.10	Then the 
EXO.6.11	“Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.”
EXO.6.12	But Moses said to the 
EXO.6.13	Now the 
EXO.6.14	These were the heads of their families
EXO.6.14	The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanok and Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. These were the clans of Reuben.
EXO.6.15	The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.
EXO.6.16	These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei.
EXO.6.18	The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
EXO.6.19	The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi.
EXO.6.19	These were the clans of Levi according to their records.
EXO.6.20	Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
EXO.6.21	The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zikri.
EXO.6.22	The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri.
EXO.6.23	Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
EXO.6.24	The sons of Korah were: Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans.
EXO.6.25	Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas.
EXO.6.25	These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan.
EXO.6.26	It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the 
EXO.6.27	They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt—this same Moses and Aaron.
EXO.6.28	Now when the 
EXO.6.29	he said to him, “I am the 
EXO.6.30	But Moses said to the 
EXO.7.1	Then the 
EXO.7.2	You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country. 
EXO.7.3	But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in Egypt, 
EXO.7.4	he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites. 
EXO.7.5	And the Egyptians will know that I am the 
EXO.7.6	Moses and Aaron did just as the 
EXO.7.7	Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
EXO.7.8	The 
EXO.7.9	“When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ then say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will become a snake.”
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the 
EXO.7.11	Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts: 
EXO.7.12	Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. 
EXO.7.13	Yet Pharaoh’s heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the 
EXO.7.14	Then the 
EXO.7.15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake. 
EXO.7.16	Then say to him, ‘The 
EXO.7.17	This is what the 
EXO.7.18	The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.’ ”
EXO.7.19	The 
EXO.7.20	Moses and Aaron did just as the 
EXO.7.21	The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.
EXO.7.22	But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the 
EXO.7.23	Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart. 
EXO.7.24	And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river.
EXO.7.25	Seven days passed after the 
EXO.8.1	Then the 
EXO.8.2	If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country. 
EXO.8.3	The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs. 
EXO.8.4	The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’ ”
EXO.8.5	Then the 
EXO.8.6	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land. 
EXO.8.7	But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the 
EXO.8.9	Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile.”
EXO.8.10	“Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said.
EXO.8.10	Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the 
EXO.8.11	The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.”
EXO.8.12	After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the 
EXO.8.13	And the 
EXO.8.14	They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them. 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the 
EXO.8.16	Then the 
EXO.8.17	They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats. 
EXO.8.18	But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not.
EXO.8.18	Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere, 
EXO.8.19	the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the 
EXO.8.20	Then the 
EXO.8.21	If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them.
EXO.8.22	“ ‘But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the 
EXO.8.23	I will make a distinction
EXO.8.24	And the 
EXO.8.25	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.”
EXO.8.26	But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the 
EXO.8.27	We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.8.28	Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.8.29	Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the 
EXO.8.30	Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the 
EXO.8.31	and the 
EXO.8.32	But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back, 
EXO.9.3	the hand of the 
EXO.9.4	But the 
EXO.9.5	The 
EXO.9.6	And the next day the 
EXO.9.7	Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	Then the 
EXO.9.9	It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land.”
EXO.9.10	So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals. 
EXO.9.11	The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	But the 
EXO.9.13	Then the 
EXO.9.14	or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth. 
EXO.9.15	For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. 
EXO.9.16	But I have raised you up
EXO.9.17	You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go. 
EXO.9.18	Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now. 
EXO.9.19	Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.’ ”
EXO.9.20	Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the 
EXO.9.21	But those who ignored the word of the 
EXO.9.22	Then the 
EXO.9.23	When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the 
EXO.9.24	hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. 
EXO.9.25	Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree. 
EXO.9.26	The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were.
EXO.9.27	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said to them. “The 
EXO.9.28	Pray to the 
EXO.9.29	Moses replied, “When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the 
EXO.9.30	But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the 
EXO.9.31	(The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom. 
EXO.9.32	The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)
EXO.9.33	Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the 
EXO.9.34	When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts. 
EXO.9.35	So Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the 
EXO.10.1	Then the 
EXO.10.2	that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the 
EXO.10.3	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the 
EXO.10.4	If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow. 
EXO.10.5	They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields. 
EXO.10.6	They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.’ ” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
EXO.10.7	Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the 
EXO.10.8	Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the 
EXO.10.9	Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the 
EXO.10.10	Pharaoh said, “The 
EXO.10.11	No! Have only the men go and worship the 
EXO.10.12	And the 
EXO.10.13	So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the 
EXO.10.14	they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again. 
EXO.10.15	They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
EXO.10.16	Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the 
EXO.10.18	Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the 
EXO.10.19	And the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	Then the 
EXO.10.22	So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. 
EXO.10.23	No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
EXO.10.24	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the 
EXO.10.25	But Moses said, “You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the 
EXO.10.26	Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.”
EXO.10.29	“Just as you say,” Moses replied. “I will never appear before you again.”
EXO.11.1	Now the 
EXO.11.2	Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.” 
EXO.11.3	(The 
EXO.11.4	So Moses said, “This is what the 
EXO.11.5	Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. 
EXO.11.6	There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. 
EXO.11.7	But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.’ Then you will know that the 
EXO.11.8	All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that I will leave.” Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.
EXO.11.9	The 
EXO.11.10	Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the 
EXO.12.1	The 
EXO.12.2	“This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year. 
EXO.12.3	Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb
EXO.12.4	If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat. 
EXO.12.5	The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats. 
EXO.12.6	Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight. 
EXO.12.7	Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. 
EXO.12.8	That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast. 
EXO.12.9	Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs and internal organs. 
EXO.12.10	Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it. 
EXO.12.11	This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the 
EXO.12.12	“On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the 
EXO.12.13	The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.
EXO.12.14	“This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the 
EXO.12.15	For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel. 
EXO.12.16	On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do.
EXO.12.17	“Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. 
EXO.12.18	In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day. 
EXO.12.19	For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel. 
EXO.12.20	Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.”
EXO.12.21	Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb. 
EXO.12.22	Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning. 
EXO.12.23	When the 
EXO.12.24	“Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants. 
EXO.12.25	When you enter the land that the 
EXO.12.26	And when your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’ 
EXO.12.27	then tell them, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the 
EXO.12.28	The Israelites did just what the 
EXO.12.29	At midnight the 
EXO.12.30	Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.
EXO.12.31	During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the 
EXO.12.32	Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.”
EXO.12.33	The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. “For otherwise,” they said, “we will all die!” 
EXO.12.34	So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing. 
EXO.12.35	The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing. 
EXO.12.36	The 
EXO.12.37	The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children. 
EXO.12.38	Many other people went up with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds. 
EXO.12.39	With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.
EXO.12.40	Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt
EXO.12.41	At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the 
EXO.12.42	Because the 
EXO.12.43	The 
EXO.12.43	“No foreigner may eat it. 
EXO.12.44	Any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him, 
EXO.12.45	but a temporary resident or a hired worker may not eat it.
EXO.12.46	“It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones. 
EXO.12.47	The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
EXO.12.48	“A foreigner residing among you who wants to celebrate the 
EXO.12.49	The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you.”
EXO.12.50	All the Israelites did just what the 
EXO.12.51	And on that very day the 
EXO.13.1	The 
EXO.13.2	“Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal.”
EXO.13.3	Then Moses said to the people, “Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the 
EXO.13.4	Today, in the month of Aviv, you are leaving. 
EXO.13.5	When the 
EXO.13.6	For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the 
EXO.13.7	Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders. 
EXO.13.8	On that day tell your son, ‘I do this because of what the 
EXO.13.9	This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the 
EXO.13.10	You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.
EXO.13.11	“After the 
EXO.13.12	you are to give over to the 
EXO.13.13	Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons.
EXO.13.14	“In days to come, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ say to him, ‘With a mighty hand the 
EXO.13.15	When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the 
EXO.13.16	And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the 
EXO.13.17	When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, “If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.” 
EXO.13.18	So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea.
EXO.13.19	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.”
EXO.13.20	After leaving Sukkoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert. 
EXO.13.21	By day the 
EXO.13.22	Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
EXO.14.1	Then the 
EXO.14.2	“Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon. 
EXO.14.3	Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.’ 
EXO.14.4	And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the 
EXO.14.5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!” 
EXO.14.6	So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him. 
EXO.14.7	He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them. 
EXO.14.8	The 
EXO.14.9	The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen
EXO.14.10	As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the 
EXO.14.11	They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? 
EXO.14.12	Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”
EXO.14.13	Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	Then the 
EXO.14.16	Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground. 
EXO.14.17	I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen. 
EXO.14.18	The Egyptians will know that I am the 
EXO.14.19	Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel’s army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them, 
EXO.14.20	coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.
EXO.14.21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the 
EXO.14.22	and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
EXO.14.23	The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea. 
EXO.14.24	During the last watch of the night the 
EXO.14.25	He jammed
EXO.14.26	Then the 
EXO.14.27	Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward
EXO.14.28	The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
EXO.14.29	But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. 
EXO.14.30	That day the 
EXO.14.31	And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the 
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the 
EXO.15.1	“I will sing to the 
EXO.15.1	for he is highly exalted.
EXO.15.1	Both horse and driver
EXO.15.1	he has hurled into the sea.
EXO.15.2	“The 
EXO.15.2	he has become my salvation.
EXO.15.2	He is my God, and I will praise him,
EXO.15.2	my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.3	the 
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh’s chariots and his army
EXO.15.4	he has hurled into the sea.
EXO.15.4	The best of Pharaoh’s officers
EXO.15.4	are drowned in the Red Sea.
EXO.15.5	The deep waters have covered them;
EXO.15.5	they sank to the depths like a stone.
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, 
EXO.15.6	was majestic in power.
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, 
EXO.15.6	shattered the enemy.
EXO.15.7	“In the greatness of your majesty
EXO.15.7	you threw down those who opposed you.
EXO.15.7	You unleashed your burning anger;
EXO.15.7	it consumed them like stubble.
EXO.15.8	By the blast of your nostrils
EXO.15.8	the waters piled up.
EXO.15.8	The surging waters stood up like a wall;
EXO.15.8	the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.
EXO.15.9	The enemy boasted,
EXO.15.9	‘I will pursue, I will overtake them.
EXO.15.9	I will divide the spoils;
EXO.15.9	I will gorge myself on them.
EXO.15.9	I will draw my sword
EXO.15.9	and my hand will destroy them.’
EXO.15.10	But you blew with your breath,
EXO.15.10	and the sea covered them.
EXO.15.10	They sank like lead
EXO.15.10	in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	Who among the gods
EXO.15.11	is like you, 
EXO.15.11	Who is like you—
EXO.15.11	majestic in holiness,
EXO.15.11	awesome in glory,
EXO.15.11	working wonders?
EXO.15.12	“You stretch out your right hand,
EXO.15.12	and the earth swallows your enemies.
EXO.15.13	In your unfailing love you will lead
EXO.15.13	the people you have redeemed.
EXO.15.13	In your strength you will guide them
EXO.15.13	to your holy dwelling.
EXO.15.14	The nations will hear and tremble;
EXO.15.14	anguish will grip the people of Philistia.
EXO.15.15	The chiefs of Edom will be terrified,
EXO.15.15	the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling,
EXO.15.15	the people
EXO.15.16	terror and dread will fall on them.
EXO.15.16	By the power of your arm
EXO.15.16	they will be as still as a stone—
EXO.15.16	until your people pass by, 
EXO.15.16	until the people you bought
EXO.15.17	You will bring them in and plant them
EXO.15.17	on the mountain of your inheritance—
EXO.15.17	the place, 
EXO.15.17	the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established.
EXO.15.18	“The 
EXO.15.18	for ever and ever.”
EXO.15.19	When Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and horsemen
EXO.15.20	Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her, with timbrels and dancing. 
EXO.15.21	Miriam sang to them:
EXO.15.21	“Sing to the 
EXO.15.21	for he is highly exalted.
EXO.15.21	Both horse and driver
EXO.15.21	he has hurled into the sea.”
EXO.15.22	Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water. 
EXO.15.23	When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah.
EXO.15.24	So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?”
EXO.15.25	Then Moses cried out to the 
EXO.15.25	There the 
EXO.15.26	He said, “If you listen carefully to the 
EXO.15.27	Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water.
EXO.16.1	The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt. 
EXO.16.2	In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. 
EXO.16.3	The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the 
EXO.16.4	Then the 
EXO.16.5	On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.”
EXO.16.6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that it was the 
EXO.16.7	and in the morning you will see the glory of the 
EXO.16.8	Moses also said, “You will know that it was the 
EXO.16.9	Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the 
EXO.16.10	While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the 
EXO.16.11	The 
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the 
EXO.16.13	That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. 
EXO.16.14	When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor. 
EXO.16.15	When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was.
EXO.16.15	Moses said to them, “It is the bread the 
EXO.16.16	This is what the 
EXO.16.17	The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little. 
EXO.16.18	And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.
EXO.16.19	Then Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.”
EXO.16.20	However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.
EXO.16.21	Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away. 
EXO.16.22	On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much—two omers
EXO.16.23	He said to them, “This is what the 
EXO.16.24	So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it. 
EXO.16.25	“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a sabbath to the 
EXO.16.26	Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.”
EXO.16.27	Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none. 
EXO.16.28	Then the 
EXO.16.29	Bear in mind that the 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	The people of Israel called the bread manna.
EXO.16.32	Moses said, “This is what the 
EXO.16.33	So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the 
EXO.16.34	As the 
EXO.16.35	The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.
EXO.16.36	(An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.)
EXO.17.1	The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the 
EXO.17.2	So they quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.”
EXO.17.2	Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the 
EXO.17.3	But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?”
EXO.17.4	Then Moses cried out to the 
EXO.17.5	The 
EXO.17.6	I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
EXO.17.7	And he called the place Massah
EXO.17.8	The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. 
EXO.17.9	Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.”
EXO.17.10	So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. 
EXO.17.12	When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset. 
EXO.17.13	So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.
EXO.17.14	Then the 
EXO.17.15	Moses built an altar and called it The 
EXO.17.16	He said, “Because hands were lifted up against
EXO.18.1	Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the 
EXO.18.2	After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her 
EXO.18.3	and her two sons. One son was named Gershom,
EXO.18.4	and the other was named Eliezer,
EXO.18.5	Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, together with Moses’ sons and wife, came to him in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain of God. 
EXO.18.6	Jethro had sent word to him, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”
EXO.18.7	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent. 
EXO.18.8	Moses told his father-in-law about everything the 
EXO.18.9	Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the 
EXO.18.10	He said, “Praise be to the 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the 
EXO.18.12	Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.
EXO.18.13	The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening. 
EXO.18.14	When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, “What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?”
EXO.18.15	Moses answered him, “Because the people come to me to seek God’s will. 
EXO.18.16	Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God’s decrees and instructions.”
EXO.18.17	Moses’ father-in-law replied, “What you are doing is not good. 
EXO.18.18	You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone. 
EXO.18.19	Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their disputes to him. 
EXO.18.20	Teach them his decrees and instructions, and show them the way they are to live and how they are to behave. 
EXO.18.21	But select capable men from all the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 
EXO.18.22	Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you. 
EXO.18.23	If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.”
EXO.18.24	Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 
EXO.18.25	He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 
EXO.18.26	They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.
EXO.18.27	Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country.
EXO.19.1	On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt—on that very day—they came to the Desert of Sinai. 
EXO.19.2	After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.
EXO.19.3	Then Moses went up to God, and the 
EXO.19.4	‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. 
EXO.19.5	Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,

EXO.19.12	Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death. 
EXO.19.13	They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.’ Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.”
EXO.19.14	After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. 
EXO.19.15	Then he said to the people, “Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.”
EXO.19.16	On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled. 
EXO.19.17	Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.19.18	Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the 
EXO.19.19	As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.
EXO.19.20	The 
EXO.19.21	and the 
EXO.19.22	Even the priests, who approach the 
EXO.19.23	Moses said to the 
EXO.19.24	The 
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down to the people and told them.
EXO.20.1	And God spoke all these words:

EXO.20.3	“You shall have no other gods before
EXO.20.4	“You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.

EXO.20.16	“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
EXO.20.17	“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
EXO.20.18	When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance 
EXO.20.19	and said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.”
EXO.20.20	Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.”
EXO.20.21	The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
EXO.20.22	Then the 
EXO.20.23	Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.

EXO.20.25	If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it. 
EXO.20.26	And do not go up to my altar on steps, or your private parts may be exposed.’
EXO.21.1	“These are the laws you are to set before them:
EXO.21.2	“If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything. 
EXO.21.3	If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him. 
EXO.21.4	If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free.
EXO.21.5	“But if the servant declares, ‘I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,’ 
EXO.21.6	then his master must take him before the judges.
EXO.21.7	“If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do. 
EXO.21.8	If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself,
EXO.21.9	If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter. 
EXO.21.10	If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights. 
EXO.21.11	If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money.
EXO.21.12	“Anyone who strikes a person with a fatal blow is to be put to death. 
EXO.21.13	However, if it is not done intentionally, but God lets it happen, they are to flee to a place I will designate. 
EXO.21.14	But if anyone schemes and kills someone deliberately, that person is to be taken from my altar and put to death.

EXO.21.18	“If people quarrel and one person hits another with a stone or with their fist
EXO.21.19	the one who struck the blow will not be held liable if the other can get up and walk around outside with a staff; however, the guilty party must pay the injured person for any loss of time and see that the victim is completely healed.
EXO.21.20	“Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, 
EXO.21.21	but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.
EXO.21.22	“If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely

EXO.21.28	“If a bull gores a man or woman to death, the bull is to be stoned to death, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the bull will not be held responsible. 
EXO.21.29	If, however, the bull has had the habit of goring and the owner has been warned but has not kept it penned up and it kills a man or woman, the bull is to be stoned and its owner also is to be put to death. 
EXO.21.30	However, if payment is demanded, the owner may redeem his life by the payment of whatever is demanded. 
EXO.21.31	This law also applies if the bull gores a son or daughter. 
EXO.21.32	If the bull gores a male or female slave, the owner must pay thirty shekels

EXO.21.34	the one who opened the pit must pay the owner for the loss and take the dead animal in exchange.
EXO.21.35	“If anyone’s bull injures someone else’s bull and it dies, the two parties are to sell the live one and divide both the money and the dead animal equally. 
EXO.21.36	However, if it was known that the bull had the habit of goring, yet the owner did not keep it penned up, the owner must pay, animal for animal, and take the dead animal in exchange.

EXO.22.2	“If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed; 
EXO.22.3	but if it happens after sunrise, the defender is guilty of bloodshed.

EXO.22.6	“If a fire breaks out and spreads into thornbushes so that it burns shocks of grain or standing grain or the whole field, the one who started the fire must make restitution.
EXO.22.7	“If anyone gives a neighbor silver or goods for safekeeping and they are stolen from the neighbor’s house, the thief, if caught, must pay back double. 
EXO.22.8	But if the thief is not found, the owner of the house must appear before the judges, and they must

EXO.22.11	the issue between them will be settled by the taking of an oath before the

EXO.22.13	If it was torn to pieces by a wild animal, the neighbor shall bring in the remains as evidence and shall not be required to pay for the torn animal.
EXO.22.14	“If anyone borrows an animal from their neighbor and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present, they must make restitution. 
EXO.22.15	But if the owner is with the animal, the borrower will not have to pay. If the animal was hired, the money paid for the hire covers the loss.
EXO.22.16	“If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife. 
EXO.22.17	If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the bride-price for virgins.

EXO.22.22	“Do not take advantage of the widow or the fatherless. 
EXO.22.23	If you do and they cry out to me, I will certainly hear their cry. 
EXO.22.24	My anger will be aroused, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives will become widows and your children fatherless.
EXO.22.25	“If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not treat it like a business deal; charge no interest. 
EXO.22.26	If you take your neighbor’s cloak as a pledge, return it by sunset, 
EXO.22.27	because that cloak is the only covering your neighbor has. What else can they sleep in? When they cry out to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.

EXO.23.1	“Do not spread false reports. Do not help a guilty person by being a malicious witness.
EXO.23.2	“Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you give testimony in a lawsuit, do not pervert justice by siding with the crowd,

EXO.23.6	“Do not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits. 
EXO.23.7	Have nothing to do with a false charge and do not put an innocent or honest person to death, for I will not acquit the guilty.
EXO.23.8	“Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the innocent.
EXO.23.9	“Do not oppress a foreigner; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt.
EXO.23.10	“For six years you are to sow your fields and harvest the crops, 
EXO.23.11	but during the seventh year let the land lie unplowed and unused. Then the poor among your people may get food from it, and the wild animals may eat what is left. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.
EXO.23.12	“Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work, so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and so that the slave born in your household and the foreigner living among you may be refreshed.

EXO.23.22	If you listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you. 
EXO.23.23	My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out.

EXO.23.28	I will send the hornet ahead of you to drive the Hivites, Canaanites and Hittites out of your way. 
EXO.23.29	But I will not drive them out in a single year, because the land would become desolate and the wild animals too numerous for you. 
EXO.23.30	Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you have increased enough to take possession of the land.
EXO.23.31	“I will establish your borders from the Red Sea
EXO.23.32	Do not make a covenant with them or with their gods.

EXO.24.10	and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of lapis lazuli, as bright blue as the sky.

EXO.27.4	Make a grating for it, a bronze network, and make a bronze ring at each of the four corners of the network.

EXO.31.1	Then the 
EXO.31.2	“See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 
EXO.31.3	and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills— 
EXO.31.4	to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, 
EXO.31.5	to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts. 
EXO.31.6	Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given ability to all the skilled workers to make everything I have commanded you: 
EXO.31.7	the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent— 
EXO.31.8	the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense,

EXO.31.15	For six days work is to be done, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, holy to the 
EXO.31.16	The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant. 
EXO.31.17	It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the 
EXO.31.18	When the 
EXO.32.1	When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods
EXO.32.2	Aaron answered them, “Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.” 
EXO.32.3	So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron. 
EXO.32.4	He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, “These are your gods,
EXO.32.5	When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival to the 
EXO.32.6	So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.
EXO.32.7	Then the 
EXO.32.8	They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’
EXO.32.9	“I have seen these people,” the 
EXO.32.10	Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”
EXO.32.11	But Moses sought the favor of the 
EXO.32.12	Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people. 
EXO.32.13	Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’ ” 
EXO.32.14	Then the 
EXO.32.15	Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back. 
EXO.32.16	The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
EXO.32.17	When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of war in the camp.”
EXO.32.18	Moses replied:
EXO.32.18	“It is not the sound of victory,
EXO.32.18	it is not the sound of defeat;
EXO.32.18	it is the sound of singing that I hear.”
EXO.32.19	When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.32.20	And he took the calf the people had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.
EXO.32.21	He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?”
EXO.32.22	“Do not be angry, my lord,” Aaron answered. “You know how prone these people are to evil. 
EXO.32.23	They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.’ 
EXO.32.24	So I told them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.’ Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”
EXO.32.25	Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies. 
EXO.32.26	So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the 
EXO.32.27	Then he said to them, “This is what the 
EXO.32.28	The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died. 
EXO.32.29	Then Moses said, “You have been set apart to the 
EXO.32.30	The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the 
EXO.32.31	So Moses went back to the 
EXO.32.32	But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.”
EXO.32.33	The 
EXO.32.34	Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.”
EXO.32.35	And the 
EXO.33.1	Then the 
EXO.33.2	I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
EXO.33.3	Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way.”
EXO.33.4	When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments. 
EXO.33.5	For the 
EXO.33.6	So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.
EXO.33.7	Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the “tent of meeting.” Anyone inquiring of the 
EXO.33.8	And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent. 
EXO.33.9	As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the 
EXO.33.10	Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to their tent. 
EXO.33.11	The 
EXO.33.12	Moses said to the 
EXO.33.13	If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people.”
EXO.33.14	The 
EXO.33.15	Then Moses said to him, “If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here. 
EXO.33.16	How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?”
EXO.33.17	And the 
EXO.33.18	Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.”
EXO.33.19	And the 
EXO.33.20	But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.”
EXO.33.21	Then the 
EXO.33.22	When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. 
EXO.33.23	Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen.”
EXO.34.1	The 
EXO.34.2	Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain. 
EXO.34.3	No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain.”
EXO.34.4	So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the 
EXO.34.5	Then the 
EXO.34.6	And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The 
EXO.34.7	maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”
EXO.34.8	Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped. 
EXO.34.9	“Lord,” he said, “if I have found favor in your eyes, then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance.”
EXO.34.10	Then the 
EXO.34.11	Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
EXO.34.12	Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you. 
EXO.34.13	Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles.
EXO.34.14	Do not worship any other god, for the 
EXO.34.15	“Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices. 
EXO.34.16	And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same.
EXO.34.17	“Do not make any idols.
EXO.34.18	“Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt.
EXO.34.19	“The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock. 
EXO.34.20	Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons.
EXO.34.20	“No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
EXO.34.21	“Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.
EXO.34.22	“Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
EXO.34.23	Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign

EXO.34.27	Then the 
EXO.34.28	Moses was there with the 
EXO.34.29	When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the 
EXO.34.30	When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him. 
EXO.34.31	But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them. 
EXO.34.32	Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the 
EXO.34.33	When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face. 
EXO.34.34	But whenever he entered the 
EXO.34.35	they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the 
EXO.35.1	Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, “These are the things the 
EXO.35.2	For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of sabbath rest to the 
EXO.35.3	Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”
EXO.35.4	Moses said to the whole Israelite community, “This is what the 
EXO.35.5	From what you have, take an offering for the 
EXO.35.6	blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair; 
EXO.35.7	ram skins dyed red and another type of durable leather
EXO.35.8	olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense; 
EXO.35.9	and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
EXO.35.10	“All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the 
EXO.35.11	the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases; 
EXO.35.12	the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it; 
EXO.35.13	the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence; 
EXO.35.14	the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps and oil for the light; 
EXO.35.15	the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle; 
EXO.35.16	the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin with its stand; 
EXO.35.17	the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; 
EXO.35.18	the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes; 
EXO.35.19	the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary—both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests.”
EXO.35.20	Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses’ presence, 
EXO.35.21	and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved them came and brought an offering to the 
EXO.35.22	All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the 
EXO.35.23	Everyone who had blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or the other durable leather brought them. 
EXO.35.24	Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the 
EXO.35.25	Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun—blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen. 
EXO.35.26	And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair. 
EXO.35.27	The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece. 
EXO.35.28	They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. 
EXO.35.29	All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the 
EXO.35.30	Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the 
EXO.35.31	and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills— 
EXO.35.32	to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, 
EXO.35.33	to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts. 
EXO.35.34	And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others. 
EXO.35.35	He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers—all of them skilled workers and designers.
EXO.36.1	So Bezalel, Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the 
EXO.36.2	Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the 
EXO.36.3	They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning. 
EXO.36.4	So all the skilled workers who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left what they were doing 
EXO.36.5	and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the 
EXO.36.6	Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp: “No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” And so the people were restrained from bringing more, 
EXO.36.7	because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work.
EXO.36.8	All those who were skilled among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by expert hands. 
EXO.36.9	All the curtains were the same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.
EXO.36.10	They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five. 
EXO.36.11	Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set. 
EXO.36.12	They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other. 
EXO.36.13	Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit.
EXO.36.14	They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven altogether. 
EXO.36.15	All eleven curtains were the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
EXO.36.16	They joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set. 
EXO.36.17	Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set. 
EXO.36.18	They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit. 
EXO.36.19	Then they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of the other durable leather.
EXO.36.20	They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle. 
EXO.36.21	Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,
EXO.36.22	with two projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way. 
EXO.36.23	They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle 
EXO.36.24	and made forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame, one under each projection. 
EXO.36.25	For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames 
EXO.36.26	and forty silver bases—two under each frame. 
EXO.36.27	They made six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle, 
EXO.36.28	and two frames were made for the corners of the tabernacle at the far end. 
EXO.36.29	At these two corners the frames were double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike. 
EXO.36.30	So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.
EXO.36.31	They also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle, 
EXO.36.32	five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle. 
EXO.36.33	They made the center crossbar so that it extended from end to end at the middle of the frames. 
EXO.36.34	They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
EXO.36.35	They made the curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker. 
EXO.36.36	They made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold. They made gold hooks for them and cast their four silver bases. 
EXO.36.37	For the entrance to the tent they made a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer; 
EXO.36.38	and they made five posts with hooks for them. They overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold and made their five bases of bronze.
EXO.37.1	Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood—two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
EXO.37.2	He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it. 
EXO.37.3	He cast four gold rings for it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other. 
EXO.37.4	Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.5	And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.
EXO.37.6	He made the atonement cover of pure gold—two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 
EXO.37.7	Then he made two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover. 
EXO.37.8	He made one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; at the two ends he made them of one piece with the cover. 
EXO.37.9	The cherubim had their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the cover.
EXO.37.10	They
EXO.37.11	Then they overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it. 
EXO.37.12	They also made around it a rim a handbreadth
EXO.37.13	They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners, where the four legs were. 
EXO.37.14	The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table. 
EXO.37.15	The poles for carrying the table were made of acacia wood and were overlaid with gold. 
EXO.37.16	And they made from pure gold the articles for the table—its plates and dishes and bowls and its pitchers for the pouring out of drink offerings.
EXO.37.17	They made the lampstand of pure gold. They hammered out its base and shaft, and made its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms of one piece with them. 
EXO.37.18	Six branches extended from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other. 
EXO.37.19	Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on one branch, three on the next branch and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand. 
EXO.37.20	And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms. 
EXO.37.21	One bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair—six branches in all. 
EXO.37.22	The buds and the branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.
EXO.37.23	They made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold. 
EXO.37.24	They made the lampstand and all its accessories from one talent
EXO.37.25	They made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long and a cubit wide and two cubits high
EXO.37.26	They overlaid the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it. 
EXO.37.27	They made two gold rings below the molding—two on each of the opposite sides—to hold the poles used to carry it. 
EXO.37.28	They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
EXO.37.29	They also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense—the work of a perfumer.
EXO.38.1	They
EXO.38.2	They made a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar were of one piece, and they overlaid the altar with bronze. 
EXO.38.3	They made all its utensils of bronze—its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans. 
EXO.38.4	They made a grating for the altar, a bronze network, to be under its ledge, halfway up the altar. 
EXO.38.5	They cast bronze rings to hold the poles for the four corners of the bronze grating. 
EXO.38.6	They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 
EXO.38.7	They inserted the poles into the rings so they would be on the sides of the altar for carrying it. They made it hollow, out of boards.
EXO.38.8	They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
EXO.38.9	Next they made the courtyard. The south side was a hundred cubits
EXO.38.10	with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts. 
EXO.38.11	The north side was also a hundred cubits long and had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
EXO.38.12	The west end was fifty cubits
EXO.38.13	The east end, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits wide. 
EXO.38.14	Curtains fifteen cubits
EXO.38.15	and curtains fifteen cubits long were on the other side of the entrance to the courtyard, with three posts and three bases. 
EXO.38.16	All the curtains around the courtyard were of finely twisted linen. 
EXO.38.17	The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver; so all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands.
EXO.38.18	The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was made of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer. It was twenty cubits
EXO.38.19	with four posts and four bronze bases. Their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver. 
EXO.38.20	All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the surrounding courtyard were bronze.
EXO.38.21	These are the amounts of the materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant law, which were recorded at Moses’ command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest. 
EXO.38.22	(Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the 
EXO.38.23	with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan—an engraver and designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.) 
EXO.38.24	The total amount of the gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary was 29 talents and 730 shekels,
EXO.38.25	The silver obtained from those of the community who were counted in the census was 100 talents
EXO.38.26	one beka per person, that is, half a shekel,
EXO.38.27	The 100 talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain—100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent for each base. 
EXO.38.28	They used the 1,775 shekels to make the hooks for the posts, to overlay the tops of the posts, and to make their bands.
EXO.38.29	The bronze from the wave offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.
EXO.38.30	They used it to make the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze grating and all its utensils, 
EXO.38.31	the bases for the surrounding courtyard and those for its entrance and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and those for the surrounding courtyard.
EXO.39.1	From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They also made sacred garments for Aaron, as the 
EXO.39.2	They
EXO.39.3	They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut strands to be worked into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen—the work of skilled hands. 
EXO.39.4	They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached to two of its corners, so it could be fastened. 
EXO.39.5	Its skillfully woven waistband was like it—of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen, as the 
EXO.39.6	They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel. 
EXO.39.7	Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the 
EXO.39.8	They fashioned the breastpiece—the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. 
EXO.39.9	It was square—a span
EXO.39.10	Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. The first row was carnelian, chrysolite and beryl; 
EXO.39.11	the second row was turquoise, lapis lazuli and emerald; 
EXO.39.12	the third row was jacinth, agate and amethyst; 
EXO.39.13	the fourth row was topaz, onyx and jasper.
EXO.39.14	There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.
EXO.39.15	For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope. 
EXO.39.16	They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece. 
EXO.39.17	They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece, 
EXO.39.18	and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front. 
EXO.39.19	They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod. 
EXO.39.20	Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod. 
EXO.39.21	They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod—as the 
EXO.39.22	They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth—the work of a weaver— 
EXO.39.23	with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar,
EXO.39.24	They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe. 
EXO.39.25	And they made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates. 
EXO.39.26	The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the 
EXO.39.27	For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen—the work of a weaver— 
EXO.39.28	and the turban of fine linen, the linen caps and the undergarments of finely twisted linen. 
EXO.39.29	The sash was made of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn—the work of an embroiderer—as the 
EXO.39.30	They made the plate, the sacred emblem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: 
EXO.39.31	Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the 
EXO.39.32	So all the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the 
EXO.39.33	Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases; 
EXO.39.34	the covering of ram skins dyed red and the covering of another durable leather
EXO.39.35	the ark of the covenant law with its poles and the atonement cover; 
EXO.39.36	the table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence; 
EXO.39.37	the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its accessories, and the olive oil for the light; 
EXO.39.38	the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent; 
EXO.39.39	the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin with its stand; 
EXO.39.40	the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; all the furnishings for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting; 
EXO.39.41	and the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests.
EXO.39.42	The Israelites had done all the work just as the 
EXO.39.43	Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the 
EXO.40.1	Then the 
EXO.40.2	“Set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, on the first day of the first month. 
EXO.40.3	Place the ark of the covenant law in it and shield the ark with the curtain. 
EXO.40.4	Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps. 
EXO.40.5	Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the covenant law and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
EXO.40.6	“Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting; 
EXO.40.7	place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it. 
EXO.40.8	Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.
EXO.40.9	“Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy. 
EXO.40.10	Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy. 
EXO.40.11	Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.
EXO.40.12	“Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water. 
EXO.40.13	Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest. 
EXO.40.14	Bring his sons and dress them in tunics. 
EXO.40.15	Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue throughout their generations.” 
EXO.40.16	Moses did everything just as the 
EXO.40.17	So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year. 
EXO.40.18	When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts. 
EXO.40.19	Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the 
EXO.40.20	He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it. 
EXO.40.21	Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the covenant law, as the 
EXO.40.22	Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain 
EXO.40.23	and set out the bread on it before the 
EXO.40.24	He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle 
EXO.40.25	and set up the lamps before the 
EXO.40.26	Moses placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain 
EXO.40.27	and burned fragrant incense on it, as the 
EXO.40.28	Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. 
EXO.40.29	He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the 
EXO.40.30	He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing, 
EXO.40.31	and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet. 
EXO.40.32	They washed whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, as the 
EXO.40.33	Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.
EXO.40.34	Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.35	Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.36	In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out; 
EXO.40.37	but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out—until the day it lifted. 
EXO.40.38	So the cloud of the

LEV.8.15	Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it. 
LEV.8.16	Moses also took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar. 
LEV.8.17	But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its intestines he burned up outside the camp, as the

LEV.8.20	He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat. 
LEV.8.21	He washed the internal organs and the legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the 
LEV.8.22	He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. 
LEV.8.23	Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. 
LEV.8.24	Moses also brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he splashed blood against the sides of the altar. 
LEV.8.25	After that, he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh.

LEV.9.9	His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar. 
LEV.9.10	On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the 
LEV.9.11	the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp.
LEV.9.12	Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. 
LEV.9.13	They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar. 
LEV.9.14	He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
LEV.9.15	Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the people’s sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one.
LEV.9.16	He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way. 
LEV.9.17	He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering.
LEV.9.18	He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. 
LEV.9.19	But the fat portions of the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver— 
LEV.9.20	these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar. 
LEV.9.21	Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the 
LEV.9.22	Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down.
LEV.9.23	Moses and Aaron then went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the 
LEV.9.24	Fire came out from the presence of the 
LEV.10.1	Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the 
LEV.10.2	So fire came out from the presence of the

LEV.10.3	“ ‘Among those who approach me

LEV.10.3	Aaron remained silent.
LEV.10.4	Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary.” 
LEV.10.5	So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered.

LEV.10.13	Eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is your share and your sons’ share of the food offerings presented to the 
LEV.10.14	But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites’ fellowship offerings. 
LEV.10.15	The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the food offerings, to be waved before the 
LEV.10.16	When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering
LEV.10.17	“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the 
LEV.10.18	Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.”

LEV.13.43	The priest is to examine him, and if the swollen sore on his head or forehead is reddish-white like a defiling skin disease, 
LEV.13.44	the man is diseased and is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean because of the sore on his head.

LEV.13.51	On the seventh day he is to examine it, and if the mold has spread in the fabric, the woven or knitted material, or the leather, whatever its use, it is a persistent defiling mold; the article is unclean. 
LEV.13.52	He must burn the fabric, the woven or knitted material of wool or linen, or any leather article that has been spoiled; because the defiling mold is persistent, the article must be burned.
LEV.13.53	“But if, when the priest examines it, the mold has not spread in the fabric, the woven or knitted material, or the leather article, 
LEV.13.54	he shall order that the spoiled article be washed. Then he is to isolate it for another seven days. 
LEV.13.55	After the article has been washed, the priest is to examine it again, and if the mold has not changed its appearance, even though it has not spread, it is unclean. Burn it, no matter which side of the fabric has been spoiled.

LEV.25.4	But in the seventh year the land is to have a year of sabbath rest, a sabbath to the 
LEV.25.5	Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest. 
LEV.25.6	Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you—for yourself, your male and female servants, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you, 
LEV.25.7	as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.
LEV.25.8	“ ‘Count off seven sabbath years—seven times seven years—so that the seven sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years. 
LEV.25.9	Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land. 
LEV.25.10	Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each of you is to return to your family property and to your own clan. 
LEV.25.11	The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines. 
LEV.25.12	For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.
LEV.25.13	“ ‘In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property.
LEV.25.14	“ ‘If you sell land to any of your own people or buy land from them, do not take advantage of each other. 
LEV.25.15	You are to buy from your own people on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And they are to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops. 
LEV.25.16	When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops. 
LEV.25.17	Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the 
LEV.25.18	“ ‘Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land. 
LEV.25.19	Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety. 
LEV.25.20	You may ask, “What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?” 
LEV.25.21	I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years. 
LEV.25.22	While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.
LEV.25.23	“ ‘The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers. 
LEV.25.24	Throughout the land that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
LEV.25.25	“ ‘If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem what they have sold. 
LEV.25.26	If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves, 
LEV.25.27	they are to determine the value for the years since they sold it and refund the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then go back to their own property. 
LEV.25.28	But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and they can then go back to their property.
LEV.25.29	“ ‘Anyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time the seller may redeem it. 
LEV.25.30	If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer’s descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee. 
LEV.25.31	But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.
LEV.25.32	“ ‘The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess. 
LEV.25.33	So the property of the Levites is redeemable—that is, a house sold in any town they hold—and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites. 
LEV.25.34	But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.
LEV.25.35	“ ‘If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you. 
LEV.25.36	Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you. 
LEV.25.37	You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit. 
LEV.25.38	I am the

LEV.25.40	They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee. 
LEV.25.41	Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors. 
LEV.25.42	Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves. 
LEV.25.43	Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God.
LEV.25.44	“ ‘Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. 
LEV.25.45	You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. 
LEV.25.46	You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.
LEV.25.47	“ ‘If a foreigner residing among you becomes rich and any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to the foreigner or to a member of the foreigner’s clan, 
LEV.25.48	they retain the right of redemption after they have sold themselves. One of their relatives may redeem them: 
LEV.25.49	An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in their clan may redeem them. Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves. 
LEV.25.50	They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years. 
LEV.25.51	If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share of the price paid for them. 
LEV.25.52	If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly. 
LEV.25.53	They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them ruthlessly.
LEV.25.54	“ ‘Even if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee, 
LEV.25.55	for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the

LEV.26.4	I will send you rain in its season, and the ground will yield its crops and the trees their fruit. 
LEV.26.5	Your threshing will continue until grape harvest and the grape harvest will continue until planting, and you will eat all the food you want and live in safety in your land.
LEV.26.6	“ ‘I will grant peace in the land, and you will lie down and no one will make you afraid. I will remove wild beasts from the land, and the sword will not pass through your country. 
LEV.26.7	You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you. 
LEV.26.8	Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall by the sword before you.

LEV.26.10	You will still be eating last year’s harvest when you will have to move it out to make room for the new.

LEV.26.15	and if you reject my decrees and abhor my laws and fail to carry out all my commands and so violate my covenant, 
LEV.26.16	then I will do this to you: I will bring on you sudden terror, wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and sap your strength. You will plant seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it. 
LEV.26.17	I will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you.
LEV.26.18	“ ‘If after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for your sins seven times over. 
LEV.26.19	I will break down your stubborn pride and make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze. 
LEV.26.20	Your strength will be spent in vain, because your soil will not yield its crops, nor will the trees of your land yield their fruit.
LEV.26.21	“ ‘If you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me, I will multiply your afflictions seven times over, as your sins deserve. 
LEV.26.22	I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children, destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads will be deserted.
LEV.26.23	“ ‘If in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue to be hostile toward me, 
LEV.26.24	I myself will be hostile toward you and will afflict you for your sins seven times over. 
LEV.26.25	And I will bring the sword on you to avenge the breaking of the covenant. When you withdraw into your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be given into enemy hands. 
LEV.26.26	When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven, and they will dole out the bread by weight. You will eat, but you will not be satisfied.
LEV.26.27	“ ‘If in spite of this you still do not listen to me but continue to be hostile toward me, 
LEV.26.28	then in my anger I will be hostile toward you, and I myself will punish you for your sins seven times over. 
LEV.26.29	You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters. 
LEV.26.30	I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars and pile your dead bodies
LEV.26.31	I will turn your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries, and I will take no delight in the pleasing aroma of your offerings. 
LEV.26.32	I myself will lay waste the land, so that your enemies who live there will be appalled. 
LEV.26.33	I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out my sword and pursue you. Your land will be laid waste, and your cities will lie in ruins. 
LEV.26.34	Then the land will enjoy its sabbath years all the time that it lies desolate and you are in the country of your enemies; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths. 
LEV.26.35	All the time that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you lived in it.
LEV.26.36	“ ‘As for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight. They will run as though fleeing from the sword, and they will fall, even though no one is pursuing them.

LEV.26.38	You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will devour you. 
LEV.26.39	Those of you who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins; also because of their ancestors’ sins they will waste away.
LEV.26.40	“ ‘But if they will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors—their unfaithfulness and their hostility toward me, 
LEV.26.41	which made me hostile toward them so that I sent them into the land of their enemies—then when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin, 
LEV.26.42	I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. 
LEV.26.43	For the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them. They will pay for their sins because they rejected my laws and abhorred my decrees. 
LEV.26.44	Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or abhor them so as to destroy them completely, breaking my covenant with them. I am the

NUM.3.19	Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.

NUM.3.20	These were the Levite clans, according to their families.
NUM.3.21	To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were the Gershonite clans. 
NUM.3.22	The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500. 
NUM.3.23	The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle. 
NUM.3.24	The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael. 
NUM.3.25	At the tent of meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the tent of meeting,

NUM.3.31	They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and everything related to their use. 
NUM.3.32	The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
NUM.3.33	To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans. 
NUM.3.34	The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200. 
NUM.3.35	The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle. 
NUM.3.36	The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use, 
NUM.3.37	as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes.
NUM.3.38	Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the tent of meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.
NUM.3.39	The total number of Levites counted at the

NUM.3.49	So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number redeemed by the Levites. 
NUM.3.50	From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels,
NUM.3.51	Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the word of the

NUM.4.16	“Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its holy furnishings and articles.”

NUM.4.18	“See that the Kohathite tribal clans are not destroyed from among the Levites. 
NUM.4.19	So that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and his sons are to go into the sanctuary and assign to each man his work and what he is to carry. 
NUM.4.20	But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die.”
NUM.4.21	The 
NUM.4.22	“Take a census also of the Gershonites by their families and clans. 
NUM.4.23	Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.

NUM.4.34	Moses, Aaron and the leaders of the community counted the Kohathites by their clans and families. 
NUM.4.35	All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the tent of meeting, 
NUM.4.36	counted by clans, were 2,750. 
NUM.4.37	This was the total of all those in the Kohathite clans who served at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the 
NUM.4.38	The Gershonites were counted by their clans and families. 
NUM.4.39	All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the tent of meeting, 
NUM.4.40	counted by their clans and families, were 2,630. 
NUM.4.41	This was the total of those in the Gershonite clans who served at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the

NUM.4.43	All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the tent of meeting, 
NUM.4.44	counted by their clans, were 3,200. 
NUM.4.45	This was the total of those in the Merarite clans. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the

NUM.4.47	All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to do the work of serving and carrying the tent of meeting 
NUM.4.48	numbered 8,580. 
NUM.4.49	At the 
NUM.4.49	Thus they were counted, as the 
NUM.5.1	The 
NUM.5.2	“Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has a defiling skin disease
NUM.5.3	Send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.” 
NUM.5.4	The Israelites did so; they sent them outside the camp. They did just as the 
NUM.5.5	The 
NUM.5.6	“Say to the Israelites: ‘Any man or woman who wrongs another in any way
NUM.5.7	and must confess the sin they have committed. They must make full restitution for the wrong they have done, add a fifth of the value to it and give it all to the person they have wronged. 
NUM.5.8	But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the 
NUM.5.9	All the sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him. 
NUM.5.10	Sacred things belong to their owners, but what they give to the priest will belong to the priest.’ ”
NUM.5.11	Then the 
NUM.5.12	“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If a man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him 
NUM.5.13	so that another man has sexual relations with her, and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act), 
NUM.5.14	and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure—or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure— 
NUM.5.15	then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah
NUM.5.16	“ ‘The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the 
NUM.5.17	Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.

NUM.5.19	Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, “If no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you. 
NUM.5.20	But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband”— 
NUM.5.21	here the priest is to put the woman under this curse—“may the 
NUM.5.22	May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.”
NUM.5.22	“ ‘Then the woman is to say, “Amen. So be it.”
NUM.5.23	“ ‘The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water. 
NUM.5.24	He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her. 
NUM.5.25	The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the 
NUM.5.26	The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial
NUM.5.27	If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse. 
NUM.5.28	If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.
NUM.5.29	“ ‘This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and makes herself impure while married to her husband, 
NUM.5.30	or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her stand before the

NUM.6.1	The 
NUM.6.2	“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If a man or woman wants to make a special vow, a vow of dedication to the

NUM.6.10	Then on the eighth day they must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
NUM.6.11	The priest is to offer one as a sin offering
NUM.6.12	They must rededicate themselves to the 
NUM.6.13	“ ‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the period of their dedication is over. They are to be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
NUM.6.14	There they are to present their offerings to the 
NUM.6.15	together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket of bread made with the finest flour and without yeast—thick loaves with olive oil mixed in, and thin loaves brushed with olive oil.
NUM.6.16	“ ‘The priest is to present all these before the 
NUM.6.17	He is to present the basket of unleavened bread and is to sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to the 
NUM.6.18	“ ‘Then at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the Nazirite must shave off the hair that symbolizes their dedication. They are to take the hair and put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering.
NUM.6.19	“ ‘After the Nazirite has shaved off the hair that symbolizes their dedication, the priest is to place in their hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, and one thick loaf and one thin loaf from the basket, both made without yeast. 
NUM.6.20	The priest shall then wave these before the 
NUM.6.21	“ ‘This is the law of the Nazirite who vows offerings to the

NUM.6.26	and give you peace.” ’
NUM.6.27	“So they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.”
NUM.7.1	When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils. 
NUM.7.2	Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted, made offerings. 
NUM.7.3	They brought as their gifts before the 
NUM.7.4	The 
NUM.7.5	“Accept these from them, that they may be used in the work at the tent of meeting. Give them to the Levites as each man’s work requires.”
NUM.7.6	So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites. 
NUM.7.7	He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their work required, 
NUM.7.8	and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their work required. They were all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest. 
NUM.7.9	But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, because they were to carry on their shoulders the holy things, for which they were responsible.
NUM.7.10	When the altar was anointed, the leaders brought their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar.

NUM.8.3	Aaron did so; he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand, just as the 
NUM.8.4	This is how the lampstand was made: It was made of hammered gold—from its base to its blossoms. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the 
NUM.8.5	The 
NUM.8.6	“Take the Levites from among all the Israelites and make them ceremonially clean. 
NUM.8.7	To purify them, do this: Sprinkle the water of cleansing on them; then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. And so they will purify themselves. 
NUM.8.8	Have them take a young bull with its grain offering of the finest flour mixed with olive oil; then you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering.
NUM.8.9	Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting and assemble the whole Israelite community. 
NUM.8.10	You are to bring the Levites before the

NUM.8.15	“After you have purified the Levites and presented them as a wave offering, they are to come to do their work at the tent of meeting. 
NUM.8.16	They are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to me. I have taken them as my own in place of the firstborn, the first male offspring from every Israelite woman. 
NUM.8.17	Every firstborn male in Israel, whether human or animal, is mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself. 
NUM.8.18	And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons in Israel. 
NUM.8.19	From among all the Israelites, I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons to do the work at the tent of meeting on behalf of the Israelites and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the Israelites when they go near the sanctuary.”
NUM.8.20	Moses, Aaron and the whole Israelite community did with the Levites just as the 
NUM.8.21	The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the 
NUM.8.22	After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They did with the Levites just as the 
NUM.8.23	The 
NUM.8.24	“This applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years old or more shall come to take part in the work at the tent of meeting, 
NUM.8.25	but at the age of fifty, they must retire from their regular service and work no longer. 
NUM.8.26	They may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the tent of meeting, but they themselves must not do the work. This, then, is how you are to assign the responsibilities of the Levites.”

NUM.9.2	“Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover at the appointed time. 
NUM.9.3	Celebrate it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with all its rules and regulations.”
NUM.9.4	So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover, 
NUM.9.5	and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the 
NUM.9.6	But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day 
NUM.9.7	and said to Moses, “We have become unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be kept from presenting the

NUM.9.12	They must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones. When they celebrate the Passover, they must follow all the regulations.

NUM.9.16	That is how it continued to be; the cloud covered it, and at night it looked like fire. 
NUM.9.17	Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites encamped. 
NUM.9.18	At the 
NUM.9.19	When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time, the Israelites obeyed the 
NUM.9.20	Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days; at the 
NUM.9.21	Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out. 
NUM.9.22	Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out.

NUM.10.1	The 
NUM.10.2	“Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out. 
NUM.10.3	When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
NUM.10.4	If only one is sounded, the leaders—the heads of the clans of Israel—are to assemble before you. 
NUM.10.5	When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out. 
NUM.10.6	At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out. 
NUM.10.7	To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the signal for setting out.
NUM.10.8	“The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come. 
NUM.10.9	When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the

NUM.10.11	On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant law. 
NUM.10.12	Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran. 
NUM.10.13	They set out, this first time, at the 
NUM.10.14	The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command. 
NUM.10.15	Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar, 
NUM.10.16	and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun. 
NUM.10.17	Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out.
NUM.10.18	The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command. 
NUM.10.19	Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon, 
NUM.10.20	and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad. 
NUM.10.21	Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived.
NUM.10.22	The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command. 
NUM.10.23	Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh, 
NUM.10.24	and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
NUM.10.25	Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command. 
NUM.10.26	Pagiel son of Okran was over the division of the tribe of Asher, 
NUM.10.27	and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali. 
NUM.10.28	This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.
NUM.10.29	Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place about which the 
NUM.10.30	He answered, “No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people.”
NUM.10.31	But Moses said, “Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes. 
NUM.10.32	If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the 
NUM.10.33	So they set out from the mountain of the 
NUM.10.34	The cloud of the 
NUM.10.35	Whenever the ark set out, Moses said,
NUM.10.35	“Rise up, 
NUM.10.35	May your enemies be scattered;
NUM.10.35	may your foes flee before you.”
NUM.10.36	Whenever it came to rest, he said,
NUM.10.36	“Return, 
NUM.10.36	to the countless thousands of Israel.”
NUM.11.1	Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the 
NUM.11.2	When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the 
NUM.11.3	So that place was called Taberah,
NUM.11.4	The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, “If only we had meat to eat! 
NUM.11.5	We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic. 
NUM.11.6	But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!”
NUM.11.7	The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin. 
NUM.11.8	The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a hand mill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into loaves. And it tasted like something made with olive oil. 
NUM.11.9	When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down.
NUM.11.10	Moses heard the people of every family wailing at the entrance to their tents. The 
NUM.11.11	He asked the 
NUM.11.12	Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their ancestors? 
NUM.11.13	Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ 
NUM.11.14	I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me. 
NUM.11.15	If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me—if I have found favor in your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin.”
NUM.11.16	The 
NUM.11.17	I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone.
NUM.11.18	“Tell the people: ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The 
NUM.11.19	You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days, 
NUM.11.20	but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it—because you have rejected the 
NUM.11.21	But Moses said, “Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, ‘I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!’ 
NUM.11.22	Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?”
NUM.11.23	The 
NUM.11.24	So Moses went out and told the people what the 
NUM.11.25	Then the 
NUM.11.26	However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp. 
NUM.11.27	A young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
NUM.11.28	Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ aide since youth, spoke up and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!”
NUM.11.29	But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the 
NUM.11.30	Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
NUM.11.31	Now a wind went out from the 
NUM.11.32	All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers.
NUM.11.33	But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the 
NUM.11.34	Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah,
NUM.11.35	From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.
NUM.12.1	Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite. 
NUM.12.2	“Has the

NUM.12.4	At once the 
NUM.12.5	Then the 
NUM.12.6	he said, “Listen to my words:
NUM.12.6	“When there is a prophet among you,
NUM.12.6	I, the 
NUM.12.6	I speak to them in dreams.
NUM.12.7	But this is not true of my servant Moses;
NUM.12.7	he is faithful in all my house.
NUM.12.8	With him I speak face to face,
NUM.12.8	clearly and not in riddles;
NUM.12.8	he sees the form of the 
NUM.12.8	Why then were you not afraid
NUM.12.8	to speak against my servant Moses?”
NUM.12.9	The anger of the 
NUM.12.10	When the cloud lifted from above the tent, Miriam’s skin was leprous
NUM.12.11	and he said to Moses, “Please, my lord, I ask you not to hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed. 
NUM.12.12	Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother’s womb with its flesh half eaten away.”
NUM.12.13	So Moses cried out to the 
NUM.12.14	The 
NUM.12.15	So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back.
NUM.12.16	After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran.
NUM.13.1	The 
NUM.13.2	“Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders.”
NUM.13.3	So at the 
NUM.13.4	These are their names:
NUM.13.4	from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zakkur;
NUM.13.5	from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;
NUM.13.6	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
NUM.13.7	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;
NUM.13.8	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;
NUM.13.9	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;
NUM.13.10	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;
NUM.13.11	from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi;
NUM.13.12	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;
NUM.13.13	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;
NUM.13.14	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;
NUM.13.15	from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.
NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.)
NUM.13.17	When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, “Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country. 
NUM.13.18	See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many. 
NUM.13.19	What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified? 
NUM.13.20	How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)
NUM.13.21	So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath. 
NUM.13.22	They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
NUM.13.23	When they reached the Valley of Eshkol,
NUM.13.24	That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there. 
NUM.13.25	At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.
NUM.13.26	They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land. 
NUM.13.27	They gave Moses this account: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit. 
NUM.13.28	But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there. 
NUM.13.29	The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.”
NUM.13.30	Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.”
NUM.13.31	But the men who had gone up with him said, “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are.” 
NUM.13.32	And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, “The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size. 
NUM.13.33	We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.”
NUM.14.1	That night all the members of the community raised their voices and wept aloud. 
NUM.14.2	All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, “If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this wilderness! 
NUM.14.3	Why is the 
NUM.14.4	And they said to each other, “We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt.”
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there. 
NUM.14.6	Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes 
NUM.14.7	and said to the entire Israelite assembly, “The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good. 
NUM.14.8	If the 
NUM.14.9	Only do not rebel against the 
NUM.14.10	But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the 
NUM.14.11	The 
NUM.14.12	I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they.”
NUM.14.13	Moses said to the 
NUM.14.14	And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, 
NUM.14.15	If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say, 
NUM.14.16	‘The 
NUM.14.17	“Now may the Lord’s strength be displayed, just as you have declared: 
NUM.14.18	‘The 
NUM.14.19	In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now.”
NUM.14.20	The 
NUM.14.21	Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the 
NUM.14.22	not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times— 
NUM.14.23	not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it. 
NUM.14.24	But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it. 
NUM.14.25	Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.
NUM.14.26	The 
NUM.14.27	“How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites. 
NUM.14.28	So tell them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the 
NUM.14.29	In this wilderness your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me. 
NUM.14.30	Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 
NUM.14.31	As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected. 
NUM.14.32	But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness. 
NUM.14.33	Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness. 
NUM.14.34	For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.’ 
NUM.14.35	I, the 
NUM.14.36	So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it— 
NUM.14.37	these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the 
NUM.14.38	Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.
NUM.14.39	When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly. 
NUM.14.40	Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country, saying, “Now we are ready to go up to the land the 
NUM.14.41	But Moses said, “Why are you disobeying the 
NUM.14.42	Do not go up, because the 
NUM.14.43	for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the 
NUM.14.44	Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the highest point in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the

NUM.15.1	The 
NUM.15.2	“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘After you enter the land I am giving you as a home

NUM.16.9	Isn’t it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the 
NUM.16.10	He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too. 
NUM.16.11	It is against the 
NUM.16.12	Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, “We will not come! 
NUM.16.13	Isn’t it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? And now you also want to lord it over us! 
NUM.16.14	Moreover, you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you want to treat these men like slaves
NUM.16.15	Then Moses became very angry and said to the 
NUM.16.16	Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the 
NUM.16.17	Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it—250 censers in all—and present it before the 
NUM.16.18	So each of them took his censer, put burning coals and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
NUM.16.19	When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the 
NUM.16.20	The 
NUM.16.21	“Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.”
NUM.16.22	But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, “O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?”
NUM.16.23	Then the 
NUM.16.24	“Say to the assembly, ‘Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’ ”
NUM.16.25	Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. 
NUM.16.26	He warned the assembly, “Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.” 
NUM.16.27	So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.
NUM.16.28	Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that the 
NUM.16.29	If these men die a natural death and suffer the fate of all mankind, then the 
NUM.16.30	But if the 
NUM.16.31	As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart 
NUM.16.32	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all those associated with Korah, together with their possessions. 
NUM.16.33	They went down alive into the realm of the dead, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community. 
NUM.16.34	At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, “The earth is going to swallow us too!”
NUM.16.35	And fire came out from the 
NUM.16.36	The 
NUM.16.37	“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to remove the censers from the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy— 
NUM.16.38	the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the 
NUM.16.39	So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar, 
NUM.16.40	as the 
NUM.16.41	The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. “You have killed the 
NUM.16.42	But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the tent of meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the 
NUM.16.43	Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting, 
NUM.16.44	and the 
NUM.16.45	“Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.” And they fell facedown.
NUM.16.46	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put incense in it, along with burning coals from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the 
NUM.16.47	So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them. 
NUM.16.48	He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped. 
NUM.16.49	But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah. 
NUM.16.50	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for the plague had stopped.
NUM.17.1	The 
NUM.17.2	“Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff. 
NUM.17.3	On the staff of Levi write Aaron’s name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe. 
NUM.17.4	Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant law, where I meet with you. 
NUM.17.5	The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites.”
NUM.17.6	So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron’s staff was among them. 
NUM.17.7	Moses placed the staffs before the 
NUM.17.8	The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron’s staff, which represented the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds. 
NUM.17.9	Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the 
NUM.17.10	The 
NUM.17.11	Moses did just as the 
NUM.17.12	The Israelites said to Moses, “We will die! We are lost, we are all lost! 
NUM.17.13	Anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the 
NUM.18.1	The 
NUM.18.2	Bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the tent of the covenant law. 
NUM.18.3	They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the tent, but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar. Otherwise both they and you will die. 
NUM.18.4	They are to join you and be responsible for the care of the tent of meeting—all the work at the tent—and no one else may come near where you are.
NUM.18.5	“You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar, so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelites again. 
NUM.18.6	I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the 
NUM.18.7	But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain. I am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift. Anyone else who comes near the sanctuary is to be put to death.”
NUM.18.8	Then the 
NUM.18.9	You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings, whether grain or sin
NUM.18.10	Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. You must regard it as holy.
NUM.18.11	“This also is yours: whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I give this to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
NUM.18.12	“I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give the 
NUM.18.13	All the land’s firstfruits that they bring to the 
NUM.18.14	“Everything in Israel that is devoted
NUM.18.15	The first offspring of every womb, both human and animal, that is offered to the 
NUM.18.16	When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels
NUM.18.17	“But you must not redeem the firstborn of a cow, a sheep or a goat; they are holy. Splash their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the 
NUM.18.18	Their meat is to be yours, just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours. 
NUM.18.19	Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to the 
NUM.18.20	The 
NUM.18.21	“I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting. 
NUM.18.22	From now on the Israelites must not go near the tent of meeting, or they will bear the consequences of their sin and will die. 
NUM.18.23	It is the Levites who are to do the work at the tent of meeting and bear the responsibility for any offenses they commit against it. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. They will receive no inheritance among the Israelites. 
NUM.18.24	Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the 
NUM.18.25	The 
NUM.18.26	“Speak to the Levites and say to them: ‘When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must present a tenth of that tithe as the 
NUM.18.27	Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress. 
NUM.18.28	In this way you also will present an offering to the 
NUM.18.29	You must present as the 
NUM.18.30	“Say to the Levites: ‘When you present the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the product of the threshing floor or the winepress. 
NUM.18.31	You and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere, for it is your wages for your work at the tent of meeting. 
NUM.18.32	By presenting the best part of it you will not be guilty in this matter; then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites, and you will not die.’ ”
NUM.19.1	The 
NUM.19.2	“This is a requirement of the law that the 
NUM.19.3	Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence. 
NUM.19.4	Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting. 
NUM.19.5	While he watches, the heifer is to be burned—its hide, flesh, blood and intestines. 
NUM.19.6	The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer. 
NUM.19.7	After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening. 
NUM.19.8	The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he too will be unclean till evening.
NUM.19.9	“A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They are to be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing; it is for purification from sin. 
NUM.19.10	The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the foreigners residing among them.
NUM.19.11	“Whoever touches a human corpse will be unclean for seven days. 
NUM.19.12	They must purify themselves with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on the third and seventh days, they will not be clean. 
NUM.19.13	If they fail to purify themselves after touching a human corpse, they defile the 
NUM.19.14	“This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent: Anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days, 
NUM.19.15	and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean.
NUM.19.16	“Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days.
NUM.19.17	“For the unclean person, put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them. 
NUM.19.18	Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or anyone who has been killed or anyone who has died a natural death. 
NUM.19.19	The man who is clean is to sprinkle those who are unclean on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify them. Those who are being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and that evening they will be clean. 
NUM.19.20	But if those who are unclean do not purify themselves, they must be cut off from the community, because they have defiled the sanctuary of the 
NUM.19.21	This is a lasting ordinance for them.
NUM.19.21	“The man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening. 
NUM.19.22	Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who touches it becomes unclean till evening.”
NUM.20.1	In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried.
NUM.20.2	Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.20.3	They quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the 
NUM.20.4	Why did you bring the 
NUM.20.5	Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!”
NUM.20.6	Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the 
NUM.20.7	The 
NUM.20.8	“Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink.”
NUM.20.9	So Moses took the staff from the 
NUM.20.10	He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?” 
NUM.20.11	Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.
NUM.20.12	But the 
NUM.20.13	These were the waters of Meribah,
NUM.20.14	Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying:
NUM.20.14	“This is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships that have come on us. 
NUM.20.15	Our ancestors went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors, 
NUM.20.16	but when we cried out to the 
NUM.20.16	“Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory. 
NUM.20.17	Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.”
NUM.20.18	But Edom answered:
NUM.20.18	“You may not pass through here; if you try, we will march out and attack you with the sword.”
NUM.20.19	The Israelites replied:
NUM.20.19	“We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot—nothing else.”
NUM.20.20	Again they answered:
NUM.20.20	“You may not pass through.”
NUM.20.20	Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army. 
NUM.20.21	Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned away from them.
NUM.20.22	The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor. 
NUM.20.23	At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the 
NUM.20.24	“Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah. 
NUM.20.25	Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor. 
NUM.20.26	Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there.”
NUM.20.27	Moses did as the 
NUM.20.28	Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain, 
NUM.20.29	and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died, all the Israelites mourned for him thirty days.
NUM.21.1	When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them. 
NUM.21.2	Then Israel made this vow to the 
NUM.21.3	The 
NUM.21.4	They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea,
NUM.21.5	they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!”
NUM.21.6	Then the 
NUM.21.7	The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the 
NUM.21.8	The 
NUM.21.9	So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived.
NUM.21.10	The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth. 
NUM.21.11	Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the wilderness that faces Moab toward the sunrise. 
NUM.21.12	From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley. 
NUM.21.13	They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	That is why the Book of the Wars of the 
NUM.21.14	“…Zahab
NUM.21.14	the Arnon 
NUM.21.15	and
NUM.21.15	that lead to the settlement of Ar
NUM.21.15	and lie along the border of Moab.”
NUM.21.16	From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the 
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song:
NUM.21.17	“Spring up, O well!
NUM.21.17	Sing about it,
NUM.21.18	about the well that the princes dug,
NUM.21.18	that the nobles of the people sank—
NUM.21.18	the nobles with scepters and staffs.”
NUM.21.18	Then they went from the wilderness to Mattanah, 
NUM.21.19	from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.
NUM.21.21	Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites:
NUM.21.22	“Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.”
NUM.21.23	But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the wilderness against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel. 
NUM.21.24	Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified. 
NUM.21.25	Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements. 
NUM.21.26	Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon.
NUM.21.27	That is why the poets say:
NUM.21.27	“Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt;
NUM.21.27	let Sihon’s city be restored.
NUM.21.28	“Fire went out from Heshbon,
NUM.21.28	a blaze from the city of Sihon.
NUM.21.28	It consumed Ar of Moab,
NUM.21.28	the citizens of Arnon’s heights.
NUM.21.29	Woe to you, Moab!
NUM.21.29	You are destroyed, people of Chemosh!
NUM.21.29	He has given up his sons as fugitives
NUM.21.29	and his daughters as captives
NUM.21.29	to Sihon king of the Amorites.
NUM.21.30	“But we have overthrown them;
NUM.21.30	Heshbon’s dominion has been destroyed all the way to Dibon.
NUM.21.30	We have demolished them as far as Nophah,
NUM.21.30	which extends to Medeba.”
NUM.21.31	So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.
NUM.21.32	After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
NUM.21.33	Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei.
NUM.21.34	The 
NUM.21.35	So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land.
NUM.22.1	Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho.
NUM.22.2	Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, 
NUM.22.3	and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites.
NUM.22.4	The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.”
NUM.22.4	So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time, 
NUM.22.5	sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the Euphrates River, in his native land. Balak said:
NUM.22.5	“A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me. 
NUM.22.6	Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.”
NUM.22.7	The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.
NUM.22.8	“Spend the night here,” Balaam said to them, “and I will report back to you with the answer the 
NUM.22.9	God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?”
NUM.22.10	Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message: 
NUM.22.11	‘A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.’ ”
NUM.22.12	But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed.”
NUM.22.13	The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak’s officials, “Go back to your own country, for the 
NUM.22.14	So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
NUM.22.15	Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished than the first. 
NUM.22.16	They came to Balaam and said:
NUM.22.16	“This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me, 
NUM.22.17	because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me.”
NUM.22.18	But Balaam answered them, “Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the 
NUM.22.19	Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the 
NUM.22.20	That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.”
NUM.22.21	Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials. 
NUM.22.22	But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the 
NUM.22.23	When the donkey saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.24	Then the angel of the 
NUM.22.25	When the donkey saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.26	Then the angel of the 
NUM.22.27	When the donkey saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.28	Then the 
NUM.22.29	Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.”
NUM.22.30	The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?”
NUM.22.30	“No,” he said.
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	The angel of the 
NUM.22.33	The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared it.”
NUM.22.34	Balaam said to the angel of the 
NUM.22.35	The angel of the 
NUM.22.36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory. 
NUM.22.37	Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?”
NUM.22.38	“Well, I have come to you now,” Balaam replied. “But I can’t say whatever I please. I must speak only what God puts in my mouth.”
NUM.22.39	Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the officials who were with him. 
NUM.22.41	The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he could see the outskirts of the Israelite camp.
NUM.23.1	Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.” 
NUM.23.2	Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.23.3	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the 
NUM.23.4	God met with him, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.”
NUM.23.5	The 
NUM.23.6	So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the Moabite officials. 
NUM.23.7	Then Balaam spoke his message:
NUM.23.7	“Balak brought me from Aram,
NUM.23.7	the king of Moab from the eastern mountains.
NUM.23.7	‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me;
NUM.23.7	come, denounce Israel.’
NUM.23.8	How can I curse
NUM.23.8	those whom God has not cursed?
NUM.23.8	How can I denounce
NUM.23.8	those whom the 
NUM.23.9	From the rocky peaks I see them,
NUM.23.9	from the heights I view them.
NUM.23.9	I see a people who live apart
NUM.23.9	and do not consider themselves one of the nations.
NUM.23.10	Who can count the dust of Jacob
NUM.23.10	or number even a fourth of Israel?
NUM.23.10	Let me die the death of the righteous,
NUM.23.10	and may my final end be like theirs!”
NUM.23.11	Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!”
NUM.23.12	He answered, “Must I not speak what the 
NUM.23.13	Then Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will not see them all but only the outskirts of their camp. And from there, curse them for me.” 
NUM.23.14	So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.23.15	Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there.”
NUM.23.16	The 
NUM.23.17	So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the Moabite officials. Balak asked him, “What did the 
NUM.23.18	Then he spoke his message:
NUM.23.18	“Arise, Balak, and listen;
NUM.23.18	hear me, son of Zippor.
NUM.23.19	God is not human, that he should lie,
NUM.23.19	not a human being, that he should change his mind.
NUM.23.19	Does he speak and then not act?
NUM.23.19	Does he promise and not fulfill?
NUM.23.20	I have received a command to bless;
NUM.23.20	he has blessed, and I cannot change it.
NUM.23.21	“No misfortune is seen in Jacob,
NUM.23.21	no misery observed
NUM.23.21	The 
NUM.23.21	the shout of the King is among them.
NUM.23.22	God brought them out of Egypt;
NUM.23.22	they have the strength of a wild ox.
NUM.23.23	There is no divination against
NUM.23.23	no evil omens against
NUM.23.23	It will now be said of Jacob
NUM.23.23	and of Israel, ‘See what God has done!’
NUM.23.24	The people rise like a lioness;
NUM.23.24	they rouse themselves like a lion
NUM.23.24	that does not rest till it devours its prey
NUM.23.24	and drinks the blood of its victims.”
NUM.23.25	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!”
NUM.23.26	Balaam answered, “Did I not tell you I must do whatever the 
NUM.23.27	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.28	And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.
NUM.23.29	Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.” 
NUM.23.30	Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.24.1	Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the 
NUM.24.2	When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came on him 
NUM.24.3	and he spoke his message:
NUM.24.3	“The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,
NUM.24.3	the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly,
NUM.24.4	the prophecy of one who hears the words of God,
NUM.24.4	who sees a vision from the Almighty,
NUM.24.4	who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:
NUM.24.5	“How beautiful are your tents, Jacob,
NUM.24.5	your dwelling places, Israel!
NUM.24.6	“Like valleys they spread out,
NUM.24.6	like gardens beside a river,
NUM.24.6	like aloes planted by the 
NUM.24.6	like cedars beside the waters.
NUM.24.7	Water will flow from their buckets;
NUM.24.7	their seed will have abundant water.
NUM.24.7	“Their king will be greater than Agag;
NUM.24.7	their kingdom will be exalted.
NUM.24.8	“God brought them out of Egypt;
NUM.24.8	they have the strength of a wild ox.
NUM.24.8	They devour hostile nations
NUM.24.8	and break their bones in pieces;
NUM.24.8	with their arrows they pierce them.
NUM.24.9	Like a lion they crouch and lie down,
NUM.24.9	like a lioness—who dares to rouse them?
NUM.24.9	“May those who bless you be blessed
NUM.24.9	and those who curse you be cursed!”
NUM.24.10	Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times. 
NUM.24.11	Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the 
NUM.24.12	Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me, 
NUM.24.13	‘Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the 
NUM.24.14	Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come.”
NUM.24.15	Then he spoke his message:
NUM.24.15	“The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,
NUM.24.15	the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly,
NUM.24.16	the prophecy of one who hears the words of God,
NUM.24.16	who has knowledge from the Most High,
NUM.24.16	who sees a vision from the Almighty,
NUM.24.16	who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:
NUM.24.17	“I see him, but not now;
NUM.24.17	I behold him, but not near.
NUM.24.17	A star will come out of Jacob;
NUM.24.17	a scepter will rise out of Israel.
NUM.24.17	He will crush the foreheads of Moab,
NUM.24.17	the skulls
NUM.24.18	Edom will be conquered;
NUM.24.18	Seir, his enemy, will be conquered,
NUM.24.18	but Israel will grow strong.
NUM.24.19	A ruler will come out of Jacob
NUM.24.19	and destroy the survivors of the city.”
NUM.24.20	Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message:
NUM.24.20	“Amalek was first among the nations,
NUM.24.20	but their end will be utter destruction.”
NUM.24.21	Then he saw the Kenites and spoke his message:
NUM.24.21	“Your dwelling place is secure,
NUM.24.21	your nest is set in a rock;
NUM.24.22	yet you Kenites will be destroyed
NUM.24.22	when Ashur takes you captive.”
NUM.24.23	Then he spoke his message:
NUM.24.23	“Alas! Who can live when God does this?
NUM.24.24	Ships will come from the shores of Cyprus;
NUM.24.24	they will subdue Ashur and Eber,
NUM.24.24	but they too will come to ruin.”
NUM.24.25	Then Balaam got up and returned home, and Balak went his own way.
NUM.25.1	While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women, 
NUM.25.2	who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate the sacrificial meal and bowed down before these gods. 
NUM.25.3	So Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. And the 
NUM.25.4	The 
NUM.25.5	So Moses said to Israel’s judges, “Each of you must put to death those of your people who have yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor.”
NUM.25.6	Then an Israelite man brought into the camp a Midianite woman right before the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
NUM.25.7	When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the assembly, took a spear in his hand 
NUM.25.8	and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear into both of them, right through the Israelite man and into the woman’s stomach. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped; 
NUM.25.9	but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.
NUM.25.10	The 
NUM.25.11	“Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites. Since he was as zealous for my honor among them as I am, I did not put an end to them in my zeal. 
NUM.25.12	Therefore tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him. 
NUM.25.13	He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites.”
NUM.25.14	The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family. 
NUM.25.15	And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Kozbi daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family.
NUM.25.16	The 
NUM.25.17	“Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them. 
NUM.25.18	They treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the Peor incident involving their sister Kozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of that incident.”
NUM.26.1	After the plague the 
NUM.26.2	“Take a census of the whole Israelite community by families—all those twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army of Israel.” 
NUM.26.3	So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them and said, 
NUM.26.4	“Take a census of the men twenty years old or more, as the 
NUM.26.4	These were the Israelites who came out of Egypt:

NUM.27.4	Why should our father’s name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father’s relatives.”
NUM.27.5	So Moses brought their case before the 
NUM.27.6	and the 
NUM.27.7	“What Zelophehad’s daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father’s relatives and give their father’s inheritance to them.

NUM.30.16	These are the regulations the 
NUM.31.1	The 
NUM.31.2	“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.”
NUM.31.3	So Moses said to the people, “Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites so that they may carry out the 
NUM.31.4	Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.” 
NUM.31.5	So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel. 
NUM.31.6	Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.
NUM.31.7	They fought against Midian, as the 
NUM.31.8	Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. 
NUM.31.9	The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder. 
NUM.31.10	They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps. 
NUM.31.11	They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals, 
NUM.31.12	and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.
NUM.31.13	Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp. 
NUM.31.14	Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who returned from the battle.
NUM.31.15	“Have you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them. 
NUM.31.16	“They were the ones who followed Balaam’s advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the 
NUM.31.17	Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, 
NUM.31.18	but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.
NUM.31.19	“Anyone who has killed someone or touched someone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives. 
NUM.31.20	Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood.”
NUM.31.21	Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, “This is what is required by the law that the 
NUM.31.22	Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead 
NUM.31.23	and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water. 
NUM.31.24	On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp.”
NUM.31.25	The 
NUM.31.26	“You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured. 
NUM.31.27	Divide the spoils equally between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community.

NUM.31.30	From the Israelites’ half, select one out of every fifty, whether people, cattle, donkeys, sheep or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the 
NUM.31.31	So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the 
NUM.31.32	The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep, 
NUM.31.33	72,000 cattle, 
NUM.31.34	61,000 donkeys 
NUM.31.35	and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man.
NUM.31.36	The half share of those who fought in the battle was:
NUM.31.36	337,500 sheep, 
NUM.31.37	of which the tribute for the 
NUM.31.38	36,000 cattle, of which the tribute for the 
NUM.31.39	30,500 donkeys, of which the tribute for the 
NUM.31.40	16,000 people, of whom the tribute for the 
NUM.31.41	Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the 
NUM.31.42	The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that of the fighting men— 
NUM.31.43	the community’s half—was 337,500 sheep, 
NUM.31.44	36,000 cattle, 
NUM.31.45	30,500 donkeys 
NUM.31.46	and 16,000 people. 
NUM.31.47	From the Israelites’ half, Moses selected one out of every fifty people and animals, as the 
NUM.31.48	Then the officers who were over the units of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—went to Moses 
NUM.31.49	and said to him, “Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing. 
NUM.31.50	So we have brought as an offering to the 
NUM.31.51	Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold—all the crafted articles. 
NUM.31.52	All the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the 
NUM.31.53	Each soldier had taken plunder for himself. 
NUM.31.54	Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the 
NUM.32.1	The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock. 
NUM.32.2	So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said, 
NUM.32.3	“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon— 
NUM.32.4	the land the 
NUM.32.5	If we have found favor in your eyes,” they said, “let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”
NUM.32.6	Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, “Should your fellow Israelites go to war while you sit here? 
NUM.32.7	Why do you discourage the Israelites from crossing over into the land the 
NUM.32.8	This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land. 
NUM.32.9	After they went up to the Valley of Eshkol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the 
NUM.32.10	The 
NUM.32.11	‘Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of those who were twenty years old or more when they came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob— 
NUM.32.12	not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the 
NUM.32.13	The 
NUM.32.14	“And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the 
NUM.32.15	If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.”
NUM.32.16	Then they came up to him and said, “We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children. 
NUM.32.17	But we will arm ourselves for battle
NUM.32.18	We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received their inheritance. 
NUM.32.19	We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.”
NUM.32.20	Then Moses said to them, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the 
NUM.32.21	and if all of you who are armed cross over the Jordan before the 
NUM.32.22	then when the land is subdued before the 
NUM.32.23	“But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the 
NUM.32.24	Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised.”
NUM.32.25	The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “We your servants will do as our lord commands. 
NUM.32.26	Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead. 
NUM.32.27	But your servants, every man who is armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the 
NUM.32.28	Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes. 
NUM.32.29	He said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the 
NUM.32.30	But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan.”
NUM.32.31	The Gadites and Reubenites answered, “Your servants will do what the 
NUM.32.32	We will cross over before the 
NUM.32.33	Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the whole land with its cities and the territory around them.
NUM.32.34	The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
NUM.32.35	Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
NUM.32.36	Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks. 
NUM.32.37	And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim, 
NUM.32.38	as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt.
NUM.32.39	The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
NUM.32.40	So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there. 
NUM.32.41	Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them Havvoth Jair.
NUM.32.42	And Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements and called it Nobah after himself.
NUM.33.1	Here are the stages in the journey of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt by divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.33.2	At the 
NUM.33.3	The Israelites set out from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the Passover. They marched out defiantly in full view of all the Egyptians,

NUM.33.6	They left Sukkoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the desert.
NUM.33.7	They left Etham, turned back to Pi Hahiroth, to the east of Baal Zephon, and camped near Migdol.
NUM.33.8	They left Pi Hahiroth
NUM.33.9	They left Marah and went to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there.
NUM.33.10	They left Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
NUM.33.11	They left the Red Sea and camped in the Desert of Sin.
NUM.33.12	They left the Desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
NUM.33.13	They left Dophkah and camped at Alush.

NUM.33.37	They left Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the border of Edom. 
NUM.33.38	At the 
NUM.33.39	Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
NUM.33.40	The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming.

NUM.33.47	They left Almon Diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, near Nebo.
NUM.33.48	They left the mountains of Abarim and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho. 
NUM.33.49	There on the plains of Moab they camped along the Jordan from Beth Jeshimoth to Abel Shittim.
NUM.33.50	On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho the 
NUM.33.51	“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you cross the Jordan into Canaan, 
NUM.33.52	drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images and their cast idols, and demolish all their high places.

NUM.33.54	Distribute the land by lot, according to your clans. To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one. Whatever falls to them by lot will be theirs. Distribute it according to your ancestral tribes.
NUM.33.55	“ ‘But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land where you will live.

NUM.36.1	The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families. 
NUM.36.2	They said, “When the 
NUM.36.3	Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away. 
NUM.36.4	When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our ancestors.”
NUM.36.5	Then at the 
NUM.36.6	This is what the 
NUM.36.7	No inheritance in Israel is to pass from one tribe to another, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal inheritance of their ancestors. 
NUM.36.8	Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father’s tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of their ancestors. 
NUM.36.9	No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits.”
NUM.36.10	So Zelophehad’s daughters did as the 
NUM.36.11	Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah and Noah—married their cousins on their father’s side. 
NUM.36.12	They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father’s tribe and clan.
NUM.36.13	These are the commands and regulations the 
DEU.1.1	These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—that is, in the Arabah—opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab. 
DEU.1.2	(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)
DEU.1.3	In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the

DEU.1.8	See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the 
DEU.1.9	At that time I said to you, “You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone. 
DEU.1.10	The 
DEU.1.11	May the 
DEU.1.12	But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself? 
DEU.1.13	Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.”
DEU.1.14	You answered me, “What you propose to do is good.”
DEU.1.15	So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials. 
DEU.1.16	And I charged your judges at that time, “Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you. 
DEU.1.17	Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.” 
DEU.1.18	And at that time I told you everything you were to do.
DEU.1.19	Then, as the 
DEU.1.20	Then I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the 
DEU.1.21	See, the 
DEU.1.22	Then all of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.”
DEU.1.23	The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe. 
DEU.1.24	They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it. 
DEU.1.25	Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, “It is a good land that the 
DEU.1.26	But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the 
DEU.1.27	You grumbled in your tents and said, “The 
DEU.1.28	Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They say, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.’ ”
DEU.1.29	Then I said to you, “Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them. 
DEU.1.30	The 
DEU.1.31	and in the wilderness. There you saw how the 
DEU.1.32	In spite of this, you did not trust in the 
DEU.1.33	who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.
DEU.1.34	When the 
DEU.1.35	“No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors, 
DEU.1.36	except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the 
DEU.1.37	Because of you the 
DEU.1.38	But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it. 
DEU.1.39	And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad—they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it. 
DEU.1.40	But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.
DEU.1.41	Then you replied, “We have sinned against the 
DEU.1.42	But the 
DEU.1.43	So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the 
DEU.1.44	The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah. 
DEU.1.45	You came back and wept before the 
DEU.1.46	And so you stayed in Kadesh many days—all the time you spent there.
DEU.2.1	Then we turned back and set out toward the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea,
DEU.2.2	Then the 
DEU.2.3	“You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north. 
DEU.2.4	Give the people these orders: ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful. 
DEU.2.5	Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own. 
DEU.2.6	You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’ ”
DEU.2.7	The 
DEU.2.8	So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.
DEU.2.9	Then the 
DEU.2.10	(The Emites used to live there—a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. 
DEU.2.11	Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites. 
DEU.2.12	Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the 
DEU.2.13	And the 
DEU.2.14	Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the 
DEU.2.15	The 
DEU.2.16	Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died, 
DEU.2.17	the 
DEU.2.18	“Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar. 
DEU.2.19	When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.”
DEU.2.20	(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites. 
DEU.2.21	They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The 
DEU.2.22	The 
DEU.2.23	And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor
DEU.2.24	“Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle. 
DEU.2.25	This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you.”
DEU.2.26	From the Desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying, 
DEU.2.27	“Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left. 
DEU.2.28	Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot— 
DEU.2.29	as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us—until we cross the Jordan into the land the 
DEU.2.30	But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the 
DEU.2.31	The 
DEU.2.32	When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz, 
DEU.2.33	the 
DEU.2.34	At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed
DEU.2.35	But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves. 
DEU.2.36	From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The 
DEU.2.37	But in accordance with the command of the 
DEU.3.1	Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei. 
DEU.3.2	The 
DEU.3.3	So the 
DEU.3.4	At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan. 
DEU.3.5	All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages. 
DEU.3.6	We completely destroyed
DEU.3.7	But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.
DEU.3.8	So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon. 
DEU.3.9	(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.) 
DEU.3.10	We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	(Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites. His bed was decorated with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide.
DEU.3.12	Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns. 
DEU.3.13	The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites. 
DEU.3.14	Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair.
DEU.3.15	And I gave Gilead to Makir. 
DEU.3.16	But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites. 
DEU.3.17	Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.
DEU.3.18	I commanded you at that time: “The 
DEU.3.19	However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you, 
DEU.3.20	until the 
DEU.3.21	At that time I commanded Joshua: “You have seen with your own eyes all that the 
DEU.3.22	Do not be afraid of them; the 
DEU.3.23	At that time I pleaded with the 
DEU.3.24	“Sovereign 
DEU.3.25	Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that fine hill country and Lebanon.”
DEU.3.26	But because of you the 
DEU.3.27	Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan. 
DEU.3.28	But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.” 
DEU.3.29	So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
DEU.4.1	Now, Israel, hear the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land the 
DEU.4.2	Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the 
DEU.4.3	You saw with your own eyes what the 
DEU.4.4	but all of you who held fast to the 
DEU.4.5	See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the 
DEU.4.6	Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.” 
DEU.4.7	What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the 
DEU.4.8	And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?
DEU.4.9	Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them. 
DEU.4.10	Remember the day you stood before the 
DEU.4.11	You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness. 
DEU.4.12	Then the 
DEU.4.13	He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets. 
DEU.4.14	And the 
DEU.4.15	You saw no form of any kind the day the 
DEU.4.16	so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman, 
DEU.4.17	or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air, 
DEU.4.18	or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below. 
DEU.4.19	And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars—all the heavenly array—do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the 
DEU.4.20	But as for you, the 
DEU.4.21	The 
DEU.4.22	I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land. 
DEU.4.23	Be careful not to forget the covenant of the 
DEU.4.24	For the 
DEU.4.25	After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time—if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the 
DEU.4.26	I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed. 
DEU.4.27	The 
DEU.4.28	There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell. 
DEU.4.29	But if from there you seek the 
DEU.4.30	When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the 
DEU.4.31	For the 
DEU.4.32	Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of? 
DEU.4.33	Has any other people heard the voice of God
DEU.4.34	Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the 
DEU.4.35	You were shown these things so that you might know that the 
DEU.4.36	From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire. 
DEU.4.37	Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength, 
DEU.4.38	to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.
DEU.4.39	Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the 
DEU.4.40	Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the 
DEU.4.41	Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan, 
DEU.4.42	to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally killed a neighbor without malice aforethought. They could flee into one of these cities and save their life. 
DEU.4.43	The cities were these: Bezer in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
DEU.4.44	This is the law Moses set before the Israelites. 
DEU.4.45	These are the stipulations, decrees and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt 
DEU.4.46	and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan. 
DEU.4.48	This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Sirion
DEU.4.49	and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Dead Sea,
DEU.5.1	Moses summoned all Israel and said:
DEU.5.1	Hear, Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them. 
DEU.5.2	The 
DEU.5.3	It was not with our ancestors
DEU.5.4	The 
DEU.5.5	(At that time I stood between the 
DEU.5.6	“I am the 
DEU.5.7	“You shall have no other gods before
DEU.5.8	“You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. 
DEU.5.9	You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the 
DEU.5.10	but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
DEU.5.11	“You shall not misuse the name of the 
DEU.5.12	“Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the 
DEU.5.13	Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day is a sabbath to the 
DEU.5.15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the 
DEU.5.16	“Honor your father and your mother, as the 
DEU.5.17	“You shall not murder.
DEU.5.18	“You shall not commit adultery.
DEU.5.19	“You shall not steal.
DEU.5.20	“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
DEU.5.21	“You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor’s house or land, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
DEU.5.22	These are the commandments the 
DEU.5.23	When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me. 
DEU.5.24	And you said, “The 
DEU.5.25	But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the 
DEU.5.26	For what mortal has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived? 
DEU.5.27	Go near and listen to all that the 
DEU.5.28	The 
DEU.5.29	Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever!
DEU.5.30	“Go, tell them to return to their tents. 
DEU.5.31	But you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess.”
DEU.5.32	So be careful to do what the 
DEU.5.33	Walk in obedience to all that the 
DEU.6.1	These are the commands, decrees and laws the 
DEU.6.2	so that you, your children and their children after them may fear the 
DEU.6.3	Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the 
DEU.6.4	Hear, O Israel: The 
DEU.6.5	Love the 
DEU.6.6	These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. 
DEU.6.7	Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 
DEU.6.8	Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 
DEU.6.9	Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.
DEU.6.10	When the 
DEU.6.11	houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied, 
DEU.6.12	be careful that you do not forget the 
DEU.6.13	Fear the 
DEU.6.14	Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you; 
DEU.6.15	for the 
DEU.6.16	Do not put the 
DEU.6.17	Be sure to keep the commands of the 
DEU.6.18	Do what is right and good in the 
DEU.6.19	thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the 
DEU.6.20	In the future, when your son asks you, “What is the meaning of the stipulations, decrees and laws the 
DEU.6.21	tell him: “We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the 
DEU.6.22	Before our eyes the 
DEU.6.23	But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land he promised on oath to our ancestors. 
DEU.6.24	The 
DEU.6.25	And if we are careful to obey all this law before the 
DEU.7.1	When the 
DEU.7.2	and when the 
DEU.7.3	Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons, 
DEU.7.4	for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods, and the 
DEU.7.5	This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles
DEU.7.6	For you are a people holy to the 
DEU.7.7	The 
DEU.7.8	But it was because the 
DEU.7.9	Know therefore that the 
DEU.7.10	But
DEU.7.10	those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction;
DEU.7.10	he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.
DEU.7.11	Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you today.
DEU.7.12	If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the 
DEU.7.13	He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you. 
DEU.7.14	You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young. 
DEU.7.15	The 
DEU.7.16	You must destroy all the peoples the 
DEU.7.17	You may say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?” 
DEU.7.18	But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the 
DEU.7.19	You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the 
DEU.7.20	Moreover, the 
DEU.7.21	Do not be terrified by them, for the 
DEU.7.22	The 
DEU.7.23	But the 
DEU.7.24	He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them. 
DEU.7.25	The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the 
DEU.7.26	Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.
DEU.8.1	Be careful to follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase and may enter and possess the land the 
DEU.8.2	Remember how the 
DEU.8.3	He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the 
DEU.8.4	Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years. 
DEU.8.5	Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the 
DEU.8.6	Observe the commands of the 
DEU.8.7	For the 
DEU.8.8	a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey; 
DEU.8.9	a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills.
DEU.8.10	When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the 
DEU.8.11	Be careful that you do not forget the 
DEU.8.12	Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down, 
DEU.8.13	and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied, 
DEU.8.14	then your heart will become proud and you will forget the 
DEU.8.15	He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock. 
DEU.8.16	He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness, something your ancestors had never known, to humble and test you so that in the end it might go well with you. 
DEU.8.17	You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.” 
DEU.8.18	But remember the 
DEU.8.19	If you ever forget the 
DEU.8.20	Like the nations the 
DEU.9.1	Hear, Israel: You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky. 
DEU.9.2	The people are strong and tall—Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: “Who can stand up against the Anakites?” 
DEU.9.3	But be assured today that the 
DEU.9.4	After the 
DEU.9.5	It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the 
DEU.9.6	Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the 
DEU.9.7	Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the 
DEU.9.8	At Horeb you aroused the 
DEU.9.9	When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the 
DEU.9.10	The 
DEU.9.11	At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the 
DEU.9.12	Then the 
DEU.9.13	And the 
DEU.9.14	Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.”
DEU.9.15	So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. 
DEU.9.16	When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the 
DEU.9.17	So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes.
DEU.9.18	Then once again I fell prostrate before the 
DEU.9.19	I feared the anger and wrath of the 
DEU.9.20	And the 
DEU.9.21	Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.
DEU.9.22	You also made the 
DEU.9.23	And when the 
DEU.9.24	You have been rebellious against the 
DEU.9.25	I lay prostrate before the 
DEU.9.26	I prayed to the 
DEU.9.27	Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin. 
DEU.9.28	Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, ‘Because the 
DEU.9.29	But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.”
DEU.10.1	At that time the 
DEU.10.2	I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the ark.”
DEU.10.3	So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. 
DEU.10.4	The 
DEU.10.5	Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the 
DEU.10.6	(The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest. 
DEU.10.7	From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water. 
DEU.10.8	At that time the 
DEU.10.9	That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the 
DEU.10.10	Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did the first time, and the 
DEU.10.11	“Go,” the 
DEU.10.12	And now, Israel, what does the 
DEU.10.13	and to observe the 
DEU.10.14	To the 
DEU.10.15	Yet the 
DEU.10.16	Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer. 
DEU.10.17	For the 
DEU.10.18	He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing. 
DEU.10.19	And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	Fear the 
DEU.10.21	He is the one you praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes. 
DEU.10.22	Your ancestors who went down into Egypt were seventy in all, and now the 
DEU.11.1	Love the 
DEU.11.2	Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the 
DEU.11.3	the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country; 
DEU.11.4	what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea
DEU.11.5	It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the wilderness until you arrived at this place, 
DEU.11.6	and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their households, their tents and every living thing that belonged to them. 
DEU.11.7	But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the 
DEU.11.8	Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, 
DEU.11.9	and so that you may live long in the land the 
DEU.11.10	The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden. 
DEU.11.11	But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven. 
DEU.11.12	It is a land the 
DEU.11.13	So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today—to love the 
DEU.11.14	then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil. 
DEU.11.15	I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.
DEU.11.16	Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them. 
DEU.11.17	Then the 
DEU.11.18	Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 
DEU.11.19	Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 
DEU.11.20	Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates, 
DEU.11.21	so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the 
DEU.11.22	If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow—to love the 
DEU.11.23	then the 
DEU.11.24	Every place where you set your foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea. 
DEU.11.25	No one will be able to stand against you. The 
DEU.11.26	See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse— 
DEU.11.27	the blessing if you obey the commands of the 
DEU.11.28	the curse if you disobey the commands of the 
DEU.11.29	When the 
DEU.11.30	As you know, these mountains are across the Jordan, westward, toward the setting sun, near the great trees of Moreh, in the territory of those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal. 
DEU.11.31	You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the 
DEU.11.32	be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you today.
DEU.12.1	These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the 
DEU.12.2	Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains, on the hills and under every spreading tree, where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods. 
DEU.12.3	Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places.
DEU.12.4	You must not worship the 
DEU.12.5	But you are to seek the place the 
DEU.12.6	there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks. 
DEU.12.7	There, in the presence of the 
DEU.12.8	You are not to do as we do here today, everyone doing as they see fit, 
DEU.12.9	since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the 
DEU.12.10	But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the 
DEU.12.11	Then to the place the 
DEU.12.12	And there rejoice before the 
DEU.12.13	Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please. 
DEU.12.14	Offer them only at the place the 
DEU.12.15	Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or deer, according to the blessing the 
DEU.12.16	But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.17	You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and olive oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or whatever you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts. 
DEU.12.18	Instead, you are to eat them in the presence of the 
DEU.12.19	Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.
DEU.12.20	When the 
DEU.12.21	If the place where the 
DEU.12.22	Eat them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat. 
DEU.12.23	But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat. 
DEU.12.24	You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.25	Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the 
DEU.12.26	But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give, and go to the place the 
DEU.12.27	Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the 
DEU.12.28	Be careful to obey all these regulations I am giving you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the 
DEU.12.29	The 
DEU.12.30	and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same.” 
DEU.12.31	You must not worship the 
DEU.12.32	See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.
DEU.13.1	If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a sign or wonder, 
DEU.13.2	and if the sign or wonder spoken of takes place, and the prophet says, “Let us follow other gods” (gods you have not known) “and let us worship them,” 
DEU.13.3	you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The 
DEU.13.4	It is the 
DEU.13.5	That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for inciting rebellion against the 
DEU.13.6	If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, 
DEU.13.7	gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other), 
DEU.13.8	do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. 
DEU.13.9	You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. 
DEU.13.10	Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the 
DEU.13.11	Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one among you will do such an evil thing again.
DEU.13.12	If you hear it said about one of the towns the 
DEU.13.13	that troublemakers have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods you have not known), 
DEU.13.14	then you must inquire, probe and investigate it thoroughly. And if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you, 
DEU.13.15	you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town. You must destroy it completely,
DEU.13.16	You are to gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the 
DEU.13.17	and none of the condemned things
DEU.13.18	because you obey the 
DEU.14.1	You are the children of the 
DEU.14.2	for you are a people holy to the 
DEU.14.3	Do not eat any detestable thing. 
DEU.14.4	These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, 
DEU.14.5	the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep.
DEU.14.6	You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud. 
DEU.14.7	However, of those that chew the cud or that have a divided hoof you may not eat the camel, the rabbit or the hyrax. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a divided hoof; they are ceremonially unclean for you. 
DEU.14.8	The pig is also unclean; although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses.
DEU.14.9	Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that has fins and scales. 
DEU.14.10	But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; for you it is unclean.
DEU.14.11	You may eat any clean bird. 
DEU.14.12	But these you may not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, 
DEU.14.13	the red kite, the black kite, any kind of falcon, 
DEU.14.14	any kind of raven, 
DEU.14.15	the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, 
DEU.14.16	the little owl, the great owl, the white owl, 
DEU.14.17	the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant, 
DEU.14.18	the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat.
DEU.14.19	All flying insects are unclean to you; do not eat them. 
DEU.14.20	But any winged creature that is clean you may eat.
DEU.14.21	Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to the foreigner residing in any of your towns, and they may eat it, or you may sell it to any other foreigner. But you are a people holy to the 
DEU.14.21	Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
DEU.14.22	Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year. 
DEU.14.23	Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the 
DEU.14.24	But if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the 
DEU.14.25	then exchange your tithe for silver, and take the silver with you and go to the place the 
DEU.14.26	Use the silver to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the 
DEU.14.27	And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no allotment or inheritance of their own.
DEU.14.28	At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year’s produce and store it in your towns, 
DEU.14.29	so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own) and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the 
DEU.15.1	At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. 
DEU.15.2	This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people, because the 
DEU.15.3	You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you. 
DEU.15.4	However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the 
DEU.15.5	if only you fully obey the 
DEU.15.6	For the 
DEU.15.7	If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the 
DEU.15.8	Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need. 
DEU.15.9	Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: “The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near,” so that you do not show ill will toward the needy among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing. They may then appeal to the 
DEU.15.10	Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the 
DEU.15.11	There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land.
DEU.15.12	If any of your people—Hebrew men or women—sell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free. 
DEU.15.13	And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed. 
DEU.15.14	Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the 
DEU.15.15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the 
DEU.15.16	But if your servant says to you, “I do not want to leave you,” because he loves you and your family and is well off with you, 
DEU.15.17	then take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant.
DEU.15.18	Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the 
DEU.15.19	Set apart for the 
DEU.15.20	Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the 
DEU.15.21	If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the 
DEU.15.22	You are to eat it in your own towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer. 
DEU.15.23	But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
DEU.16.1	Observe the month of Aviv and celebrate the Passover of the 
DEU.16.2	Sacrifice as the Passover to the 
DEU.16.3	Do not eat it with bread made with yeast, but for seven days eat unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you left Egypt in haste—so that all the days of your life you may remember the time of your departure from Egypt. 
DEU.16.4	Let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days. Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning.
DEU.16.5	You must not sacrifice the Passover in any town the 
DEU.16.6	except in the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name. There you must sacrifice the Passover in the evening, when the sun goes down, on the anniversary
DEU.16.7	Roast it and eat it at the place the 
DEU.16.8	For six days eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day hold an assembly to the 
DEU.16.9	Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain. 
DEU.16.10	Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the 
DEU.16.11	And rejoice before the 
DEU.16.12	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and follow carefully these decrees.
DEU.16.13	Celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress. 
DEU.16.14	Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns. 
DEU.16.15	For seven days celebrate the festival to the 
DEU.16.16	Three times a year all your men must appear before the 
DEU.16.17	Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the 
DEU.16.18	Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the 
DEU.16.19	Do not pervert justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent. 
DEU.16.20	Follow justice and justice alone, so that you may live and possess the land the 
DEU.16.21	Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build to the 
DEU.16.22	and do not erect a sacred stone, for these the 
DEU.17.1	Do not sacrifice to the 
DEU.17.2	If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the 
DEU.17.3	and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars in the sky, 
DEU.17.4	and this has been brought to your attention, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, 
DEU.17.5	take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death. 
DEU.17.6	On the testimony of two or three witnesses a person is to be put to death, but no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. 
DEU.17.7	The hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting that person to death, and then the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from among you.
DEU.17.8	If cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judge—whether bloodshed, lawsuits or assaults—take them to the place the 
DEU.17.9	Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who is in office at that time. Inquire of them and they will give you the verdict. 
DEU.17.10	You must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the 
DEU.17.11	Act according to whatever they teach you and the decisions they give you. Do not turn aside from what they tell you, to the right or to the left. 
DEU.17.12	Anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the 
DEU.17.13	All the people will hear and be afraid, and will not be contemptuous again.
DEU.17.14	When you enter the land the 
DEU.17.15	be sure to appoint over you a king the 
DEU.17.16	The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the 
DEU.17.17	He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.
DEU.17.18	When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the Levitical priests. 
DEU.17.19	It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the 
DEU.17.20	and not consider himself better than his fellow Israelites and turn from the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.
DEU.18.1	The Levitical priests—indeed, the whole tribe of Levi—are to have no allotment or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the food offerings presented to the 
DEU.18.2	They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the 
DEU.18.3	This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep: the shoulder, the internal organs and the meat from the head. 
DEU.18.4	You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep, 
DEU.18.5	for the 
DEU.18.6	If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the 
DEU.18.7	he may minister in the name of the 
DEU.18.8	He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions.
DEU.18.9	When you enter the land the 
DEU.18.10	Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, 
DEU.18.11	or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. 
DEU.18.12	Anyone who does these things is detestable to the 
DEU.18.13	You must be blameless before the 
DEU.18.14	The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the 
DEU.18.15	The 
DEU.18.16	For this is what you asked of the 
DEU.18.17	The 
DEU.18.18	I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him. 
DEU.18.19	I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name. 
DEU.18.20	But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to death.”
DEU.18.21	You may say to yourselves, “How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the 
DEU.18.22	If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the 
DEU.19.1	When the 
DEU.19.2	then set aside for yourselves three cities in the land the 
DEU.19.3	Determine the distances involved and divide into three parts the land the 
DEU.19.4	This is the rule concerning anyone who kills a person and flees there for safety—anyone who kills a neighbor unintentionally, without malice aforethought. 
DEU.19.5	For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life. 
DEU.19.6	Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought. 
DEU.19.7	This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities.
DEU.19.8	If the 
DEU.19.9	because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today—to love the 
DEU.19.10	Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the 
DEU.19.11	But if out of hate someone lies in wait, assaults and kills a neighbor, and then flees to one of these cities, 
DEU.19.12	the killer shall be sent for by the town elders, be brought back from the city, and be handed over to the avenger of blood to die. 
DEU.19.13	Show no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you.
DEU.19.14	Do not move your neighbor’s boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the 
DEU.19.15	One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
DEU.19.16	If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime, 
DEU.19.17	the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the 
DEU.19.18	The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite, 
DEU.19.19	then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other party. You must purge the evil from among you. 
DEU.19.20	The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you. 
DEU.19.21	Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
DEU.20.1	When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the 
DEU.20.2	When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and address the army. 
DEU.20.3	He shall say: “Hear, Israel: Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not panic or be terrified by them. 
DEU.20.4	For the 
DEU.20.5	The officers shall say to the army: “Has anyone built a new house and not yet begun to live in it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else may begin to live in it. 
DEU.20.6	Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it. 
DEU.20.7	Has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else marry her.” 
DEU.20.8	Then the officers shall add, “Is anyone afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his fellow soldiers will not become disheartened too.” 
DEU.20.9	When the officers have finished speaking to the army, they shall appoint commanders over it.
DEU.20.10	When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. 
DEU.20.11	If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. 
DEU.20.12	If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. 
DEU.20.13	When the 
DEU.20.14	As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the 
DEU.20.15	This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.
DEU.20.16	However, in the cities of the nations the 
DEU.20.17	Completely destroy
DEU.20.18	Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the 
DEU.20.19	When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees people, that you should besiege them?
DEU.20.20	However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls.
DEU.21.1	If someone is found slain, lying in a field in the land the 
DEU.21.2	your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance from the body to the neighboring towns. 
DEU.21.3	Then the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked and has never worn a yoke 
DEU.21.4	and lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where there is a flowing stream. There in the valley they are to break the heifer’s neck. 
DEU.21.5	The Levitical priests shall step forward, for the 
DEU.21.6	Then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley, 
DEU.21.7	and they shall declare: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done. 
DEU.21.8	Accept this atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, 
DEU.21.9	and you will have purged from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the 
DEU.21.10	When you go to war against your enemies and the 
DEU.21.11	if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife. 
DEU.21.12	Bring her into your home and have her shave her head, trim her nails 
DEU.21.13	and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife. 
DEU.21.14	If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.
DEU.21.15	If a man has two wives, and he loves one but not the other, and both bear him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love, 
DEU.21.16	when he wills his property to his sons, he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn, the son of the wife he does not love. 
DEU.21.17	He must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double share of all he has. That son is the first sign of his father’s strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him.
DEU.21.18	If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, 
DEU.21.19	his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. 
DEU.21.20	They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.” 
DEU.21.21	Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.
DEU.21.22	If someone guilty of a capital offense is put to death and their body is exposed on a pole, 
DEU.21.23	you must not leave the body hanging on the pole overnight. Be sure to bury it that same day, because anyone who is hung on a pole is under God’s curse. You must not desecrate the land the 
DEU.22.1	If you see your fellow Israelite’s ox or sheep straying, do not ignore it but be sure to take it back to its owner. 
DEU.22.2	If they do not live near you or if you do not know who owns it, take it home with you and keep it until they come looking for it. Then give it back. 
DEU.22.3	Do the same if you find their donkey or cloak or anything else they have lost. Do not ignore it.
DEU.22.4	If you see your fellow Israelite’s donkey or ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it. Help the owner get it to its feet.
DEU.22.5	A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for the 
DEU.22.6	If you come across a bird’s nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young. 
DEU.22.7	You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life.
DEU.22.8	When you build a new house, make a parapet around your roof so that you may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from the roof.
DEU.22.9	Do not plant two kinds of seed in your vineyard; if you do, not only the crops you plant but also the fruit of the vineyard will be defiled.
DEU.22.10	Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
DEU.22.11	Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
DEU.22.12	Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.
DEU.22.13	If a man takes a wife and, after sleeping with her, dislikes her 
DEU.22.14	and slanders her and gives her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,” 
DEU.22.15	then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring to the town elders at the gate proof that she was a virgin. 
DEU.22.16	Her father will say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her. 
DEU.22.17	Now he has slandered her and said, ‘I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.’ But here is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.” Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town, 
DEU.22.18	and the elders shall take the man and punish him. 
DEU.22.19	They shall fine him a hundred shekels
DEU.22.20	If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found, 
DEU.22.21	she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done an outrageous thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from among you.
DEU.22.22	If a man is found sleeping with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.
DEU.22.23	If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her, 
DEU.22.24	you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the young woman because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you.
DEU.22.25	But if out in the country a man happens to meet a young woman pledged to be married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die. 
DEU.22.26	Do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is like that of someone who attacks and murders a neighbor, 
DEU.22.27	for the man found the young woman out in the country, and though the betrothed woman screamed, there was no one to rescue her.
DEU.22.28	If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, 
DEU.22.29	he shall pay her father fifty shekels
DEU.22.30	A man is not to marry his father’s wife; he must not dishonor his father’s bed.
DEU.23.1	No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the 
DEU.23.2	No one born of a forbidden marriage
DEU.23.3	No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the 
DEU.23.4	For they did not come to meet you with bread and water on your way when you came out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim
DEU.23.5	However, the 
DEU.23.6	Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them as long as you live.
DEU.23.7	Do not despise an Edomite, for the Edomites are related to you. Do not despise an Egyptian, because you resided as foreigners in their country. 
DEU.23.8	The third generation of children born to them may enter the assembly of the 
DEU.23.9	When you are encamped against your enemies, keep away from everything impure. 
DEU.23.10	If one of your men is unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he is to go outside the camp and stay there. 
DEU.23.11	But as evening approaches he is to wash himself, and at sunset he may return to the camp.
DEU.23.12	Designate a place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself. 
DEU.23.13	As part of your equipment have something to dig with, and when you relieve yourself, dig a hole and cover up your excrement. 
DEU.23.14	For the 
DEU.23.15	If a slave has taken refuge with you, do not hand them over to their master. 
DEU.23.16	Let them live among you wherever they like and in whatever town they choose. Do not oppress them.
DEU.23.17	No Israelite man or woman is to become a shrine prostitute. 
DEU.23.18	You must not bring the earnings of a female prostitute or of a male prostitute
DEU.23.19	Do not charge a fellow Israelite interest, whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest. 
DEU.23.20	You may charge a foreigner interest, but not a fellow Israelite, so that the 
DEU.23.21	If you make a vow to the 
DEU.23.22	But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty. 
DEU.23.23	Whatever your lips utter you must be sure to do, because you made your vow freely to the 
DEU.23.24	If you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat all the grapes you want, but do not put any in your basket. 
DEU.23.25	If you enter your neighbor’s grainfield, you may pick kernels with your hands, but you must not put a sickle to their standing grain.
DEU.24.1	If a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce, gives it to her and sends her from his house, 
DEU.24.2	and if after she leaves his house she becomes the wife of another man, 
DEU.24.3	and her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce, gives it to her and sends her from his house, or if he dies, 
DEU.24.4	then her first husband, who divorced her, is not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled. That would be detestable in the eyes of the 
DEU.24.5	If a man has recently married, he must not be sent to war or have any other duty laid on him. For one year he is to be free to stay at home and bring happiness to the wife he has married.
DEU.24.6	Do not take a pair of millstones—not even the upper one—as security for a debt, because that would be taking a person’s livelihood as security.
DEU.24.7	If someone is caught kidnapping a fellow Israelite and treating or selling them as a slave, the kidnapper must die. You must purge the evil from among you.
DEU.24.8	In cases of defiling skin diseases,
DEU.24.9	Remember what the 
DEU.24.10	When you make a loan of any kind to your neighbor, do not go into their house to get what is offered to you as a pledge. 
DEU.24.11	Stay outside and let the neighbor to whom you are making the loan bring the pledge out to you. 
DEU.24.12	If the neighbor is poor, do not go to sleep with their pledge in your possession. 
DEU.24.13	Return their cloak by sunset so that your neighbor may sleep in it. Then they will thank you, and it will be regarded as a righteous act in the sight of the 
DEU.24.14	Do not take advantage of a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether that worker is a fellow Israelite or a foreigner residing in one of your towns. 
DEU.24.15	Pay them their wages each day before sunset, because they are poor and are counting on it. Otherwise they may cry to the 
DEU.24.16	Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.
DEU.24.17	Do not deprive the foreigner or the fatherless of justice, or take the cloak of the widow as a pledge. 
DEU.24.18	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the 
DEU.24.19	When you are harvesting in your field and you overlook a sheaf, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, so that the 
DEU.24.20	When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow. 
DEU.24.21	When you harvest the grapes in your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow. 
DEU.24.22	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. That is why I command you to do this.
DEU.25.1	When people have a dispute, they are to take it to court and the judges will decide the case, acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty. 
DEU.25.2	If the guilty person deserves to be beaten, the judge shall make them lie down and have them flogged in his presence with the number of lashes the crime deserves, 
DEU.25.3	but the judge must not impose more than forty lashes. If the guilty party is flogged more than that, your fellow Israelite will be degraded in your eyes.
DEU.25.4	Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.
DEU.25.5	If brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son, his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband’s brother shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to her. 
DEU.25.6	The first son she bears shall carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
DEU.25.7	However, if a man does not want to marry his brother’s wife, she shall go to the elders at the town gate and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to carry on his brother’s name in Israel. He will not fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to me.” 
DEU.25.8	Then the elders of his town shall summon him and talk to him. If he persists in saying, “I do not want to marry her,” 
DEU.25.9	his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, take off one of his sandals, spit in his face and say, “This is what is done to the man who will not build up his brother’s family line.” 
DEU.25.10	That man’s line shall be known in Israel as The Family of the Unsandaled.
DEU.25.11	If two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes him by his private parts, 
DEU.25.12	you shall cut off her hand. Show her no pity.
DEU.25.13	Do not have two differing weights in your bag—one heavy, one light. 
DEU.25.14	Do not have two differing measures in your house—one large, one small. 
DEU.25.15	You must have accurate and honest weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land the 
DEU.25.16	For the 
DEU.25.17	Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt. 
DEU.25.18	When you were weary and worn out, they met you on your journey and attacked all who were lagging behind; they had no fear of God. 
DEU.25.19	When the 
DEU.26.1	When you have entered the land the 
DEU.26.2	take some of the firstfruits of all that you produce from the soil of the land the 
DEU.26.3	and say to the priest in office at the time, “I declare today to the 
DEU.26.4	The priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the 
DEU.26.5	Then you shall declare before the 
DEU.26.6	But the Egyptians mistreated us and made us suffer, subjecting us to harsh labor. 
DEU.26.7	Then we cried out to the 
DEU.26.8	So the 
DEU.26.9	He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
DEU.26.10	and now I bring the firstfruits of the soil that you, 
DEU.26.11	Then you and the Levites and the foreigners residing among you shall rejoice in all the good things the 
DEU.26.12	When you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied. 
DEU.26.13	Then say to the 
DEU.26.14	I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while I was in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor have I offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the 
DEU.26.15	Look down from heaven, your holy dwelling place, and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us as you promised on oath to our ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.”
DEU.26.16	The 
DEU.26.17	You have declared this day that the 
DEU.26.18	And the 
DEU.26.19	He has declared that he will set you in praise, fame and honor high above all the nations he has made and that you will be a people holy to the 
DEU.27.1	Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: “Keep all these commands that I give you today. 
DEU.27.2	When you have crossed the Jordan into the land the 
DEU.27.3	Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land the 
DEU.27.4	And when you have crossed the Jordan, set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I command you today, and coat them with plaster. 
DEU.27.5	Build there an altar to the 
DEU.27.6	Build the altar of the 
DEU.27.7	Sacrifice fellowship offerings there, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the 
DEU.27.8	And you shall write very clearly all the words of this law on these stones you have set up.”
DEU.27.9	Then Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, “Be silent, Israel, and listen! You have now become the people of the 
DEU.27.10	Obey the 
DEU.27.11	On the same day Moses commanded the people:
DEU.27.12	When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin. 
DEU.27.13	And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali.
DEU.27.14	The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice:
DEU.27.15	“Cursed is anyone who makes an idol—a thing detestable to the 
DEU.27.15	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.16	“Cursed is anyone who dishonors their father or mother.”
DEU.27.16	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.17	“Cursed is anyone who moves their neighbor’s boundary stone.”
DEU.27.17	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.18	“Cursed is anyone who leads the blind astray on the road.”
DEU.27.18	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.19	“Cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow.”
DEU.27.19	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.20	“Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his father’s wife, for he dishonors his father’s bed.”
DEU.27.20	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.21	“Cursed is anyone who has sexual relations with any animal.”
DEU.27.21	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.22	“Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.”
DEU.27.22	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.23	“Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his mother-in-law.”
DEU.27.23	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.24	“Cursed is anyone who kills their neighbor secretly.”
DEU.27.24	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.25	“Cursed is anyone who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person.”
DEU.27.25	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.27.26	“Cursed is anyone who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out.”
DEU.27.26	Then all the people shall say, “Amen!”
DEU.28.1	If you fully obey the 
DEU.28.2	All these blessings will come on you and accompany you if you obey the 
DEU.28.3	You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country.
DEU.28.4	The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and the young of your livestock—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.
DEU.28.5	Your basket and your kneading trough will be blessed.
DEU.28.6	You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out.
DEU.28.7	The 
DEU.28.8	The 
DEU.28.9	The 
DEU.28.10	Then all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the 
DEU.28.11	The 
DEU.28.12	The 
DEU.28.13	The 
DEU.28.14	Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them.
DEU.28.15	However, if you do not obey the 
DEU.28.16	You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country.
DEU.28.17	Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed.
DEU.28.18	The fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the crops of your land, and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.
DEU.28.19	You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.
DEU.28.20	The 
DEU.28.21	The 
DEU.28.22	The 
DEU.28.23	The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron. 
DEU.28.24	The 
DEU.28.25	The 
DEU.28.26	Your carcasses will be food for all the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away. 
DEU.28.27	The 
DEU.28.28	The 
DEU.28.29	At midday you will grope about like a blind person in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you.
DEU.28.30	You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and rape her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit. 
DEU.28.31	Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them. 
DEU.28.32	Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand. 
DEU.28.33	A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days. 
DEU.28.34	The sights you see will drive you mad. 
DEU.28.35	The 
DEU.28.36	The 
DEU.28.37	You will become a thing of horror, a byword and an object of ridicule among all the peoples where the 
DEU.28.38	You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it. 
DEU.28.39	You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them. 
DEU.28.40	You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off. 
DEU.28.41	You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity. 
DEU.28.42	Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land.
DEU.28.43	The foreigners who reside among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower. 
DEU.28.44	They will lend to you, but you will not lend to them. They will be the head, but you will be the tail.
DEU.28.45	All these curses will come on you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the 
DEU.28.46	They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever. 
DEU.28.47	Because you did not serve the 
DEU.28.48	therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the 
DEU.28.49	The 
DEU.28.50	a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young. 
DEU.28.51	They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or olive oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined. 
DEU.28.52	They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the 
DEU.28.53	Because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the 
DEU.28.54	Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children, 
DEU.28.55	and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities. 
DEU.28.56	The most gentle and sensitive woman among you—so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot—will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter 
DEU.28.57	the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For in her dire need she intends to eat them secretly because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of your cities.
DEU.28.58	If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name—the 
DEU.28.59	the 
DEU.28.60	He will bring on you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. 
DEU.28.61	The 
DEU.28.62	You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the 
DEU.28.63	Just as it pleased the 
DEU.28.64	Then the 
DEU.28.65	Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the 
DEU.28.66	You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life. 
DEU.28.67	In the morning you will say, “If only it were evening!” and in the evening, “If only it were morning!”—because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see. 
DEU.28.68	The 
DEU.29.1	These are the terms of the covenant the 
DEU.29.2	Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them:
DEU.29.2	Your eyes have seen all that the 
DEU.29.3	With your own eyes you saw those great trials, those signs and great wonders. 
DEU.29.4	But to this day the 
DEU.29.5	Yet the 
DEU.29.6	You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the 
DEU.29.7	When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them. 
DEU.29.8	We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
DEU.29.9	Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do. 
DEU.29.10	All of you are standing today in the presence of the 
DEU.29.11	together with your children and your wives, and the foreigners living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water. 
DEU.29.12	You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the 
DEU.29.13	to confirm you this day as his people, that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
DEU.29.14	I am making this covenant, with its oath, not only with you 
DEU.29.15	who are standing here with us today in the presence of the 
DEU.29.16	You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here. 
DEU.29.17	You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold. 
DEU.29.18	Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the 
DEU.29.19	When such a person hears the words of this oath and they invoke a blessing on themselves, thinking, “I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way,” they will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry. 
DEU.29.20	The 
DEU.29.21	The 
DEU.29.22	Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the 
DEU.29.23	The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur—nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it. It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, which the 
DEU.29.24	All the nations will ask: “Why has the 
DEU.29.25	And the answer will be: “It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the 
DEU.29.26	They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods he had not given them. 
DEU.29.27	Therefore the 
DEU.29.28	In furious anger and in great wrath the 
DEU.29.29	The secret things belong to the 
DEU.30.1	When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come on you and you take them to heart wherever the 
DEU.30.2	and when you and your children return to the 
DEU.30.3	then the 
DEU.30.4	Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the 
DEU.30.5	He will bring you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors. 
DEU.30.6	The 
DEU.30.7	The 
DEU.30.8	You will again obey the 
DEU.30.9	Then the 
DEU.30.10	if you obey the 
DEU.30.11	Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. 
DEU.30.12	It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, “Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?” 
DEU.30.13	Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, “Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?” 
DEU.30.14	No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.
DEU.30.15	See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction. 
DEU.30.16	For I command you today to love the 
DEU.30.17	But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them, 
DEU.30.18	I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.
DEU.30.19	This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live 
DEU.30.20	and that you may love the 
DEU.31.1	Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel: 
DEU.31.2	“I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you. The 
DEU.31.3	The 
DEU.31.4	And the 
DEU.31.5	The 
DEU.31.6	Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the 
DEU.31.7	Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that the 
DEU.31.8	The 
DEU.31.9	So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the Levitical priests, who carried the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.10	Then Moses commanded them: “At the end of every seven years, in the year for canceling debts, during the Festival of Tabernacles, 
DEU.31.11	when all Israel comes to appear before the 
DEU.31.12	Assemble the people—men, women and children, and the foreigners residing in your towns—so they can listen and learn to fear the 
DEU.31.13	Their children, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear the 
DEU.31.14	The 
DEU.31.15	Then the 
DEU.31.16	And the 
DEU.31.17	And in that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and calamities will come on them, and in that day they will ask, ‘Have not these disasters come on us because our God is not with us?’ 
DEU.31.18	And I will certainly hide my face in that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods.
DEU.31.19	“Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them. 
DEU.31.20	When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their ancestors, and when they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant. 
DEU.31.21	And when many disasters and calamities come on them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath.” 
DEU.31.22	So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.
DEU.31.23	The 
DEU.31.24	After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end, 
DEU.31.25	he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.26	“Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.27	For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the 
DEU.31.28	Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to testify against them. 
DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of the 
DEU.31.30	And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:
DEU.32.1	Listen, you heavens, and I will speak;
DEU.32.1	hear, you earth, the words of my mouth.
DEU.32.2	Let my teaching fall like rain
DEU.32.2	and my words descend like dew,
DEU.32.2	like showers on new grass,
DEU.32.2	like abundant rain on tender plants.
DEU.32.3	I will proclaim the name of the 
DEU.32.3	Oh, praise the greatness of our God!
DEU.32.4	He is the Rock, his works are perfect,
DEU.32.4	and all his ways are just.
DEU.32.4	A faithful God who does no wrong,
DEU.32.4	upright and just is he.
DEU.32.5	They are corrupt and not his children;
DEU.32.5	to their shame they are a warped and crooked generation.
DEU.32.6	Is this the way you repay the 
DEU.32.6	you foolish and unwise people?
DEU.32.6	Is he not your Father, your Creator,
DEU.32.6	who made you and formed you?
DEU.32.7	Remember the days of old;
DEU.32.7	consider the generations long past.
DEU.32.7	Ask your father and he will tell you,
DEU.32.7	your elders, and they will explain to you.
DEU.32.8	When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,
DEU.32.8	when he divided all mankind,
DEU.32.8	he set up boundaries for the peoples
DEU.32.8	according to the number of the sons of Israel.
DEU.32.9	For the 
DEU.32.9	Jacob his allotted inheritance.
DEU.32.10	In a desert land he found him,
DEU.32.10	in a barren and howling waste.
DEU.32.10	He shielded him and cared for him;
DEU.32.10	he guarded him as the apple of his eye,
DEU.32.11	like an eagle that stirs up its nest
DEU.32.11	and hovers over its young,
DEU.32.11	that spreads its wings to catch them
DEU.32.11	and carries them aloft.
DEU.32.12	The 
DEU.32.12	no foreign god was with him.
DEU.32.13	He made him ride on the heights of the land
DEU.32.13	and fed him with the fruit of the fields.
DEU.32.13	He nourished him with honey from the rock,
DEU.32.13	and with oil from the flinty crag,
DEU.32.14	with curds and milk from herd and flock
DEU.32.14	and with fattened lambs and goats,
DEU.32.14	with choice rams of Bashan
DEU.32.14	and the finest kernels of wheat.
DEU.32.14	You drank the foaming blood of the grape.
DEU.32.15	Jeshurun
DEU.32.15	filled with food, they became heavy and sleek.
DEU.32.15	They abandoned the God who made them
DEU.32.15	and rejected the Rock their Savior.
DEU.32.16	They made him jealous with their foreign gods
DEU.32.16	and angered him with their detestable idols.
DEU.32.17	They sacrificed to false gods, which are not God—
DEU.32.17	gods they had not known,
DEU.32.17	gods that recently appeared,
DEU.32.17	gods your ancestors did not fear.
DEU.32.18	You deserted the Rock, who fathered you;
DEU.32.18	you forgot the God who gave you birth.
DEU.32.19	The 
DEU.32.19	because he was angered by his sons and daughters.
DEU.32.20	“I will hide my face from them,” he said,
DEU.32.20	“and see what their end will be;
DEU.32.20	for they are a perverse generation,
DEU.32.20	children who are unfaithful.
DEU.32.21	They made me jealous by what is no god
DEU.32.21	and angered me with their worthless idols.
DEU.32.21	I will make them envious by those who are not a people;
DEU.32.21	I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding.
DEU.32.22	For a fire will be kindled by my wrath,
DEU.32.22	one that burns down to the realm of the dead below.
DEU.32.22	It will devour the earth and its harvests
DEU.32.22	and set afire the foundations of the mountains.
DEU.32.23	“I will heap calamities on them
DEU.32.23	and spend my arrows against them.
DEU.32.24	I will send wasting famine against them,
DEU.32.24	consuming pestilence and deadly plague;
DEU.32.24	I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts,
DEU.32.24	the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.
DEU.32.25	In the street the sword will make them childless;
DEU.32.25	in their homes terror will reign.
DEU.32.25	The young men and young women will perish,
DEU.32.25	the infants and those with gray hair.
DEU.32.26	I said I would scatter them
DEU.32.26	and erase their name from human memory,
DEU.32.27	but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy,
DEU.32.27	lest the adversary misunderstand
DEU.32.27	and say, ‘Our hand has triumphed;
DEU.32.27	the 
DEU.32.28	They are a nation without sense,
DEU.32.28	there is no discernment in them.
DEU.32.29	If only they were wise and would understand this
DEU.32.29	and discern what their end will be!
DEU.32.30	How could one man chase a thousand,
DEU.32.30	or two put ten thousand to flight,
DEU.32.30	unless their Rock had sold them,
DEU.32.30	unless the 
DEU.32.31	For their rock is not like our Rock,
DEU.32.31	as even our enemies concede.
DEU.32.32	Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom
DEU.32.32	and from the fields of Gomorrah.
DEU.32.32	Their grapes are filled with poison,
DEU.32.32	and their clusters with bitterness.
DEU.32.33	Their wine is the venom of serpents,
DEU.32.33	the deadly poison of cobras.
DEU.32.34	“Have I not kept this in reserve
DEU.32.34	and sealed it in my vaults?
DEU.32.35	It is mine to avenge; I will repay.
DEU.32.35	In due time their foot will slip;
DEU.32.35	their day of disaster is near
DEU.32.35	and their doom rushes upon them.”
DEU.32.36	The 
DEU.32.36	and relent concerning his servants
DEU.32.36	when he sees their strength is gone
DEU.32.36	and no one is left, slave or free.
DEU.32.37	He will say: “Now where are their gods,
DEU.32.37	the rock they took refuge in,
DEU.32.38	the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices
DEU.32.38	and drank the wine of their drink offerings?
DEU.32.38	Let them rise up to help you!
DEU.32.38	Let them give you shelter!
DEU.32.39	“See now that I myself am he!
DEU.32.39	There is no god besides me.
DEU.32.39	I put to death and I bring to life,
DEU.32.39	I have wounded and I will heal,
DEU.32.39	and no one can deliver out of my hand.
DEU.32.40	I lift my hand to heaven and solemnly swear:
DEU.32.40	As surely as I live forever,
DEU.32.41	when I sharpen my flashing sword
DEU.32.41	and my hand grasps it in judgment,
DEU.32.41	I will take vengeance on my adversaries
DEU.32.41	and repay those who hate me.
DEU.32.42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood,
DEU.32.42	while my sword devours flesh:
DEU.32.42	the blood of the slain and the captives,
DEU.32.42	the heads of the enemy leaders.”
DEU.32.43	Rejoice, you nations, with his people,
DEU.32.43	for he will avenge the blood of his servants;
DEU.32.43	he will take vengeance on his enemies
DEU.32.43	and make atonement for his land and people.
DEU.32.44	Moses came with Joshua
DEU.32.45	When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel, 
DEU.32.46	he said to them, “Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law. 
DEU.32.47	They are not just idle words for you—they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
DEU.32.48	On that same day the 
DEU.32.49	“Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession. 
DEU.32.50	There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people. 
DEU.32.51	This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites. 
DEU.32.52	Therefore, you will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel.”
DEU.33.1	This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced on the Israelites before his death. 
DEU.33.2	He said:
DEU.33.2	“The 
DEU.33.2	and dawned over them from Seir;
DEU.33.2	he shone forth from Mount Paran.
DEU.33.2	He came with
DEU.33.2	from the south, from his mountain slopes.
DEU.33.3	Surely it is you who love the people;
DEU.33.3	all the holy ones are in your hand.
DEU.33.3	At your feet they all bow down,
DEU.33.3	and from you receive instruction,
DEU.33.4	the law that Moses gave us,
DEU.33.4	the possession of the assembly of Jacob.
DEU.33.5	He was king over Jeshurun
DEU.33.5	when the leaders of the people assembled,
DEU.33.5	along with the tribes of Israel.
DEU.33.6	“Let Reuben live and not die,
DEU.33.6	nor
DEU.33.7	And this he said about Judah:
DEU.33.7	“Hear, 
DEU.33.7	bring him to his people.
DEU.33.7	With his own hands he defends his cause.
DEU.33.7	Oh, be his help against his foes!”
DEU.33.8	About Levi he said:
DEU.33.8	“Your Thummim and Urim belong
DEU.33.8	to your faithful servant.
DEU.33.8	You tested him at Massah;
DEU.33.8	you contended with him at the waters of Meribah.
DEU.33.9	He said of his father and mother,
DEU.33.9	‘I have no regard for them.’
DEU.33.9	He did not recognize his brothers
DEU.33.9	or acknowledge his own children,
DEU.33.9	but he watched over your word
DEU.33.9	and guarded your covenant.
DEU.33.10	He teaches your precepts to Jacob
DEU.33.10	and your law to Israel.
DEU.33.10	He offers incense before you
DEU.33.10	and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
DEU.33.11	Bless all his skills, 
DEU.33.11	and be pleased with the work of his hands.
DEU.33.11	Strike down those who rise against him,
DEU.33.11	his foes till they rise no more.”
DEU.33.12	About Benjamin he said:
DEU.33.12	“Let the beloved of the 
DEU.33.12	for he shields him all day long,
DEU.33.12	and the one the 
DEU.33.13	About Joseph he said:
DEU.33.13	“May the 
DEU.33.13	with the precious dew from heaven above
DEU.33.13	and with the deep waters that lie below;
DEU.33.14	with the best the sun brings forth
DEU.33.14	and the finest the moon can yield;
DEU.33.15	with the choicest gifts of the ancient mountains
DEU.33.15	and the fruitfulness of the everlasting hills;
DEU.33.16	with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness
DEU.33.16	and the favor of him who dwelt in the burning bush.
DEU.33.16	Let all these rest on the head of Joseph,
DEU.33.16	on the brow of the prince among
DEU.33.17	In majesty he is like a firstborn bull;
DEU.33.17	his horns are the horns of a wild ox.
DEU.33.17	With them he will gore the nations,
DEU.33.17	even those at the ends of the earth.
DEU.33.17	Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim;
DEU.33.17	such are the thousands of Manasseh.”
DEU.33.18	About Zebulun he said:
DEU.33.18	“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out,
DEU.33.18	and you, Issachar, in your tents.
DEU.33.19	They will summon peoples to the mountain
DEU.33.19	and there offer the sacrifices of the righteous;
DEU.33.19	they will feast on the abundance of the seas,
DEU.33.19	on the treasures hidden in the sand.”
DEU.33.20	About Gad he said:
DEU.33.20	“Blessed is he who enlarges Gad’s domain!
DEU.33.20	Gad lives there like a lion,
DEU.33.20	tearing at arm or head.
DEU.33.21	He chose the best land for himself;
DEU.33.21	the leader’s portion was kept for him.
DEU.33.21	When the heads of the people assembled,
DEU.33.21	he carried out the 
DEU.33.21	and his judgments concerning Israel.”
DEU.33.22	About Dan he said:
DEU.33.22	“Dan is a lion’s cub,
DEU.33.22	springing out of Bashan.”
DEU.33.23	About Naphtali he said:
DEU.33.23	“Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the 
DEU.33.23	and is full of his blessing;
DEU.33.23	he will inherit southward to the lake.”
DEU.33.24	About Asher he said:
DEU.33.24	“Most blessed of sons is Asher;
DEU.33.24	let him be favored by his brothers,
DEU.33.24	and let him bathe his feet in oil.
DEU.33.25	The bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze,
DEU.33.25	and your strength will equal your days.
DEU.33.26	“There is no one like the God of Jeshurun,
DEU.33.26	who rides across the heavens to help you
DEU.33.26	and on the clouds in his majesty.
DEU.33.27	The eternal God is your refuge,
DEU.33.27	and underneath are the everlasting arms.
DEU.33.27	He will drive out your enemies before you,
DEU.33.27	saying, ‘Destroy them!’
DEU.33.28	So Israel will live in safety;
DEU.33.28	Jacob will dwell
DEU.33.28	in a land of grain and new wine,
DEU.33.28	where the heavens drop dew.
DEU.33.29	Blessed are you, Israel!
DEU.33.29	Who is like you,
DEU.33.29	a people saved by the 
DEU.33.29	He is your shield and helper
DEU.33.29	and your glorious sword.
DEU.33.29	Your enemies will cower before you,
DEU.33.29	and you will tread on their heights.”
DEU.34.1	Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the 
DEU.34.2	all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea, 
DEU.34.3	the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar. 
DEU.34.4	Then the 
DEU.34.5	And Moses the servant of the 
DEU.34.6	He buried him
DEU.34.7	Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone. 
DEU.34.8	The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.
DEU.34.9	Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit
DEU.34.10	Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the 
DEU.34.11	who did all those signs and wonders the 
DEU.34.12	For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	After the death of Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.2	“Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them—to the Israelites. 
JOS.1.3	I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses. 
JOS.1.4	Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates—all the Hittite country—to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
JOS.1.5	No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you. 
JOS.1.6	Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.
JOS.1.7	“Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go. 
JOS.1.8	Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful. 
JOS.1.9	Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the 
JOS.1.10	So Joshua ordered the officers of the people: 
JOS.1.11	“Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Get your provisions ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the 
JOS.1.12	But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, 
JOS.1.13	“Remember the command that Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, ready for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites. You are to help them 
JOS.1.15	until the 
JOS.1.16	Then they answered Joshua, “Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 
JOS.1.17	Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the 
JOS.1.18	Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey it, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!”
JOS.2.1	Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. “Go, look over the land,” he said, “especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
JOS.2.2	The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.” 
JOS.2.3	So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.”
JOS.2.4	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from. 
JOS.2.5	At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left. I don’t know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.” 
JOS.2.6	(But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.) 
JOS.2.7	So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.
JOS.2.8	Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof 
JOS.2.9	and said to them, “I know that the 
JOS.2.10	We have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the 
JOS.2.12	“Now then, please swear to me by the 
JOS.2.13	that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them—and that you will save us from death.”
JOS.2.14	“Our lives for your lives!” the men assured her. “If you don’t tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the 
JOS.2.15	So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall. 
JOS.2.16	She said to them, “Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way.”
JOS.2.17	Now the men had said to her, “This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us 
JOS.2.18	unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house. 
JOS.2.19	If any of them go outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own heads; we will not be responsible. As for those who are in the house with you, their blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on them. 
JOS.2.20	But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.”
JOS.2.21	“Agreed,” she replied. “Let it be as you say.”
JOS.2.21	So she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
JOS.2.22	When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them. 
JOS.2.23	Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them. 
JOS.2.24	They said to Joshua, “The 
JOS.3.1	Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over. 
JOS.3.2	After three days the officers went throughout the camp, 
JOS.3.3	giving orders to the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.3.4	Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits
JOS.3.5	Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the 
JOS.3.6	Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people.” So they took it up and went ahead of them.
JOS.3.7	And the 
JOS.3.8	Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the Jordan’s waters, go and stand in the river.’ ”
JOS.3.9	Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the 
JOS.3.10	This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites. 
JOS.3.11	See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you. 
JOS.3.12	Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. 
JOS.3.13	And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the 
JOS.3.14	So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them. 
JOS.3.15	Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge, 
JOS.3.16	the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho. 
JOS.3.17	The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.1	When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the 
JOS.4.2	“Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe, 
JOS.4.3	and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from right where the priests are standing, and carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight.”
JOS.4.4	So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe, 
JOS.4.5	and said to them, “Go over before the ark of the 
JOS.4.6	to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, ‘What do these stones mean?’ 
JOS.4.7	tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.8	So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the 
JOS.4.9	Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been
JOS.4.10	Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the 
JOS.4.11	and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the 
JOS.4.12	The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, ready for battle, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them. 
JOS.4.13	About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the 
JOS.4.14	That day the 
JOS.4.15	Then the 
JOS.4.16	“Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant law to come up out of the Jordan.”
JOS.4.17	So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.”
JOS.4.18	And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.19	On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho. 
JOS.4.20	And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan. 
JOS.4.21	He said to the Israelites, “In the future when your descendants ask their parents, ‘What do these stones mean?’ 
JOS.4.22	tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’ 
JOS.4.23	For the 
JOS.4.24	He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the 
JOS.5.1	Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the 
JOS.5.2	At that time the 
JOS.5.3	So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.
JOS.5.4	Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt—all the men of military age—died in the wilderness on the way after leaving Egypt. 
JOS.5.5	All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness during the journey from Egypt had not. 
JOS.5.6	The Israelites had moved about in the wilderness forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the 
JOS.5.7	So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way. 
JOS.5.8	And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.
JOS.5.9	Then the 
JOS.5.10	On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover. 
JOS.5.11	The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain. 
JOS.5.12	The manna stopped the day after
JOS.5.13	Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, “Are you for us or for our enemies?”
JOS.5.14	“Neither,” he replied, “but as commander of the army of the 
JOS.5.15	The commander of the 
JOS.6.1	Now the gates of Jericho were securely barred because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.
JOS.6.2	Then the 
JOS.6.3	March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. 
JOS.6.4	Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. 
JOS.6.5	When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in.”
JOS.6.6	So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.6.7	And he ordered the army, “Advance! March around the city, with an armed guard going ahead of the ark of the 
JOS.6.8	When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the 
JOS.6.9	The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding. 
JOS.6.10	But Joshua had commanded the army, “Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!” 
JOS.6.11	So he had the ark of the 
JOS.6.12	Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the 
JOS.6.13	The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the 
JOS.6.14	So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
JOS.6.15	On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the army, “Shout! For the 
JOS.6.17	The city and all that is in it are to be devoted
JOS.6.18	But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it. 
JOS.6.19	All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the 
JOS.6.20	When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so everyone charged straight in, and they took the city. 
JOS.6.21	They devoted the city to the 
JOS.6.22	Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her.” 
JOS.6.23	So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother, her brothers and sisters and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.
JOS.6.24	Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the 
JOS.6.25	But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho—and she lives among the Israelites to this day.
JOS.6.26	At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: “Cursed before the 
JOS.6.26	“At the cost of his firstborn son
JOS.6.26	he will lay its foundations;
JOS.6.26	at the cost of his youngest
JOS.6.26	he will set up its gates.”
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	But the Israelites were unfaithful in regard to the devoted things
JOS.7.2	Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the region.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.
JOS.7.3	When they returned to Joshua, they said, “Not all the army will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary the whole army, for only a few people live there.” 
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai, 
JOS.7.5	who killed about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted in fear and became like water.
JOS.7.6	Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the 
JOS.7.7	And Joshua said, “Alas, Sovereign 
JOS.7.8	Pardon your servant, Lord. What can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies? 
JOS.7.9	The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name?”
JOS.7.10	The 
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions. 
JOS.7.12	That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.
JOS.7.13	“Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the 
JOS.7.14	“ ‘In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the 
JOS.7.15	Whoever is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the 
JOS.7.16	Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was chosen. 
JOS.7.17	The clans of Judah came forward, and the Zerahites were chosen. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was chosen. 
JOS.7.18	Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was chosen.
JOS.7.19	Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the 
JOS.7.20	Achan replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia,
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. 
JOS.7.23	They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the 
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor. 
JOS.7.25	Joshua said, “Why have you brought this trouble on us? The 
JOS.7.25	Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them. 
JOS.7.26	Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the 
JOS.8.1	Then the 
JOS.8.2	You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.”
JOS.8.3	So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night 
JOS.8.4	with these orders: “Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don’t go very far from it. All of you be on the alert. 
JOS.8.5	I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them. 
JOS.8.6	They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are running away from us as they did before.’ So when we flee from them, 
JOS.8.7	you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The 
JOS.8.8	When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the 
JOS.8.9	Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai—but Joshua spent that night with the people.
JOS.8.10	Early the next morning Joshua mustered his army, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city. 
JOS.8.12	Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. 
JOS.8.13	So the soldiers took up their positions—with the main camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley.
JOS.8.14	When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city. 
JOS.8.15	Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the wilderness. 
JOS.8.16	All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel.
JOS.8.18	Then the 
JOS.8.19	As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.
JOS.8.20	The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising up into the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction; the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the wilderness had turned back against their pursuers. 
JOS.8.21	For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from it, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	Those in the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives. 
JOS.8.23	But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it. 
JOS.8.25	Twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai. 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed
JOS.8.27	But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the 
JOS.8.28	So Joshua burned Ai
JOS.8.29	He impaled the body of the king of Ai on a pole and left it there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take the body from the pole and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day.
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the 
JOS.8.31	as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.8.32	There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the law of Moses. 
JOS.8.33	All the Israelites, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.8.34	Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—just as it is written in the Book of the Law. 
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the foreigners who lived among them.
JOS.9.1	Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things—the kings in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Mediterranean Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites)— 
JOS.9.2	they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel.
JOS.9.3	However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
JOS.9.4	they resorted to a ruse: They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded
JOS.9.5	They put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy. 
JOS.9.6	Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the Israelites, “We have come from a distant country; make a treaty with us.”
JOS.9.7	The Israelites said to the Hivites, “But perhaps you live near us, so how can we make a treaty with you?”
JOS.9.8	“We are your servants,” they said to Joshua.
JOS.9.8	But Joshua asked, “Who are you and where do you come from?”
JOS.9.9	They answered: “Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the 
JOS.9.10	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, “We are your servants; make a treaty with us.” ’ 
JOS.9.12	This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is. 
JOS.9.13	And these wineskins that we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey.”
JOS.9.14	The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the 
JOS.9.15	Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.
JOS.9.16	Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard that they were neighbors, living near them. 
JOS.9.17	So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim. 
JOS.9.18	But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the 
JOS.9.18	The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders, 
JOS.9.19	but all the leaders answered, “We have given them our oath by the 
JOS.9.20	This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that God’s wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them.” 
JOS.9.21	They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers in the service of the whole assembly.” So the leaders’ promise to them was kept.
JOS.9.22	Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by saying, ‘We live a long way from you,’ while actually you live near us? 
JOS.9.23	You are now under a curse: You will never be released from service as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
JOS.9.24	They answered Joshua, “Your servants were clearly told how the 
JOS.9.25	We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.”
JOS.9.26	So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them. 
JOS.9.27	That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the assembly, to provide for the needs of the altar of the 
JOS.10.1	Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed
JOS.10.2	He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters. 
JOS.10.3	So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon. 
JOS.10.4	“Come up and help me attack Gibeon,” he said, “because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”
JOS.10.5	Then the five kings of the Amorites—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon—joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.
JOS.10.6	The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: “Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us.”
JOS.10.7	So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men. 
JOS.10.8	The 
JOS.10.9	After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise. 
JOS.10.10	The 
JOS.10.11	As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the 
JOS.10.12	On the day the 
JOS.10.12	“Sun, stand still over Gibeon,
JOS.10.12	and you, moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”
JOS.10.13	So the sun stood still,
JOS.10.13	and the moon stopped,
JOS.10.13	till the nation avenged itself on
JOS.10.13	as it is written in the Book of Jashar.
JOS.10.13	The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day. 
JOS.10.14	There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the 
JOS.10.15	Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah, 
JOS.10.18	he said, “Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it. 
JOS.10.19	But don’t stop; pursue your enemies! Attack them from the rear and don’t let them reach their cities, for the 
JOS.10.20	So Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely, but a few survivors managed to reach their fortified cities. 
JOS.10.21	The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites.
JOS.10.22	Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.” 
JOS.10.23	So they brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.
JOS.10.25	Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the 
JOS.10.26	Then Joshua put the kings to death and exposed their bodies on five poles, and they were left hanging on the poles until evening.
JOS.10.27	At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the poles and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding. At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks, which are there to this day.
JOS.10.28	That day Joshua took Makkedah. He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
JOS.10.29	Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it. 
JOS.10.30	The 
JOS.10.31	Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it. 
JOS.10.32	The 
JOS.10.33	Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army—until no survivors were left.
JOS.10.34	Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it. 
JOS.10.35	They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish.
JOS.10.36	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it. 
JOS.10.37	They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it.
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir. 
JOS.10.39	They took the city, its king and its villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron.
JOS.10.40	So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings. He left no survivors. He totally destroyed all who breathed, just as the 
JOS.10.41	Joshua subdued them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza and from the whole region of Goshen to Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	All these kings and their lands Joshua conquered in one campaign, because the 
JOS.10.43	Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the kings of Shimron and Akshaph, 
JOS.11.2	and to the northern kings who were in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Kinnereth, in the western foothills and in Naphoth Dor on the west; 
JOS.11.3	to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites below Hermon in the region of Mizpah. 
JOS.11.4	They came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariots—a huge army, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. 
JOS.11.5	All these kings joined forces and made camp together at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
JOS.11.6	The 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them, 
JOS.11.8	and the 
JOS.11.9	Joshua did to them as the 
JOS.11.10	At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword. (Hazor had been the head of all these kingdoms.) 
JOS.11.11	Everyone in it they put to the sword. They totally destroyed
JOS.11.12	Joshua took all these royal cities and their kings and put them to the sword. He totally destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.11.13	Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds—except Hazor, which Joshua burned. 
JOS.11.14	The Israelites carried off for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but all the people they put to the sword until they completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone that breathed. 
JOS.11.15	As the 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua took this entire land: the hill country, all the Negev, the whole region of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah and the mountains of Israel with their foothills, 
JOS.11.17	from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and put them to death. 
JOS.11.18	Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time. 
JOS.11.19	Except for the Hivites living in Gibeon, not one city made a treaty of peace with the Israelites, who took them all in battle. 
JOS.11.20	For it was the 
JOS.11.21	At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites from the hill country: from Hebron, Debir and Anab, from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua totally destroyed them and their towns. 
JOS.11.22	No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod did any survive.
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the entire land, just as the 
JOS.12.1	These are the kings of the land whom the Israelites had defeated and whose territory they took over east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon, including all the eastern side of the Arabah:
JOS.12.2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.
JOS.12.2	He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge—from the middle of the gorge—to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites. This included half of Gilead. 
JOS.12.3	He also ruled over the eastern Arabah from the Sea of Galilee
JOS.12.4	And the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaites, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
JOS.12.5	He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salekah, all of Bashan to the border of the people of Geshur and Maakah, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
JOS.12.6	Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.12.7	Here is a list of the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites conquered on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir. Joshua gave their lands as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel according to their tribal divisions. 
JOS.12.8	The lands included the hill country, the western foothills, the Arabah, the mountain slopes, the wilderness and the Negev. These were the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. These were the kings:

JOS.12.24	one
JOS.12.24	thirty-one kings in all.
JOS.13.1	When Joshua had grown old, the 
JOS.13.2	“This is the land that remains: All the regions of the Philistines and Geshurites, 
JOS.13.3	from the Shihor River on the east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north, all of it counted as Canaanite though held by the five Philistine rulers in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron; the territory of the Avvites 
JOS.13.4	on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, from Arah of the Sidonians as far as Aphek and the border of the Amorites; 
JOS.13.5	the area of Byblos; and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
JOS.13.6	“As for all the inhabitants of the mountain regions from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, that is, all the Sidonians, I myself will drive them out before the Israelites. Be sure to allocate this land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have instructed you, 
JOS.13.7	and divide it as an inheritance among the nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh.”
JOS.13.8	The other half of Manasseh,
JOS.13.9	It extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and included the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon, 
JOS.13.10	and all the towns of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, out to the border of the Ammonites. 
JOS.13.11	It also included Gilead, the territory of the people of Geshur and Maakah, all of Mount Hermon and all Bashan as far as Salekah— 
JOS.13.12	that is, the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. (He was the last of the Rephaites.) Moses had defeated them and taken over their land. 
JOS.13.13	But the Israelites did not drive out the people of Geshur and Maakah, so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day.
JOS.13.14	But to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance, since the food offerings presented to the 
JOS.13.15	This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Reuben, according to its clans:
JOS.13.16	The territory from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and the whole plateau past Medeba 
JOS.13.17	to Heshbon and all its towns on the plateau, including Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon, 
JOS.13.18	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley, 
JOS.13.20	Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth— 
JOS.13.21	all the towns on the plateau and the entire realm of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled at Heshbon. Moses had defeated him and the Midianite chiefs, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—princes allied with Sihon—who lived in that country. 
JOS.13.22	In addition to those slain in battle, the Israelites had put to the sword Balaam son of Beor, who practiced divination. 
JOS.13.23	The boundary of the Reubenites was the bank of the Jordan. These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the Reubenites, according to their clans.
JOS.13.24	This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Gad, according to its clans:
JOS.13.25	The territory of Jazer, all the towns of Gilead and half the Ammonite country as far as Aroer, near Rabbah; 
JOS.13.26	and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir; 
JOS.13.27	and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Sukkoth and Zaphon with the rest of the realm of Sihon king of Heshbon (the east side of the Jordan, the territory up to the end of the Sea of Galilee
JOS.13.28	These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the Gadites, according to their clans.
JOS.13.29	This is what Moses had given to the half-tribe of Manasseh, that is, to half the family of the descendants of Manasseh, according to its clans:
JOS.13.30	The territory extending from Mahanaim and including all of Bashan, the entire realm of Og king of Bashan—all the settlements of Jair in Bashan, sixty towns, 
JOS.13.31	half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei (the royal cities of Og in Bashan). This was for the descendants of Makir son of Manasseh—for half of the sons of Makir, according to their clans.
JOS.13.32	This is the inheritance Moses had given when he was in the plains of Moab across the Jordan east of Jericho. 
JOS.13.33	But to the tribe of Levi, Moses had given no inheritance; the 
JOS.14.1	Now these are the areas the Israelites received as an inheritance in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel allotted to them. 
JOS.14.2	Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine-and-a-half tribes, as the 
JOS.14.3	Moses had granted the two-and-a-half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest, 
JOS.14.4	for Joseph’s descendants had become two tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds. 
JOS.14.5	So the Israelites divided the land, just as the 
JOS.14.6	Now the people of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the 
JOS.14.7	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the 
JOS.14.8	but my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt in fear. I, however, followed the 
JOS.14.9	So on that day Moses swore to me, ‘The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the 
JOS.14.10	“Now then, just as the 
JOS.14.11	I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I’m just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then. 
JOS.14.12	Now give me this hill country that the 
JOS.14.13	Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance. 
JOS.14.14	So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the 
JOS.14.15	(Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba after Arba, who was the greatest man among the Anakites.)
JOS.14.15	Then the land had rest from war.
JOS.15.1	The allotment for the tribe of Judah, according to its clans, extended down to the territory of Edom, to the Desert of Zin in the extreme south.
JOS.15.2	Their southern boundary started from the bay at the southern end of the Dead Sea, 
JOS.15.3	crossed south of Scorpion Pass, continued on to Zin and went over to the south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it ran past Hezron up to Addar and curved around to Karka. 
JOS.15.4	It then passed along to Azmon and joined the Wadi of Egypt, ending at the Mediterranean Sea. This is their
JOS.15.5	The eastern boundary is the Dead Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan.
JOS.15.5	The northern boundary started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan, 
JOS.15.6	went up to Beth Hoglah and continued north of Beth Arabah to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 
JOS.15.7	The boundary then went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor and turned north to Gilgal, which faces the Pass of Adummim south of the gorge. It continued along to the waters of En Shemesh and came out at En Rogel. 
JOS.15.8	Then it ran up the Valley of Ben Hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem). From there it climbed to the top of the hill west of the Hinnom Valley at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. 
JOS.15.9	From the hilltop the boundary headed toward the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, came out at the towns of Mount Ephron and went down toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim). 
JOS.15.10	Then it curved westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Kesalon), continued down to Beth Shemesh and crossed to Timnah. 
JOS.15.11	It went to the northern slope of Ekron, turned toward Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah and reached Jabneel. The boundary ended at the sea.
JOS.15.12	The western boundary is the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.12	These are the boundaries around the people of Judah by their clans.
JOS.15.13	In accordance with the 
JOS.15.14	From Hebron Caleb drove out the three Anakites—Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai, the sons of Anak. 
JOS.15.15	From there he marched against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher). 
JOS.15.16	And Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.” 
JOS.15.17	Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage.
JOS.15.18	One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him
JOS.15.19	She replied, “Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
JOS.15.20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of Judah, according to its clans:
JOS.15.21	The southernmost towns of the tribe of Judah in the Negev toward the boundary of Edom were:
JOS.15.21	Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 
JOS.15.22	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 
JOS.15.23	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, 
JOS.15.24	Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, 
JOS.15.25	Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (that is, Hazor), 
JOS.15.26	Amam, Shema, Moladah, 
JOS.15.27	Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth Pelet, 
JOS.15.28	Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah, 
JOS.15.29	Baalah, Iyim, Ezem, 
JOS.15.30	Eltolad, Kesil, Hormah, 
JOS.15.31	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 
JOS.15.32	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain and Rimmon—a total of twenty-nine towns and their villages.
JOS.15.33	In the western foothills:
JOS.15.33	Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, 
JOS.15.34	Zanoah, En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam, 
JOS.15.35	Jarmuth, Adullam, Sokoh, Azekah, 
JOS.15.36	Shaaraim, Adithaim and Gederah (or Gederothaim)
JOS.15.37	Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal Gad, 
JOS.15.38	Dilean, Mizpah, Joktheel, 
JOS.15.39	Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, 
JOS.15.40	Kabbon, Lahmas, Kitlish, 
JOS.15.41	Gederoth, Beth Dagon, Naamah and Makkedah—sixteen towns and their villages.
JOS.15.42	Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 
JOS.15.43	Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 
JOS.15.44	Keilah, Akzib and Mareshah—nine towns and their villages.
JOS.15.45	Ekron, with its surrounding settlements and villages; 
JOS.15.46	west of Ekron, all that were in the vicinity of Ashdod, together with their villages; 
JOS.15.47	Ashdod, its surrounding settlements and villages; and Gaza, its settlements and villages, as far as the Wadi of Egypt and the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.48	In the hill country:
JOS.15.48	Shamir, Jattir, Sokoh, 
JOS.15.49	Dannah, Kiriath Sannah (that is, Debir), 
JOS.15.50	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, 
JOS.15.51	Goshen, Holon and Giloh—eleven towns and their villages.
JOS.15.52	Arab, Dumah, Eshan, 
JOS.15.53	Janim, Beth Tappuah, Aphekah, 
JOS.15.54	Humtah, Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) and Zior—nine towns and their villages.
JOS.15.55	Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, 
JOS.15.56	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 
JOS.15.57	Kain, Gibeah and Timnah—ten towns and their villages.
JOS.15.58	Halhul, Beth Zur, Gedor, 
JOS.15.59	Maarath, Beth Anoth and Eltekon—six towns and their villages.
JOS.15.60	Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim) and Rabbah—two towns and their villages.
JOS.15.61	In the wilderness:
JOS.15.61	Beth Arabah, Middin, Sekakah, 
JOS.15.62	Nibshan, the City of Salt and En Gedi—six towns and their villages.
JOS.15.63	Judah could not dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the people of Judah.
JOS.16.1	The allotment for Joseph began at the Jordan, east of the springs of Jericho, and went up from there through the desert into the hill country of Bethel. 
JOS.16.2	It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz),
JOS.16.3	descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.16.4	So Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their inheritance.
JOS.16.5	This was the territory of Ephraim, according to its clans:
JOS.16.5	The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon 
JOS.16.6	and continued to the Mediterranean Sea. From Mikmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by it to Janoah on the east. 
JOS.16.7	Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan. 
JOS.16.8	From Tappuah the border went west to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites, according to its clans. 
JOS.16.9	It also included all the towns and their villages that were set aside for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites.
JOS.16.10	They did not dislodge the Canaanites living in Gezer; to this day the Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are required to do forced labor.
JOS.17.1	This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph’s firstborn, that is, for Makir, Manasseh’s firstborn. Makir was the ancestor of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because the Makirites were great soldiers. 
JOS.17.2	So this allotment was for the rest of the people of Manasseh—the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans.
JOS.17.3	Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah. 
JOS.17.4	They went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders and said, “The 
JOS.17.5	Manasseh’s share consisted of ten tracts of land besides Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan, 
JOS.17.6	because the daughters of the tribe of Manasseh received an inheritance among the sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.
JOS.17.7	The territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Mikmethath east of Shechem. The boundary ran southward from there to include the people living at En Tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	(Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah itself, on the boundary of Manasseh, belonged to the Ephraimites.) 
JOS.17.9	Then the boundary continued south to the Kanah Ravine. There were towns belonging to Ephraim lying among the towns of Manasseh, but the boundary of Manasseh was the northern side of the ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. 
JOS.17.10	On the south the land belonged to Ephraim, on the north to Manasseh. The territory of Manasseh reached the Mediterranean Sea and bordered Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.
JOS.17.11	Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh also had Beth Shan, Ibleam and the people of Dor, Endor, Taanach and Megiddo, together with their surrounding settlements (the third in the list is Naphoth
JOS.17.12	Yet the Manassites were not able to occupy these towns, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that region. 
JOS.17.13	However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely.
JOS.17.14	The people of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance? We are a numerous people, and the 
JOS.17.15	“If you are so numerous,” Joshua answered, “and if the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go up into the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaites.”
JOS.17.16	The people of Joseph replied, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the plain have chariots fitted with iron, both those in Beth Shan and its settlements and those in the Valley of Jezreel.”
JOS.17.17	But Joshua said to the tribes of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—“You are numerous and very powerful. You will have not only one allotment 
JOS.17.18	but the forested hill country as well. Clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours; though the Canaanites have chariots fitted with iron and though they are strong, you can drive them out.”
JOS.18.1	The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The country was brought under their control, 
JOS.18.2	but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance.
JOS.18.3	So Joshua said to the Israelites: “How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the 
JOS.18.4	Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me. 
JOS.18.5	You are to divide the land into seven parts. Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the tribes of Joseph in their territory on the north. 
JOS.18.6	After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the 
JOS.18.7	The Levites, however, do not get a portion among you, because the priestly service of the 
JOS.18.8	As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed them, “Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the 
JOS.18.9	So the men left and went through the land. They wrote its description on a scroll, town by town, in seven parts, and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the 
JOS.18.11	The first lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin according to its clans. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph:
JOS.18.12	On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan, passed the northern slope of Jericho and headed west into the hill country, coming out at the wilderness of Beth Aven. 
JOS.18.13	From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.
JOS.18.14	From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah. This was the western side.
JOS.18.15	The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west, and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. 
JOS.18.16	The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel. 
JOS.18.17	It then curved north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which faces the Pass of Adummim, and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 
JOS.18.18	It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah
JOS.18.19	It then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Dead Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary.
JOS.18.20	The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side.
JOS.18.20	These were the boundaries that marked out the inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides.
JOS.18.21	The tribe of Benjamin, according to its clans, had the following towns:
JOS.18.21	Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,

JOS.18.28	Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriath—fourteen towns and their villages.
JOS.18.28	This was the inheritance of Benjamin for its clans.
JOS.19.1	The second lot came out for the tribe of Simeon according to its clans. Their inheritance lay within the territory of Judah. 
JOS.19.2	It included:

JOS.19.7	Ain, Rimmon, Ether and Ashan—four towns and their villages— 
JOS.19.8	and all the villages around these towns as far as Baalath Beer (Ramah in the Negev).
JOS.19.8	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Simeonites, according to its clans. 
JOS.19.9	The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from the share of Judah, because Judah’s portion was more than they needed. So the Simeonites received their inheritance within the territory of Judah.
JOS.19.10	The third lot came up for Zebulun according to its clans:
JOS.19.10	The boundary of their inheritance went as far as Sarid. 
JOS.19.11	Going west it ran to Maralah, touched Dabbesheth, and extended to the ravine near Jokneam. 
JOS.19.12	It turned east from Sarid toward the sunrise to the territory of Kisloth Tabor and went on to Daberath and up to Japhia. 
JOS.19.13	Then it continued eastward to Gath Hepher and Eth Kazin; it came out at Rimmon and turned toward Neah. 
JOS.19.14	There the boundary went around on the north to Hannathon and ended at the Valley of Iphtah El. 
JOS.19.15	Included were Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah and Bethlehem. There were twelve towns and their villages.
JOS.19.16	These towns and their villages were the inheritance of Zebulun, according to its clans.
JOS.19.17	The fourth lot came out for Issachar according to its clans. 
JOS.19.18	Their territory included:
JOS.19.18	Jezreel, Kesulloth, Shunem,

JOS.19.22	The boundary touched Tabor, Shahazumah and Beth Shemesh, and ended at the Jordan. There were sixteen towns and their villages.
JOS.19.23	These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar, according to its clans.

JOS.19.25	Their territory included:

JOS.19.26	Allammelek, Amad and Mishal. On the west the boundary touched Carmel and Shihor Libnath. 
JOS.19.27	It then turned east toward Beth Dagon, touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah El, and went north to Beth Emek and Neiel, passing Kabul on the left. 
JOS.19.28	It went to Abdon,
JOS.19.29	The boundary then turned back toward Ramah and went to the fortified city of Tyre, turned toward Hosah and came out at the Mediterranean Sea in the region of Akzib, 
JOS.19.30	Ummah, Aphek and Rehob. There were twenty-two towns and their villages.
JOS.19.31	These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Asher, according to its clans.
JOS.19.32	The sixth lot came out for Naphtali according to its clans:
JOS.19.33	Their boundary went from Heleph and the large tree in Zaanannim, passing Adami Nekeb and Jabneel to Lakkum and ending at the Jordan. 
JOS.19.34	The boundary ran west through Aznoth Tabor and came out at Hukkok. It touched Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west and the Jordan
JOS.19.35	The fortified towns were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth, 
JOS.19.36	Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
JOS.19.37	Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor, 
JOS.19.38	Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath and Beth Shemesh. There were nineteen towns and their villages.
JOS.19.39	These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali, according to its clans.
JOS.19.40	The seventh lot came out for the tribe of Dan according to its clans. 
JOS.19.41	The territory of their inheritance included:
JOS.19.41	Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh, 
JOS.19.42	Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 
JOS.19.43	Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
JOS.19.44	Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
JOS.19.45	Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon, 
JOS.19.46	Me Jarkon and Rakkon, with the area facing Joppa.
JOS.19.47	(When the territory of the Danites was lost to them, they went up and attacked Leshem, took it, put it to the sword and occupied it. They settled in Leshem and named it Dan after their ancestor.)
JOS.19.48	These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, according to its clans.
JOS.19.49	When they had finished dividing the land into its allotted portions, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them, 
JOS.19.50	as the 
JOS.19.51	These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel assigned by lot at Shiloh in the presence of the 
JOS.20.1	Then the 
JOS.20.2	“Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses, 
JOS.20.3	so that anyone who kills a person accidentally and unintentionally may flee there and find protection from the avenger of blood. 
JOS.20.4	When they flee to one of these cities, they are to stand in the entrance of the city gate and state their case before the elders of that city. Then the elders are to admit the fugitive into their city and provide a place to live among them. 
JOS.20.5	If the avenger of blood comes in pursuit, the elders must not surrender the fugitive, because the fugitive killed their neighbor unintentionally and without malice aforethought. 
JOS.20.6	They are to stay in that city until they have stood trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Then they may go back to their own home in the town from which they fled.”
JOS.20.7	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 
JOS.20.8	East of the Jordan (on the other side from Jericho) they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau in the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead in the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan in the tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.20.9	Any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing among them who killed someone accidentally could flee to these designated cities and not be killed by the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.
JOS.21.1	Now the family heads of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the other tribal families of Israel 
JOS.21.2	at Shiloh in Canaan and said to them, “The 
JOS.21.3	So, as the 
JOS.21.4	The first lot came out for the Kohathites, according to their clans. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest were allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon and Benjamin. 
JOS.21.5	The rest of Kohath’s descendants were allotted ten towns from the clans of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan and half of Manasseh.
JOS.21.6	The descendants of Gershon were allotted thirteen towns from the clans of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
JOS.21.7	The descendants of Merari, according to their clans, received twelve towns from the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Zebulun.
JOS.21.8	So the Israelites allotted to the Levites these towns and their pasturelands, as the 
JOS.21.9	From the tribes of Judah and Simeon they allotted the following towns by name 
JOS.21.10	(these towns were assigned to the descendants of Aaron who were from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because the first lot fell to them):
JOS.21.11	They gave them Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), with its surrounding pastureland, in the hill country of Judah. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.) 
JOS.21.12	But the fields and villages around the city they had given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
JOS.21.13	So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Libnah, 
JOS.21.14	Jattir, Eshtemoa, 
JOS.21.15	Holon, Debir, 
JOS.21.16	Ain, Juttah and Beth Shemesh, together with their pasturelands—nine towns from these two tribes.
JOS.21.17	And from the tribe of Benjamin they gave them: Gibeon, Geba, 
JOS.21.18	Anathoth and Almon, together with their pasturelands—four towns.
JOS.21.19	The total number of towns for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, came to thirteen, together with their pasturelands.
JOS.21.20	The rest of the Kohathite clans of the Levites were allotted towns from the tribe of Ephraim:
JOS.21.21	In the hill country of Ephraim they were given Shechem (a city of refuge for one accused of murder) and Gezer, 
JOS.21.22	Kibzaim and Beth Horon, together with their pasturelands—four towns.
JOS.21.23	Also from the tribe of Dan they received: Eltekeh, Gibbethon, 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon and Gath Rimmon, together with their pasturelands—four towns.
JOS.21.25	From half the tribe of Manasseh they received: Taanach and Gath Rimmon, together with their pasturelands—two towns.
JOS.21.26	All these ten towns and their pasturelands were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans.
JOS.21.27	The Levite clans of the Gershonites were given:
JOS.21.27	from the half-tribe of Manasseh,
JOS.21.27	Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge for one accused of murder) and Be Eshterah, together with their pasturelands—two towns;
JOS.21.28	from the tribe of Issachar,
JOS.21.28	Kishion, Daberath, 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth and En Gannim, together with their pasturelands—four towns;
JOS.21.30	from the tribe of Asher,
JOS.21.30	Mishal, Abdon, 
JOS.21.31	Helkath and Rehob, together with their pasturelands—four towns;
JOS.21.32	from the tribe of Naphtali,
JOS.21.32	Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Hammoth Dor and Kartan, together with their pasturelands—three towns.
JOS.21.33	The total number of towns of the Gershonite clans came to thirteen, together with their pasturelands.
JOS.21.34	The Merarite clans (the rest of the Levites) were given:
JOS.21.34	from the tribe of Zebulun,
JOS.21.34	Jokneam, Kartah, 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah and Nahalal, together with their pasturelands—four towns;
JOS.21.36	from the tribe of Reuben,
JOS.21.36	Bezer, Jahaz, 
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth and Mephaath, together with their pasturelands—four towns;
JOS.21.38	from the tribe of Gad,
JOS.21.38	Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Mahanaim, 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon and Jazer, together with their pasturelands—four towns in all.
JOS.21.40	The total number of towns allotted to the Merarite clans, who were the rest of the Levites, came to twelve.
JOS.21.41	The towns of the Levites in the territory held by the Israelites were forty-eight in all, together with their pasturelands. 
JOS.21.42	Each of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it; this was true for all these towns.
JOS.21.43	So the 
JOS.21.44	The 
JOS.21.45	Not one of all the 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh 
JOS.22.2	and said to them, “You have done all that Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.3	For a long time now—to this very day—you have not deserted your fellow Israelites but have carried out the mission the 
JOS.22.4	Now that the 
JOS.22.5	But be very careful to keep the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.6	Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their homes. 
JOS.22.7	(To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half of the tribe Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan along with their fellow Israelites.) When Joshua sent them home, he blessed them, 
JOS.22.8	saying, “Return to your homes with your great wealth—with large herds of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze and iron, and a great quantity of clothing—and divide the plunder from your enemies with your fellow Israelites.”
JOS.22.9	So the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead, their own land, which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the 
JOS.22.10	When they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan. 
JOS.22.11	And when the Israelites heard that they had built the altar on the border of Canaan at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side, 
JOS.22.12	the whole assembly of Israel gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them.
JOS.22.13	So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead—to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.22.14	With him they sent ten of the chief men, one from each of the tribes of Israel, each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans.
JOS.22.15	When they went to Gilead—to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh—they said to them: 
JOS.22.16	“The whole assembly of the 
JOS.22.17	Was not the sin of Peor enough for us? Up to this very day we have not cleansed ourselves from that sin, even though a plague fell on the community of the 
JOS.22.18	And are you now turning away from the 
JOS.22.18	“ ‘If you rebel against the 
JOS.22.19	If the land you possess is defiled, come over to the 
JOS.22.20	When Achan son of Zerah was unfaithful in regard to the devoted things,
JOS.22.21	Then Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh replied to the heads of the clans of Israel: 
JOS.22.22	“The Mighty One, God, the 
JOS.22.23	If we have built our own altar to turn away from the 
JOS.22.24	“No! We did it for fear that some day your descendants might say to ours, ‘What do you have to do with the 
JOS.22.25	The 
JOS.22.26	“That is why we said, ‘Let us get ready and build an altar—but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices.’ 
JOS.22.27	On the contrary, it is to be a witness between us and you and the generations that follow, that we will worship the 
JOS.22.28	“And we said, ‘If they ever say this to us, or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the 
JOS.22.29	“Far be it from us to rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community—the heads of the clans of the Israelites—heard what Reuben, Gad and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased. 
JOS.22.31	And Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, said to Reuben, Gad and Manasseh, “Today we know that the 
JOS.22.32	Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the leaders returned to Canaan from their meeting with the Reubenites and Gadites in Gilead and reported to the Israelites. 
JOS.22.33	They were glad to hear the report and praised God. And they talked no more about going to war against them to devastate the country where the Reubenites and the Gadites lived.
JOS.22.34	And the Reubenites and the Gadites gave the altar this name: A Witness Between Us—that the 
JOS.23.1	After a long time had passed and the 
JOS.23.2	summoned all Israel—their elders, leaders, judges and officials—and said to them: “I am very old. 
JOS.23.3	You yourselves have seen everything the 
JOS.23.4	Remember how I have allotted as an inheritance for your tribes all the land of the nations that remain—the nations I conquered—between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
JOS.23.5	The 
JOS.23.6	“Be very strong; be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, without turning aside to the right or to the left. 
JOS.23.7	Do not associate with these nations that remain among you; do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them. You must not serve them or bow down to them. 
JOS.23.8	But you are to hold fast to the 
JOS.23.9	“The 
JOS.23.10	One of you routs a thousand, because the 
JOS.23.11	So be very careful to love the 
JOS.23.12	“But if you turn away and ally yourselves with the survivors of these nations that remain among you and if you intermarry with them and associate with them, 
JOS.23.13	then you may be sure that the 
JOS.23.14	“Now I am about to go the way of all the earth. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the 
JOS.23.15	But just as all the good things the 
JOS.23.16	If you violate the covenant of the 
JOS.24.1	Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges and officials of Israel, and they presented themselves before God.
JOS.24.2	Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the 
JOS.24.3	But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the Euphrates and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac, 
JOS.24.4	and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau, but Jacob and his family went down to Egypt.
JOS.24.5	“ ‘Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and I brought you out. 
JOS.24.6	When I brought your people out of Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen
JOS.24.7	But they cried to the 
JOS.24.8	“ ‘I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands. I destroyed them from before you, and you took possession of their land. 
JOS.24.9	When Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, prepared to fight against Israel, he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a curse on you. 
JOS.24.10	But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you out of his hand.
JOS.24.11	“ ‘Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did also the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands. 
JOS.24.12	I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you—also the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow. 
JOS.24.13	So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’
JOS.24.14	“Now fear the 
JOS.24.15	But if serving the 
JOS.24.16	Then the people answered, “Far be it from us to forsake the 
JOS.24.17	It was the 
JOS.24.18	And the 
JOS.24.19	Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the 
JOS.24.20	If you forsake the 
JOS.24.21	But the people said to Joshua, “No! We will serve the 
JOS.24.22	Then Joshua said, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the 
JOS.24.22	“Yes, we are witnesses,” they replied.
JOS.24.23	“Now then,” said Joshua, “throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the 
JOS.24.24	And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve the 
JOS.24.25	On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he reaffirmed for them decrees and laws. 
JOS.24.26	And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the 
JOS.24.27	“See!” he said to all the people. “This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the 
JOS.24.28	Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to their own inheritance.
JOS.24.29	After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the 
JOS.24.30	And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Serah
JOS.24.31	Israel served the 
JOS.24.32	And Joseph’s bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver
JOS.24.33	And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
JDG.1.1	After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the 
JDG.1.2	The 
JDG.1.3	The men of Judah then said to the Simeonites their fellow Israelites, “Come up with us into the territory allotted to us, to fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours.” So the Simeonites went with them.
JDG.1.4	When Judah attacked, the 
JDG.1.5	It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites. 
JDG.1.6	Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
JDG.1.7	Then Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
JDG.1.8	The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.
JDG.1.9	After that, Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills. 
JDG.1.10	They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai. 
JDG.1.11	From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).
JDG.1.12	And Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.” 
JDG.1.13	Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage.
JDG.1.14	One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him
JDG.1.15	She replied, “Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
JDG.1.16	The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went up from the City of Palms
JDG.1.17	Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their fellow Israelites and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed
JDG.1.18	Judah also took
JDG.1.19	The 
JDG.1.20	As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove from it the three sons of Anak. 
JDG.1.21	The Benjamites, however, did not drive out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites.
JDG.1.22	Now the tribes of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the 
JDG.1.23	When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz), 
JDG.1.24	the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, “Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well.” 
JDG.1.25	So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family. 
JDG.1.26	He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day.
JDG.1.27	But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land. 
JDG.1.28	When Israel became strong, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely. 
JDG.1.29	Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, but the Canaanites continued to live there among them. 
JDG.1.30	Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, so these Canaanites lived among them, but Zebulun did subject them to forced labor. 
JDG.1.31	Nor did Asher drive out those living in Akko or Sidon or Ahlab or Akzib or Helbah or Aphek or Rehob. 
JDG.1.32	The Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land because they did not drive them out. 
JDG.1.33	Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced laborers for them. 
JDG.1.34	The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain. 
JDG.1.35	And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, but when the power of the tribes of Joseph increased, they too were pressed into forced labor.

JDG.2.3	And I have also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you; they will become traps for you, and their gods will become snares to you.’ ”
JDG.2.4	When the angel of the

JDG.2.6	After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to their own inheritance. 
JDG.2.7	The people served the 
JDG.2.8	Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the 
JDG.2.9	And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres
JDG.2.10	After that whole generation had been gathered to their ancestors, another generation grew up who knew neither the 
JDG.2.11	Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the 
JDG.2.12	They forsook the 
JDG.2.13	because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths. 
JDG.2.14	In his anger against Israel the 
JDG.2.15	Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the 
JDG.2.16	Then the 
JDG.2.17	Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. They quickly turned from the ways of their ancestors, who had been obedient to the 
JDG.2.18	Whenever the 
JDG.2.19	But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their ancestors, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
JDG.2.20	Therefore the 
JDG.2.21	I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died. 
JDG.2.22	I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the 
JDG.2.23	The 
JDG.3.1	These are the nations the 
JDG.3.2	(he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience): 
JDG.3.3	the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath. 
JDG.3.4	They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the 
JDG.3.5	The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
JDG.3.6	They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
JDG.3.7	The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the 
JDG.3.8	The anger of the 
JDG.3.9	But when they cried out to the 
JDG.3.10	The Spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the 
JDG.3.13	Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms.
JDG.3.14	The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	Again the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.3.16	Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a cubit
JDG.3.17	He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man. 
JDG.3.18	After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way those who had carried it. 
JDG.3.19	But on reaching the stone images near Gilgal he himself went back to Eglon and said, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.”
JDG.3.19	The king said to his attendants, “Leave us!” And they all left.
JDG.3.20	Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his palace
JDG.3.21	Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king’s belly. 
JDG.3.22	Even the handle sank in after the blade, and his bowels discharged. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it. 
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went out to the porch
JDG.3.24	After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, “He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the palace.” 
JDG.3.25	They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their lord fallen to the floor, dead.
JDG.3.26	While they waited, Ehud got away. He passed by the stone images and escaped to Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them.
JDG.3.28	“Follow me,” he ordered, “for the 
JDG.3.29	At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not one escaped. 
JDG.3.30	That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.
JDG.3.31	After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel.
JDG.4.1	Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the 
JDG.4.2	So the 
JDG.4.3	Because he had nine hundred chariots fitted with iron and had cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years, they cried to the 
JDG.4.4	Now Deborah, a prophet, the wife of Lappidoth, was leading
JDG.4.5	She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went up to her to have their disputes decided. 
JDG.4.6	She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “The 
JDG.4.7	I will lead Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River and give him into your hands.’ ”
JDG.4.8	Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I will go; but if you don’t go with me, I won’t go.”
JDG.4.9	“Certainly I will go with you,” said Deborah. “But because of the course you are taking, the honor will not be yours, for the 
JDG.4.10	There Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali, and ten thousand men went up under his command. Deborah also went up with him.
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law,
JDG.4.12	When they told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor, 
JDG.4.13	Sisera summoned from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River all his men and his nine hundred chariots fitted with iron.
JDG.4.14	Then Deborah said to Barak, “Go! This is the day the 
JDG.4.15	At Barak’s advance, the 
JDG.4.16	Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and all Sisera’s troops fell by the sword; not a man was left. 
JDG.4.17	Sisera, meanwhile, fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was an alliance between Jabin king of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite.
JDG.4.18	Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come, my lord, come right in. Don’t be afraid.” So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
JDG.4.19	“I’m thirsty,” he said. “Please give me some water.” She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him up.
JDG.4.20	“Stand in the doorway of the tent,” he told her. “If someone comes by and asks you, ‘Is anyone in there?’ say ‘No.’ ”
JDG.4.21	But Jael, Heber’s wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.
JDG.4.22	Just then Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. “Come,” she said, “I will show you the man you’re looking for.” So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his temple—dead.
JDG.4.23	On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites. 
JDG.4.24	And the hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder against Jabin king of Canaan until they destroyed him.
JDG.5.1	On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:
JDG.5.2	“When the princes in Israel take the lead,
JDG.5.2	when the people willingly offer themselves—
JDG.5.2	praise the 
JDG.5.3	“Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers!
JDG.5.3	I, even I, will sing to
JDG.5.3	I will praise the 
JDG.5.4	“When you, 
JDG.5.4	when you marched from the land of Edom,
JDG.5.4	the earth shook, the heavens poured,
JDG.5.4	the clouds poured down water.
JDG.5.5	The mountains quaked before the 
JDG.5.5	before the 
JDG.5.6	“In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,
JDG.5.6	in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned;
JDG.5.6	travelers took to winding paths.
JDG.5.7	Villagers in Israel would not fight;
JDG.5.7	they held back until I, Deborah, arose,
JDG.5.7	until I arose, a mother in Israel.
JDG.5.8	God chose new leaders
JDG.5.8	when war came to the city gates,
JDG.5.8	but not a shield or spear was seen
JDG.5.8	among forty thousand in Israel.
JDG.5.9	My heart is with Israel’s princes,
JDG.5.9	with the willing volunteers among the people.
JDG.5.9	Praise the 
JDG.5.10	“You who ride on white donkeys,
JDG.5.10	sitting on your saddle blankets,
JDG.5.10	and you who walk along the road,
JDG.5.10	consider 
JDG.5.11	the voice of the singers
JDG.5.11	They recite the victories of the 
JDG.5.11	the victories of his villagers in Israel.
JDG.5.11	“Then the people of the 
JDG.5.11	went down to the city gates.
JDG.5.12	‘Wake up, wake up, Deborah!
JDG.5.12	Wake up, wake up, break out in song!
JDG.5.12	Arise, Barak!
JDG.5.12	Take captive your captives, son of Abinoam.’
JDG.5.13	“The remnant of the nobles came down;
JDG.5.13	the people of the 
JDG.5.14	Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek;
JDG.5.14	Benjamin was with the people who followed you.
JDG.5.14	From Makir captains came down,
JDG.5.14	from Zebulun those who bear a commander’s
JDG.5.15	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah;
JDG.5.15	yes, Issachar was with Barak,
JDG.5.15	sent under his command into the valley.
JDG.5.15	In the districts of Reuben
JDG.5.15	there was much searching of heart.
JDG.5.16	Why did you stay among the sheep pens
JDG.5.16	to hear the whistling for the flocks?
JDG.5.16	In the districts of Reuben
JDG.5.16	there was much searching of heart.
JDG.5.17	Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan.
JDG.5.17	And Dan, why did he linger by the ships?
JDG.5.17	Asher remained on the coast
JDG.5.17	and stayed in his coves.
JDG.5.18	The people of Zebulun risked their very lives;
JDG.5.18	so did Naphtali on the terraced fields.
JDG.5.19	“Kings came, they fought,
JDG.5.19	the kings of Canaan fought.
JDG.5.19	At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo,
JDG.5.19	they took no plunder of silver.
JDG.5.20	From the heavens the stars fought,
JDG.5.20	from their courses they fought against Sisera.
JDG.5.21	The river Kishon swept them away,
JDG.5.21	the age-old river, the river Kishon.
JDG.5.21	March on, my soul; be strong!
JDG.5.22	Then thundered the horses’ hooves—
JDG.5.22	galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds.
JDG.5.23	‘Curse Meroz,’ said the angel of the 
JDG.5.23	‘Curse its people bitterly,
JDG.5.23	because they did not come to help the 
JDG.5.23	to help the 
JDG.5.24	“Most blessed of women be Jael,
JDG.5.24	the wife of Heber the Kenite,
JDG.5.24	most blessed of tent-dwelling women.
JDG.5.25	He asked for water, and she gave him milk;
JDG.5.25	in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk.
JDG.5.26	Her hand reached for the tent peg,
JDG.5.26	her right hand for the workman’s hammer.
JDG.5.26	She struck Sisera, she crushed his head,
JDG.5.26	she shattered and pierced his temple.
JDG.5.27	At her feet he sank,
JDG.5.27	he fell; there he lay.
JDG.5.27	At her feet he sank, he fell;
JDG.5.27	where he sank, there he fell—dead.
JDG.5.28	“Through the window peered Sisera’s mother;
JDG.5.28	behind the lattice she cried out,
JDG.5.28	‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?
JDG.5.28	Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?’
JDG.5.29	The wisest of her ladies answer her;
JDG.5.29	indeed, she keeps saying to herself,
JDG.5.30	‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoils:
JDG.5.30	a woman or two for each man,
JDG.5.30	colorful garments as plunder for Sisera,
JDG.5.30	colorful garments embroidered,
JDG.5.30	highly embroidered garments for my neck—
JDG.5.30	all this as plunder?’
JDG.5.31	“So may all your enemies perish, 
JDG.5.31	But may all who love you be like the sun
JDG.5.31	when it rises in its strength.”
JDG.5.31	Then the land had peace forty years.
JDG.6.1	The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the 
JDG.6.2	Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds. 
JDG.6.3	Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country. 
JDG.6.4	They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys. 
JDG.6.5	They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count them or their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it. 
JDG.6.6	Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the 
JDG.6.7	When the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.6.8	he sent them a prophet, who said, “This is what the 
JDG.6.9	I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians. And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land. 
JDG.6.10	I said to you, ‘I am the 
JDG.6.11	The angel of the 
JDG.6.12	When the angel of the 
JDG.6.13	“Pardon me, my lord,” Gideon replied, “but if the 
JDG.6.14	The 
JDG.6.15	“Pardon me, my lord,” Gideon replied, “but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.”
JDG.6.16	The 
JDG.6.17	Gideon replied, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me. 
JDG.6.18	Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.”
JDG.6.18	And the 
JDG.6.19	Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah
JDG.6.20	The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And Gideon did so. 
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of the 
JDG.6.22	When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the 
JDG.6.23	But the 
JDG.6.24	So Gideon built an altar to the 
JDG.6.25	That same night the 
JDG.6.26	Then build a proper kind of
JDG.6.27	So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the 
JDG.6.28	In the morning when the people of the town got up, there was Baal’s altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar!
JDG.6.29	They asked each other, “Who did this?”
JDG.6.29	When they carefully investigated, they were told, “Gideon son of Joash did it.”
JDG.6.30	The people of the town demanded of Joash, “Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.”
JDG.6.31	But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, “Are you going to plead Baal’s cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.” 
JDG.6.32	So because Gideon broke down Baal’s altar, they gave him the name Jerub-Baal
JDG.6.33	Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. 
JDG.6.34	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.
JDG.6.36	Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised— 
JDG.6.37	look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.” 
JDG.6.38	And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water.
JDG.6.39	Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew.” 
JDG.6.40	That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.
JDG.7.1	Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh. 
JDG.7.2	The 
JDG.7.3	Now announce to the army, ‘Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’ ” So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained.
JDG.7.4	But the 
JDG.7.5	So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the 
JDG.7.6	Three hundred of them drank from cupped hands, lapping like dogs. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.
JDG.7.7	The 
JDG.7.8	So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites home but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others.
JDG.7.8	Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley. 
JDG.7.9	During that night the 
JDG.7.10	If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah 
JDG.7.11	and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp.” So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp. 
JDG.7.12	The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.
JDG.7.13	Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. “I had a dream,” he was saying. “A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.”
JDG.7.14	His friend responded, “This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.”
JDG.7.15	When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down and worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, “Get up! The 
JDG.7.16	Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside.
JDG.7.17	“Watch me,” he told them. “Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do. 
JDG.7.18	When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, ‘For the 
JDG.7.19	Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands. 
JDG.7.20	The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, “A sword for the 
JDG.7.21	While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.
JDG.7.22	When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the 
JDG.7.23	Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites. 
JDG.7.24	Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah.”
JDG.7.24	So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they seized the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah. 
JDG.7.25	They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.
JDG.8.1	Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, “Why have you treated us like this? Why didn’t you call us when you went to fight Midian?” And they challenged him vigorously.
JDG.8.2	But he answered them, “What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren’t the gleanings of Ephraim’s grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer? 
JDG.8.3	God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?” At this, their resentment against him subsided.
JDG.8.4	Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it. 
JDG.8.5	He said to the men of Sukkoth, “Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
JDG.8.6	But the officials of Sukkoth said, “Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?”
JDG.8.7	Then Gideon replied, “Just for that, when the 
JDG.8.8	From there he went up to Peniel
JDG.8.9	So he said to the men of Peniel, “When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower.”
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen. 
JDG.8.11	Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the unsuspecting army. 
JDG.8.12	Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army.
JDG.8.13	Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres. 
JDG.8.14	He caught a young man of Sukkoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Sukkoth, the elders of the town. 
JDG.8.15	Then Gideon came and said to the men of Sukkoth, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, ‘Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?’ ” 
JDG.8.16	He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Sukkoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers. 
JDG.8.17	He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town.
JDG.8.18	Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?”
JDG.8.18	“Men like you,” they answered, “each one with the bearing of a prince.”
JDG.8.19	Gideon replied, “Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the 
JDG.8.20	Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, “Kill them!” But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid.
JDG.8.21	Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Come, do it yourself. ‘As is the man, so is his strength.’ ” So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels’ necks.
JDG.8.22	The Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you, your son and your grandson—because you have saved us from the hand of Midian.”
JDG.8.23	But Gideon told them, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The 
JDG.8.24	And he said, “I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder.” (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.)
JDG.8.25	They answered, “We’ll be glad to give them.” So they spread out a garment, and each of them threw a ring from his plunder onto it. 
JDG.8.26	The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels,
JDG.8.27	Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.
JDG.8.28	Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon’s lifetime, the land had peace forty years.
JDG.8.29	Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live. 
JDG.8.30	He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelek. 
JDG.8.32	Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
JDG.8.33	No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god 
JDG.8.34	and did not remember the 
JDG.8.35	They also failed to show any loyalty to the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) in spite of all the good things he had done for them.
JDG.9.1	Abimelek son of Jerub-Baal went to his mother’s brothers in Shechem and said to them and to all his mother’s clan, 
JDG.9.2	“Ask all the citizens of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you: to have all seventy of Jerub-Baal’s sons rule over you, or just one man?’ Remember, I am your flesh and blood.”
JDG.9.3	When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem, they were inclined to follow Abimelek, for they said, “He is related to us.” 
JDG.9.4	They gave him seventy shekels
JDG.9.5	He went to his father’s home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerub-Baal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerub-Baal, escaped by hiding. 
JDG.9.6	Then all the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown Abimelek king.
JDG.9.7	When Jotham was told about this, he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, “Listen to me, citizens of Shechem, so that God may listen to you. 
JDG.9.8	One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Be our king.’
JDG.9.9	“But the olive tree answered, ‘Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honored, to hold sway over the trees?’
JDG.9.10	“Next, the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and be our king.’
JDG.9.11	“But the fig tree replied, ‘Should I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?’
JDG.9.12	“Then the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and be our king.’
JDG.9.13	“But the vine answered, ‘Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?’
JDG.9.14	“Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘Come and be our king.’
JDG.9.15	“The thornbush said to the trees, ‘If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!’
JDG.9.16	“Have you acted honorably and in good faith by making Abimelek king? Have you been fair to Jerub-Baal and his family? Have you treated him as he deserves? 
JDG.9.17	Remember that my father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from the hand of Midian. 
JDG.9.18	But today you have revolted against my father’s family. You have murdered his seventy sons on a single stone and have made Abimelek, the son of his female slave, king over the citizens of Shechem because he is related to you. 
JDG.9.19	So have you acted honorably and in good faith toward Jerub-Baal and his family today? If you have, may Abimelek be your joy, and may you be his, too! 
JDG.9.20	But if you have not, let fire come out from Abimelek and consume you, the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and let fire come out from you, the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and consume Abimelek!”
JDG.9.21	Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer, and he lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelek.
JDG.9.22	After Abimelek had governed Israel three years, 
JDG.9.23	God stirred up animosity between Abimelek and the citizens of Shechem so that they acted treacherously against Abimelek. 
JDG.9.24	God did this in order that the crime against Jerub-Baal’s seventy sons, the shedding of their blood, might be avenged on their brother Abimelek and on the citizens of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers. 
JDG.9.25	In opposition to him these citizens of Shechem set men on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by, and this was reported to Abimelek.
JDG.9.26	Now Gaal son of Ebed moved with his clan into Shechem, and its citizens put their confidence in him. 
JDG.9.27	After they had gone out into the fields and gathered the grapes and trodden them, they held a festival in the temple of their god. While they were eating and drinking, they cursed Abimelek. 
JDG.9.28	Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelek, and why should we Shechemites be subject to him? Isn’t he Jerub-Baal’s son, and isn’t Zebul his deputy? Serve the family of Hamor, Shechem’s father! Why should we serve Abimelek? 
JDG.9.29	If only this people were under my command! Then I would get rid of him. I would say to Abimelek, ‘Call out your whole army!’ ”
JDG.9.30	When Zebul the governor of the city heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he was very angry. 
JDG.9.31	Under cover he sent messengers to Abimelek, saying, “Gaal son of Ebed and his clan have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you. 
JDG.9.32	Now then, during the night you and your men should come and lie in wait in the fields. 
JDG.9.33	In the morning at sunrise, advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, seize the opportunity to attack them.”
JDG.9.34	So Abimelek and all his troops set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four companies. 
JDG.9.35	Now Gaal son of Ebed had gone out and was standing at the entrance of the city gate just as Abimelek and his troops came out from their hiding place.
JDG.9.36	When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!”
JDG.9.36	Zebul replied, “You mistake the shadows of the mountains for men.”
JDG.9.37	But Gaal spoke up again: “Look, people are coming down from the central hill,
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your big talk now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelek that we should be subject to him?’ Aren’t these the men you ridiculed? Go out and fight them!”
JDG.9.39	So Gaal led out
JDG.9.40	Abimelek chased him all the way to the entrance of the gate, and many were killed as they fled. 
JDG.9.41	Then Abimelek stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his clan out of Shechem.
JDG.9.42	The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields, and this was reported to Abimelek. 
JDG.9.43	So he took his men, divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose to attack them. 
JDG.9.44	Abimelek and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance of the city gate. Then two companies attacked those in the fields and struck them down. 
JDG.9.45	All that day Abimelek pressed his attack against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it.
JDG.9.46	On hearing this, the citizens in the tower of Shechem went into the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith. 
JDG.9.47	When Abimelek heard that they had assembled there, 
JDG.9.48	he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon. He took an ax and cut off some branches, which he lifted to his shoulders. He ordered the men with him, “Quick! Do what you have seen me do!” 
JDG.9.49	So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelek. They piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire with the people still inside. So all the people in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women, also died.
JDG.9.50	Next Abimelek went to Thebez and besieged it and captured it. 
JDG.9.51	Inside the city, however, was a strong tower, to which all the men and women—all the people of the city—had fled. They had locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof. 
JDG.9.52	Abimelek went to the tower and attacked it. But as he approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire, 
JDG.9.53	a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull.
JDG.9.54	Hurriedly he called to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that they can’t say, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” So his servant ran him through, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	When the Israelites saw that Abimelek was dead, they went home.
JDG.9.56	Thus God repaid the wickedness that Abimelek had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers. 
JDG.9.57	God also made the people of Shechem pay for all their wickedness. The curse of Jotham son of Jerub-Baal came on them.
JDG.10.1	After the time of Abimelek, a man of Issachar named Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	He led
JDG.10.3	He was followed by Jair of Gilead, who led Israel twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	He had thirty sons, who rode thirty donkeys. They controlled thirty towns in Gilead, which to this day are called Havvoth Jair.
JDG.10.5	When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon.
JDG.10.6	Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the 
JDG.10.7	he became angry with them. He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites, 
JDG.10.8	who that year shattered and crushed them. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites on the east side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites. 
JDG.10.9	The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and Ephraim; Israel was in great distress. 
JDG.10.10	Then the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.10.11	The 
JDG.10.12	the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites
JDG.10.13	But you have forsaken me and served other gods, so I will no longer save you. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you when you are in trouble!”
JDG.10.15	But the Israelites said to the 
JDG.10.16	Then they got rid of the foreign gods among them and served the 
JDG.10.17	When the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead, the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah. 
JDG.10.18	The leaders of the people of Gilead said to each other, “Whoever will take the lead in attacking the Ammonites will be head over all who live in Gilead.”
JDG.11.1	Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. His father was Gilead; his mother was a prostitute. 
JDG.11.2	Gilead’s wife also bore him sons, and when they were grown up, they drove Jephthah away. “You are not going to get any inheritance in our family,” they said, “because you are the son of another woman.” 
JDG.11.3	So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where a gang of scoundrels gathered around him and followed him.
JDG.11.4	Some time later, when the Ammonites were fighting against Israel, 
JDG.11.5	the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. 
JDG.11.6	“Come,” they said, “be our commander, so we can fight the Ammonites.”
JDG.11.7	Jephthah said to them, “Didn’t you hate me and drive me from my father’s house? Why do you come to me now, when you’re in trouble?”
JDG.11.8	The elders of Gilead said to him, “Nevertheless, we are turning to you now; come with us to fight the Ammonites, and you will be head over all of us who live in Gilead.”
JDG.11.9	Jephthah answered, “Suppose you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the 
JDG.11.10	The elders of Gilead replied, “The 
JDG.11.11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. And he repeated all his words before the 
JDG.11.12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question: “What do you have against me that you have attacked my country?”
JDG.11.13	The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah’s messengers, “When Israel came up out of Egypt, they took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, all the way to the Jordan. Now give it back peaceably.”
JDG.11.14	Jephthah sent back messengers to the Ammonite king, 
JDG.11.15	saying:
JDG.11.15	“This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites. 
JDG.11.16	But when they came up out of Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea
JDG.11.17	Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Give us permission to go through your country,’ but the king of Edom would not listen. They sent also to the king of Moab, and he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh.
JDG.11.18	“Next they traveled through the wilderness, skirted the lands of Edom and Moab, passed along the eastern side of the country of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was its border.
JDG.11.19	“Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, ‘Let us pass through your country to our own place.’ 
JDG.11.20	Sihon, however, did not trust Israel
JDG.11.21	“Then the 
JDG.11.22	capturing all of it from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to the Jordan.
JDG.11.23	“Now since the 
JDG.11.24	Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the 
JDG.11.25	Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or fight with them? 
JDG.11.26	For three hundred years Israel occupied Heshbon, Aroer, the surrounding settlements and all the towns along the Arnon. Why didn’t you retake them during that time? 
JDG.11.27	I have not wronged you, but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me. Let the 
JDG.11.28	The king of Ammon, however, paid no attention to the message Jephthah sent him.
JDG.11.29	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.11.30	And Jephthah made a vow to the 
JDG.11.31	whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the 
JDG.11.32	Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the 
JDG.11.33	He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon.
JDG.11.34	When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter. 
JDG.11.35	When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, “Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated. I have made a vow to the 
JDG.11.36	“My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the 
JDG.11.37	But grant me this one request,” she said. “Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry.”
JDG.11.38	“You may go,” he said. And he let her go for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry. 
JDG.11.39	After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin.
JDG.11.39	From this comes the Israelite tradition 
JDG.11.40	that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
JDG.12.1	The Ephraimite forces were called out, and they crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We’re going to burn down your house over your head.”
JDG.12.2	Jephthah answered, “I and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites, and although I called, you didn’t save me out of their hands. 
JDG.12.3	When I saw that you wouldn’t help, I took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the 
JDG.12.4	Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, “You Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh.” 
JDG.12.5	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a survivor of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead asked him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he replied, “No,” 
JDG.12.6	they said, “All right, say ‘Shibboleth.’ ” If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce the word correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time.
JDG.12.7	Jephthah led
JDG.12.8	After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel. 
JDG.12.9	He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters away in marriage to those outside his clan, and for his sons he brought in thirty young women as wives from outside his clan. Ibzan led Israel seven years. 
JDG.12.10	Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	After him, Elon the Zebulunite led Israel ten years. 
JDG.12.12	Then Elon died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	After him, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, led Israel. 
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. He led Israel eight years. 
JDG.12.15	Then Abdon son of Hillel died and was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the 
JDG.13.2	A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, had a wife who was childless, unable to give birth. 
JDG.13.3	The angel of the 
JDG.13.4	Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean. 
JDG.13.5	You will become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor because the boy is to be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from the womb. He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines.”
JDG.13.6	Then the woman went to her husband and told him, “A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome. I didn’t ask him where he came from, and he didn’t tell me his name. 
JDG.13.7	But he said to me, ‘You will become pregnant and have a son. Now then, drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from the womb until the day of his death.’ ”
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah prayed to the 
JDG.13.9	God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her. 
JDG.13.10	The woman hurried to tell her husband, “He’s here! The man who appeared to me the other day!”
JDG.13.11	Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, “Are you the man who talked to my wife?”
JDG.13.11	“I am,” he said.
JDG.13.12	So Manoah asked him, “When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule that governs the boy’s life and work?”
JDG.13.13	The angel of the 
JDG.13.14	She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.”
JDG.13.15	Manoah said to the angel of the 
JDG.13.16	The angel of the 
JDG.13.17	Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the 
JDG.13.18	He replied, “Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding.
JDG.13.19	Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering, and sacrificed it on a rock to the 
JDG.13.20	As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the 
JDG.13.21	When the angel of the 
JDG.13.22	“We are doomed to die!” he said to his wife. “We have seen God!”
JDG.13.23	But his wife answered, “If the 
JDG.13.24	The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson. He grew and the 
JDG.13.25	and the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.1	Samson went down to Timnah and saw there a young Philistine woman. 
JDG.14.2	When he returned, he said to his father and mother, “I have seen a Philistine woman in Timnah; now get her for me as my wife.”
JDG.14.3	His father and mother replied, “Isn’t there an acceptable woman among your relatives or among all our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?”
JDG.14.3	But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me. She’s the right one for me.” 
JDG.14.4	(His parents did not know that this was from the 
JDG.14.5	Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him. 
JDG.14.6	The Spirit of the 
JDG.14.7	Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her.
JDG.14.8	Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion’s carcass, and in it he saw a swarm of bees and some honey. 
JDG.14.9	He scooped out the honey with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass.
JDG.14.10	Now his father went down to see the woman. And there Samson held a feast, as was customary for young men. 
JDG.14.11	When the people saw him, they chose thirty men to be his companions.
JDG.14.12	“Let me tell you a riddle,” Samson said to them. “If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes. 
JDG.14.13	If you can’t tell me the answer, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.”
JDG.14.13	“Tell us your riddle,” they said. “Let’s hear it.”
JDG.14.14	He replied,
JDG.14.14	“Out of the eater, something to eat;
JDG.14.14	out of the strong, something sweet.”
JDG.14.14	For three days they could not give the answer.
JDG.14.15	On the fourth
JDG.14.16	Then Samson’s wife threw herself on him, sobbing, “You hate me! You don’t really love me. You’ve given my people a riddle, but you haven’t told me the answer.”
JDG.14.16	“I haven’t even explained it to my father or mother,” he replied, “so why should I explain it to you?” 
JDG.14.17	She cried the whole seven days of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her, because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people.
JDG.14.18	Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him,
JDG.14.18	“What is sweeter than honey?
JDG.14.18	What is stronger than a lion?”
JDG.14.18	Samson said to them,
JDG.14.18	“If you had not plowed with my heifer,
JDG.14.18	you would not have solved my riddle.”
JDG.14.19	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.20	And Samson’s wife was given to one of his companions who had attended him at the feast.
JDG.15.1	Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. He said, “I’m going to my wife’s room.” But her father would not let him go in.
JDG.15.2	“I was so sure you hated her,” he said, “that I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more attractive? Take her instead.”
JDG.15.3	Samson said to them, “This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines; I will really harm them.” 
JDG.15.4	So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails, 
JDG.15.5	lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks and standing grain, together with the vineyards and olive groves.
JDG.15.6	When the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” they were told, “Samson, the Timnite’s son-in-law, because his wife was given to his companion.”
JDG.15.6	So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death. 
JDG.15.7	Samson said to them, “Since you’ve acted like this, I swear that I won’t stop until I get my revenge on you.” 
JDG.15.8	He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.
JDG.15.9	The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	The people of Judah asked, “Why have you come to fight us?”
JDG.15.10	“We have come to take Samson prisoner,” they answered, “to do to him as he did to us.”
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Don’t you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us? What have you done to us?”
JDG.15.11	He answered, “I merely did to them what they did to me.”
JDG.15.12	They said to him, “We’ve come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.”
JDG.15.12	Samson said, “Swear to me that you won’t kill me yourselves.”
JDG.15.13	“Agreed,” they answered. “We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock. 
JDG.15.14	As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the 
JDG.15.15	Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.
JDG.15.16	Then Samson said,
JDG.15.16	“With a donkey’s jawbone
JDG.15.16	I have made donkeys of them.
JDG.15.16	With a donkey’s jawbone
JDG.15.16	I have killed a thousand men.”
JDG.15.17	When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi.
JDG.15.18	Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the 
JDG.15.19	Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived. So the spring was called En Hakkore,
JDG.15.20	Samson led
JDG.16.1	One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her. 
JDG.16.2	The people of Gaza were told, “Samson is here!” So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying, “At dawn we’ll kill him.”
JDG.16.3	But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.
JDG.16.4	Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah. 
JDG.16.5	The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, “See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels
JDG.16.6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued.”
JDG.16.7	Samson answered her, “If anyone ties me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I’ll become as weak as any other man.”
JDG.16.8	Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him with them. 
JDG.16.9	With men hidden in the room, she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” But he snapped the bowstrings as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.
JDG.16.10	Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied.”
JDG.16.11	He said, “If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I’ll become as weak as any other man.”
JDG.16.12	So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.
JDG.16.13	Delilah then said to Samson, “All this time you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied.”
JDG.16.13	He replied, “If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I’ll become as weak as any other man.” So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric 
JDG.16.14	and
JDG.16.14	Again she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric.
JDG.16.15	Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when you won’t confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven’t told me the secret of your great strength.” 
JDG.16.16	With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was sick to death of it.
JDG.16.17	So he told her everything. “No razor has ever been used on my head,” he said, “because I have been a Nazirite dedicated to God from my mother’s womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man.”
JDG.16.18	When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, “Come back once more; he has told me everything.” So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands. 
JDG.16.19	After putting him to sleep on her lap, she called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him.
JDG.16.20	Then she called, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!”
JDG.16.20	He awoke from his sleep and thought, “I’ll go out as before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the 
JDG.16.21	Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison. 
JDG.16.22	But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
JDG.16.23	Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, “Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.”
JDG.16.24	When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying,
JDG.16.24	“Our god has delivered our enemy
JDG.16.24	into our hands,
JDG.16.24	the one who laid waste our land
JDG.16.24	and multiplied our slain.”
JDG.16.25	While they were in high spirits, they shouted, “Bring out Samson to entertain us.” So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them.
JDG.16.25	When they stood him among the pillars, 
JDG.16.26	Samson said to the servant who held his hand, “Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them.” 
JDG.16.27	Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform. 
JDG.16.28	Then Samson prayed to the 
JDG.16.29	Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other, 
JDG.16.30	Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived.
JDG.16.31	Then his brothers and his father’s whole family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led
JDG.17.1	Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim 
JDG.17.2	said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels
JDG.17.2	Then his mother said, “The 
JDG.17.3	When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, “I solemnly consecrate my silver to the 
JDG.17.4	So after he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred shekels
JDG.17.5	Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household gods and installed one of his sons as his priest. 
JDG.17.6	In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit.
JDG.17.7	A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah, 
JDG.17.8	left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way
JDG.17.9	Micah asked him, “Where are you from?”
JDG.17.9	“I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he said, “and I’m looking for a place to stay.”
JDG.17.10	Then Micah said to him, “Live with me and be my father and priest, and I’ll give you ten shekels
JDG.17.11	So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man became like one of his sons to him. 
JDG.17.12	Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house. 
JDG.17.13	And Micah said, “Now I know that the 
JDG.18.1	In those days Israel had no king.
JDG.18.1	And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. 
JDG.18.2	So the Danites sent five of their leading men from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all the Danites. They told them, “Go, explore the land.”
JDG.18.2	So they entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night. 
JDG.18.3	When they were near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?”
JDG.18.4	He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, “He has hired me and I am his priest.”
JDG.18.5	Then they said to him, “Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful.”
JDG.18.6	The priest answered them, “Go in peace. Your journey has the 
JDG.18.7	So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety, like the Sidonians, at peace and secure. And since their land lacked nothing, they were prosperous.
JDG.18.8	When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their fellow Danites asked them, “How did you find things?”
JDG.18.9	They answered, “Come on, let’s attack them! We have seen the land, and it is very good. Aren’t you going to do something? Don’t hesitate to go there and take it over. 
JDG.18.10	When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands, a land that lacks nothing whatever.”
JDG.18.11	Then six hundred men of the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol. 
JDG.18.12	On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan
JDG.18.13	From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house.
JDG.18.14	Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their fellow Danites, “Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, some household gods and an image overlaid with silver? Now you know what to do.” 
JDG.18.15	So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah’s place and greeted him. 
JDG.18.16	The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.18.17	The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the idol, the ephod and the household gods while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance of the gate.
JDG.18.18	When the five men went into Micah’s house and took the idol, the ephod and the household gods, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
JDG.18.19	They answered him, “Be quiet! Don’t say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn’t it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man’s household?” 
JDG.18.20	The priest was very pleased. He took the ephod, the household gods and the idol and went along with the people. 
JDG.18.21	Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left.
JDG.18.22	When they had gone some distance from Micah’s house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites. 
JDG.18.23	As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, “What’s the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?”
JDG.18.24	He replied, “You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, ‘What’s the matter with you?’ ”
JDG.18.25	The Danites answered, “Don’t argue with us, or some of the men may get angry and attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.” 
JDG.18.26	So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home.
JDG.18.27	Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a people at peace and secure. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city. 
JDG.18.28	There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob.
JDG.18.28	The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there. 
JDG.18.29	They named it Dan after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel—though the city used to be called Laish. 
JDG.18.30	There the Danites set up for themselves the idol, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses,
JDG.18.31	They continued to use the idol Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	In those days Israel had no king.
JDG.19.1	Now a Levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. 
JDG.19.2	But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her parents’ home in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months, 
JDG.19.3	her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her parents’ home, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him. 
JDG.19.4	His father-in-law, the woman’s father, prevailed on him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there.
JDG.19.5	On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go.” 
JDG.19.6	So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the woman’s father said, “Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself.” 
JDG.19.7	And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night. 
JDG.19.8	On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the woman’s father said, “Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!” So the two of them ate together.
JDG.19.9	Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the woman’s father, said, “Now look, it’s almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home.” 
JDG.19.10	But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.
JDG.19.11	When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, “Come, let’s stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.”
JDG.19.12	His master replied, “No. We won’t go into any city whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.” 
JDG.19.13	He added, “Come, let’s try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places.” 
JDG.19.14	So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them in for the night.
JDG.19.16	That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the inhabitants of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields. 
JDG.19.17	When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”
JDG.19.18	He answered, “We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the 
JDG.19.19	We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants—me, the woman and the young man with us. We don’t need anything.”
JDG.19.20	“You are welcome at my house,” the old man said. “Let me supply whatever you need. Only don’t spend the night in the square.” 
JDG.19.21	So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink.
JDG.19.22	While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.”
JDG.19.23	The owner of the house went outside and said to them, “No, my friends, don’t be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don’t do this outrageous thing. 
JDG.19.24	Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But as for this man, don’t do such an outrageous thing.”
JDG.19.25	But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. 
JDG.19.26	At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.
JDG.19.27	When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. 
JDG.19.28	He said to her, “Get up; let’s go.” But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.
JDG.19.29	When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	Everyone who saw it was saying to one another, “Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Just imagine! We must do something! So speak up!”
JDG.20.1	Then all Israel from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came together as one and assembled before the 
JDG.20.2	The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of God’s people, four hundred thousand men armed with swords. 
JDG.20.3	(The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the Israelites said, “Tell us how this awful thing happened.”
JDG.20.4	So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, “I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night. 
JDG.20.5	During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died. 
JDG.20.6	I took my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israel’s inheritance, because they committed this lewd and outrageous act in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	Now, all you Israelites, speak up and tell me what you have decided to do.”
JDG.20.8	All the men rose up together as one, saying, “None of us will go home. No, not one of us will return to his house. 
JDG.20.9	But now this is what we’ll do to Gibeah: We’ll go up against it in the order decided by casting lots. 
JDG.20.10	We’ll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to get provisions for the army. Then, when the army arrives at Gibeah
JDG.20.11	So all the Israelites got together and united as one against the city.
JDG.20.12	The tribes of Israel sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What about this awful crime that was committed among you? 
JDG.20.13	Now turn those wicked men of Gibeah over to us so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel.”
JDG.20.13	But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites. 
JDG.20.14	From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites. 
JDG.20.15	At once the Benjamites mobilized twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns, in addition to seven hundred able young men from those living in Gibeah. 
JDG.20.16	Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred select troops who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
JDG.20.17	Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all of them fit for battle.
JDG.20.18	The Israelites went up to Bethel
JDG.20.18	The 
JDG.20.19	The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	The Israelites went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day. 
JDG.20.22	But the Israelites encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day. 
JDG.20.23	The Israelites went up and wept before the 
JDG.20.23	The 
JDG.20.24	Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day. 
JDG.20.25	This time, when the Benjamites came out from Gibeah to oppose them, they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them armed with swords.
JDG.20.26	Then all the Israelites, the whole army, went up to Bethel, and there they sat weeping before the 
JDG.20.27	And the Israelites inquired of the 
JDG.20.28	with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.) They asked, “Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our fellow Israelites, or not?”
JDG.20.28	The 
JDG.20.29	Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah. 
JDG.20.30	They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before. 
JDG.20.31	The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads—the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah. 
JDG.20.32	While the Benjamites were saying, “We are defeating them as before,” the Israelites were saying, “Let’s retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads.”
JDG.20.33	All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west
JDG.20.34	Then ten thousand of Israel’s able young men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was. 
JDG.20.35	The 
JDG.20.36	Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten.
JDG.20.36	Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah. 
JDG.20.37	Those who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword. 
JDG.20.38	The Israelites had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city, 
JDG.20.39	and then the Israelites would counterattack.
JDG.20.39	The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the Israelites (about thirty), and they said, “We are defeating them as in the first battle.” 
JDG.20.40	But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the whole city going up in smoke. 
JDG.20.41	Then the Israelites counterattacked, and the Benjamites were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come on them. 
JDG.20.42	So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the wilderness, but they could not escape the battle. And the Israelites who came out of the towns cut them down there. 
JDG.20.43	They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily
JDG.20.44	Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters. 
JDG.20.45	As they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads. They kept pressing after the Benjamites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more.
JDG.20.46	On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters. 
JDG.20.47	But six hundred of them turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months. 
JDG.20.48	The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. All the towns they came across they set on fire.
JDG.21.1	The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah: “Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.”
JDG.21.2	The people went to Bethel,
JDG.21.3	“
JDG.21.4	Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
JDG.21.5	Then the Israelites asked, “Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the 
JDG.21.6	Now the Israelites grieved for the tribe of Benjamin, their fellow Israelites. “Today one tribe is cut off from Israel,” they said. 
JDG.21.7	“How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the 
JDG.21.8	Then they asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the 
JDG.21.9	For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.
JDG.21.10	So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children. 
JDG.21.11	“This is what you are to do,” they said. “Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin.” 
JDG.21.12	They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.
JDG.21.13	Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon. 
JDG.21.14	So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.
JDG.21.15	The people grieved for Benjamin, because the 
JDG.21.16	And the elders of the assembly said, “With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left? 
JDG.21.17	The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said, “so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out. 
JDG.21.18	We can’t give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: ‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’ 
JDG.21.19	But look, there is the annual festival of the 
JDG.21.20	So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards 
JDG.21.21	and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Do us the favor of helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war. You will not be guilty of breaking your oath because you did not give your daughters to them.’ ”
JDG.21.23	So that is what the Benjamites did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.
JDG.21.24	At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.
JDG.21.25	In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit.
RUT.1.1	In the days when the judges ruled,
RUT.1.2	The man’s name was Elimelek, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.
RUT.1.3	Now Elimelek, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, 
RUT.1.5	both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.
RUT.1.6	When Naomi heard in Moab that the 
RUT.1.7	With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.
RUT.1.8	Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you, to your mother’s home. May the 
RUT.1.9	May the 
RUT.1.9	Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud 
RUT.1.10	and said to her, “We will go back with you to your people.”
RUT.1.11	But Naomi said, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? 
RUT.1.12	Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons— 
RUT.1.13	would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the 
RUT.1.14	At this they wept aloud again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.
RUT.1.15	“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.”
RUT.1.16	But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. 
RUT.1.17	Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the 
RUT.1.18	When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
RUT.1.19	So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?”
RUT.1.20	“Don’t call me Naomi,
RUT.1.21	I went away full, but the 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
RUT.2.1	Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelek, whose name was Boaz.
RUT.2.2	And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.”
RUT.2.2	Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.” 
RUT.2.3	So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek.
RUT.2.4	Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, “The 
RUT.2.4	“The 
RUT.2.5	Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters, “Who does that young woman belong to?”
RUT.2.6	The overseer replied, “She is the Moabite who came back from Moab with Naomi. 
RUT.2.7	She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.’ She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.”
RUT.2.8	So Boaz said to Ruth, “My daughter, listen to me. Don’t go and glean in another field and don’t go away from here. Stay here with the women who work for me. 
RUT.2.9	Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.”
RUT.2.10	At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me—a foreigner?”
RUT.2.11	Boaz replied, “I’ve been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband—how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before. 
RUT.2.12	May the 
RUT.2.13	“May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,” she said. “You have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant—though I do not have the standing of one of your servants.”
RUT.2.14	At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.”
RUT.2.14	When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over. 
RUT.2.15	As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, “Let her gather among the sheaves and don’t reprimand her. 
RUT.2.16	Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don’t rebuke her.”
RUT.2.17	So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.
RUT.2.18	She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.
RUT.2.19	Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!”
RUT.2.19	Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said.
RUT.2.20	“The 
RUT.2.21	Then Ruth the Moabite said, “He even said to me, ‘Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.’ ”
RUT.2.22	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with the women who work for him, because in someone else’s field you might be harmed.”
RUT.2.23	So Ruth stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, I must find a home
RUT.3.2	Now Boaz, with whose women you have worked, is a relative of ours. Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor. 
RUT.3.3	Wash, put on perfume, and get dressed in your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don’t let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do.”
RUT.3.5	“I will do whatever you say,” Ruth answered. 
RUT.3.6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.
RUT.3.7	When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down. 
RUT.3.8	In the middle of the night something startled the man; he turned—and there was a woman lying at his feet!
RUT.3.9	“Who are you?” he asked.
RUT.3.9	“I am your servant Ruth,” she said. “Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a guardian-redeemer
RUT.3.10	“The 
RUT.3.11	And now, my daughter, don’t be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character. 
RUT.3.12	Although it is true that I am a guardian-redeemer of our family, there is another who is more closely related than I. 
RUT.3.13	Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to do his duty as your guardian-redeemer, good; let him redeem you. But if he is not willing, as surely as the 
RUT.3.14	So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor.”
RUT.3.15	He also said, “Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and placed the bundle on her. Then he
RUT.3.16	When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “How did it go, my daughter?”
RUT.3.16	Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her 
RUT.3.17	and added, “He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, ‘Don’t go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’ ”
RUT.3.18	Then Naomi said, “Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today.”
RUT.4.1	Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat down there just as the guardian-redeemer
RUT.4.2	Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, “Sit here,” and they did so. 
RUT.4.3	Then he said to the guardian-redeemer, “Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelek. 
RUT.4.4	I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you
RUT.4.4	“I will redeem it,” he said.
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the
RUT.4.6	At this, the guardian-redeemer said, “Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it.”
RUT.4.7	(Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)
RUT.4.8	So the guardian-redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it yourself.” And he removed his sandal.
RUT.4.9	Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, “Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelek, Kilion and Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from his hometown. Today you are witnesses!”
RUT.4.11	Then the elders and all the people at the gate said, “We are witnesses. May the 
RUT.4.12	Through the offspring the 
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When he made love to her, the 
RUT.4.14	The women said to Naomi: “Praise be to the 
RUT.4.15	He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.”
RUT.4.16	Then Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him. 
RUT.4.17	The women living there said, “Naomi has a son!” And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
RUT.4.18	This, then, is the family line of Perez:
RUT.4.18	Perez was the father of Hezron,
RUT.4.19	Hezron the father of Ram,
RUT.4.19	Ram the father of Amminadab,
RUT.4.20	Amminadab the father of Nahshon,
RUT.4.20	Nahshon the father of Salmon,
RUT.4.21	Salmon the father of Boaz,
RUT.4.21	Boaz the father of Obed,
RUT.4.22	Obed the father of Jesse,
RUT.4.22	and Jesse the father of David.
1SA.1.1	There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite
1SA.1.2	He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
1SA.1.3	Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the 
1SA.1.4	Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. 
1SA.1.5	But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the 
1SA.1.6	Because the 
1SA.1.7	This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the 
1SA.1.8	Her husband Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?”
1SA.1.9	Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the 
1SA.1.10	In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the 
1SA.1.11	And she made a vow, saying, “
1SA.1.12	As she kept on praying to the 
1SA.1.13	Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk 
1SA.1.14	and said to her, “How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away your wine.”
1SA.1.15	“Not so, my lord,” Hannah replied, “I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the 
1SA.1.16	Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.”
1SA.1.17	Eli answered, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.”
1SA.1.18	She said, “May your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.
1SA.1.19	Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the 
1SA.1.20	So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,
1SA.1.21	When her husband Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the 
1SA.1.22	Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, “After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the 
1SA.1.23	“Do what seems best to you,” her husband Elkanah told her. “Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the 
1SA.1.24	After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull,
1SA.1.25	When the bull had been sacrificed, they brought the boy to Eli, 
1SA.1.26	and she said to him, “Pardon me, my lord. As surely as you live, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the 
1SA.1.27	I prayed for this child, and the 
1SA.1.28	So now I give him to the 
1SA.2.1	Then Hannah prayed and said:
1SA.2.1	“My heart rejoices in the 
1SA.2.1	in the 
1SA.2.1	My mouth boasts over my enemies,
1SA.2.1	for I delight in your deliverance.
1SA.2.2	“There is no one holy like the 
1SA.2.2	there is no one besides you;
1SA.2.2	there is no Rock like our God.
1SA.2.3	“Do not keep talking so proudly
1SA.2.3	or let your mouth speak such arrogance,
1SA.2.3	for the 
1SA.2.3	and by him deeds are weighed.
1SA.2.4	“The bows of the warriors are broken,
1SA.2.4	but those who stumbled are armed with strength.
1SA.2.5	Those who were full hire themselves out for food,
1SA.2.5	but those who were hungry are hungry no more.
1SA.2.5	She who was barren has borne seven children,
1SA.2.5	but she who has had many sons pines away.
1SA.2.6	“The 
1SA.2.6	he brings down to the grave and raises up.
1SA.2.7	The 
1SA.2.7	he humbles and he exalts.
1SA.2.8	He raises the poor from the dust
1SA.2.8	and lifts the needy from the ash heap;
1SA.2.8	he seats them with princes
1SA.2.8	and has them inherit a throne of honor.
1SA.2.8	“For the foundations of the earth are the 
1SA.2.8	on them he has set the world.
1SA.2.9	He will guard the feet of his faithful servants,
1SA.2.9	but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness.
1SA.2.9	“It is not by strength that one prevails;
1SA.2.10	those who oppose the 
1SA.2.10	The Most High will thunder from heaven;
1SA.2.10	the 
1SA.2.10	“He will give strength to his king
1SA.2.10	and exalt the horn of his anointed.”
1SA.2.11	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the 
1SA.2.12	Eli’s sons were scoundrels; they had no regard for the 
1SA.2.13	Now it was the practice of the priests that, whenever any of the people offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being boiled 
1SA.2.14	and would plunge the fork into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. 
1SA.2.15	But even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the person who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast; he won’t accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”
1SA.2.16	If the person said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want,” the servant would answer, “No, hand it over now; if you don’t, I’ll take it by force.”
1SA.2.17	This sin of the young men was very great in the 
1SA.2.18	But Samuel was ministering before the 
1SA.2.19	Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. 
1SA.2.20	Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the 
1SA.2.21	And the 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
1SA.2.23	So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among the 
1SA.2.25	If one person sins against another, God
1SA.2.26	And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the 
1SA.2.27	Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the 
1SA.2.28	I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor’s family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites. 
1SA.2.29	Why do you
1SA.2.30	“Therefore the 
1SA.2.31	The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age, 
1SA.2.32	and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age. 
1SA.2.33	Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.
1SA.2.34	“ ‘And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you—they will both die on the same day. 
1SA.2.35	I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his priestly house, and they will minister before my anointed one always. 
1SA.2.36	Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, “Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.” ’ ”
1SA.3.1	The boy Samuel ministered before the 
1SA.3.2	One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place. 
1SA.3.3	The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the 
1SA.3.4	Then the 
1SA.3.4	Samuel answered, “Here I am.” 
1SA.3.5	And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”
1SA.3.5	But Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.
1SA.3.6	Again the 
1SA.3.6	“My son,” Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.”
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know the 
1SA.3.8	A third time the 
1SA.3.8	Then Eli realized that the 
1SA.3.9	So Eli told Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, ‘Speak, 
1SA.3.10	The 
1SA.3.10	Then Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”
1SA.3.11	And the 
1SA.3.12	At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family—from beginning to end. 
1SA.3.13	For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God,
1SA.3.14	Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, ‘The guilt of Eli’s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’ ”
1SA.3.15	Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the 
1SA.3.16	but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.”
1SA.3.16	Samuel answered, “Here I am.”
1SA.3.17	“What was it he said to you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.” 
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, “He is the 
1SA.3.19	The 
1SA.3.20	And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the 
1SA.3.21	The 
1SA.4.1	And Samuel’s word came to all Israel.
1SA.4.1	Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek. 
1SA.4.2	The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield. 
1SA.4.3	When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the 
1SA.4.4	So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.5	When the ark of the 
1SA.4.6	Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, “What’s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?”
1SA.4.6	When they learned that the ark of the 
1SA.4.7	the Philistines were afraid. “A god has
1SA.4.8	We’re doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 
1SA.4.9	Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!”
1SA.4.10	So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers. 
1SA.4.11	The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
1SA.4.12	That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head. 
1SA.4.13	When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry.
1SA.4.14	Eli heard the outcry and asked, “What is the meaning of this uproar?”
1SA.4.14	The man hurried over to Eli, 
1SA.4.15	who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see. 
1SA.4.16	He told Eli, “I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day.”
1SA.4.16	Eli asked, “What happened, my son?”
1SA.4.17	The man who brought the news replied, “Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”
1SA.4.18	When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led
1SA.4.19	His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains. 
1SA.4.20	As she was dying, the women attending her said, “Don’t despair; you have given birth to a son.” But she did not respond or pay any attention.
1SA.4.21	She named the boy Ichabod,
1SA.4.22	She said, “The Glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”
1SA.5.1	After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	Then they carried the ark into Dagon’s temple and set it beside Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.4	But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.5	That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon’s temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.
1SA.5.6	The 
1SA.5.7	When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.” 
1SA.5.8	So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, “What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?”
1SA.5.8	They answered, “Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.
1SA.5.9	But after they had moved it, the 
1SA.5.10	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.
1SA.5.10	As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.” 
1SA.5.11	So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, “Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it
1SA.5.12	Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	When the ark of the 
1SA.6.2	the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the 
1SA.6.3	They answered, “If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift; by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you.”
1SA.6.4	The Philistines asked, “What guilt offering should we send to him?”
1SA.6.4	They replied, “Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers. 
1SA.6.5	Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give glory to Israel’s god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land. 
1SA.6.6	Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel’s god dealt harshly with them, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?
1SA.6.7	“Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up. 
1SA.6.8	Take the ark of the 
1SA.6.9	but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the 
1SA.6.10	So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves. 
1SA.6.11	They placed the ark of the 
1SA.6.12	Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.
1SA.6.13	Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight. 
1SA.6.14	The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the 
1SA.6.15	The Levites took down the ark of the 
1SA.6.16	The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.
1SA.6.17	These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the 
1SA.6.18	And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers—the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of the 
1SA.6.19	But God struck down some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy
1SA.6.20	And the people of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who can stand in the presence of the 
1SA.6.21	Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the 
1SA.7.1	So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the 
1SA.7.2	The ark remained at Kiriath Jearim a long time—twenty years in all.
1SA.7.2	Then all the people of Israel turned back to the 
1SA.7.3	So Samuel said to all the Israelites, “If you are returning to the 
1SA.7.4	So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the 
1SA.7.5	Then Samuel said, “Assemble all Israel at Mizpah, and I will intercede with the 
1SA.7.6	When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the 
1SA.7.7	When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines. 
1SA.7.8	They said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the 
1SA.7.9	Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to the 
1SA.7.10	While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the 
1SA.7.11	The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Kar.
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer,
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued and they stopped invading Israel’s territory. Throughout Samuel’s lifetime, the hand of the 
1SA.7.14	The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to Israel, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	Samuel continued as Israel’s leader all the days of his life. 
1SA.7.16	From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places. 
1SA.7.17	But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also held court for Israel. And he built an altar there to the 
1SA.8.1	When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as Israel’s leaders.
1SA.8.2	The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	But his sons did not follow his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice.
1SA.8.4	So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. 
1SA.8.5	They said to him, “You are old, and your sons do not follow your ways; now appoint a king to lead
1SA.8.6	But when they said, “Give us a king to lead us,” this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the 
1SA.8.7	And the 
1SA.8.8	As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you. 
1SA.8.9	Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights.”
1SA.8.10	Samuel told all the words of the 
1SA.8.11	He said, “This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots. 
1SA.8.12	Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. 
1SA.8.13	He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. 
1SA.8.14	He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants. 
1SA.8.15	He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants. 
1SA.8.16	Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle
1SA.8.17	He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves. 
1SA.8.18	When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the 
1SA.8.19	But the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king over us. 
1SA.8.20	Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.”
1SA.8.21	When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the 
1SA.8.22	The 
1SA.8.22	Then Samuel said to the Israelites, “Everyone go back to your own town.”
1SA.9.1	There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. 
1SA.9.2	Kish had a son named Saul, as handsome a young man as could be found anywhere in Israel, and he was a head taller than anyone else.
1SA.9.3	Now the donkeys belonging to Saul’s father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.” 
1SA.9.4	So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.
1SA.9.5	When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, “Come, let’s go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”
1SA.9.6	But the servant replied, “Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let’s go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take.”
1SA.9.7	Saul said to his servant, “If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?”
1SA.9.8	The servant answered him again. “Look,” he said, “I have a quarter of a shekel
1SA.9.9	(Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, “Come, let us go to the seer,” because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)
1SA.9.10	“Good,” Saul said to his servant. “Come, let’s go.” So they set out for the town where the man of God was.
1SA.9.11	As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them, “Is the seer here?”
1SA.9.12	“He is,” they answered. “He’s ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place. 
1SA.9.13	As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time.”
1SA.9.14	They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.
1SA.9.15	Now the day before Saul came, the 
1SA.9.16	“About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked on my people, for their cry has reached me.”
1SA.9.17	When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?”
1SA.9.19	“I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart. 
1SA.9.20	As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and your whole family line?”
1SA.9.21	Saul answered, “But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?”
1SA.9.22	Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited—about thirty in number. 
1SA.9.23	Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside.”
1SA.9.24	So the cook took up the thigh with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, “Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said, ‘I have invited guests.’ ” And Saul dined with Samuel that day.
1SA.9.25	After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house. 
1SA.9.26	They rose about daybreak, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your way.” When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together. 
1SA.9.27	As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us”—and the servant did so—“but you stay here for a while, so that I may give you a message from God.”
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it on Saul’s head and kissed him, saying, “Has not the 
1SA.10.2	When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel’s tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, “What shall I do about my son?” ’
1SA.10.3	“Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine. 
1SA.10.4	They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.
1SA.10.5	“After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, timbrels, pipes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying. 
1SA.10.6	The Spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.
1SA.10.8	“Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do.”
1SA.10.9	As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day. 
1SA.10.10	When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he joined in their prophesying. 
1SA.10.11	When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”
1SA.10.12	A man who lived there answered, “And who is their father?” So it became a saying: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.13	After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.
1SA.10.14	Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where have you been?”
1SA.10.14	“Looking for the donkeys,” he said. “But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”
1SA.10.15	Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”
1SA.10.16	Saul replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.
1SA.10.17	Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the 
1SA.10.18	and said to them, “This is what the 
1SA.10.19	But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities. And you have said, ‘No, appoint a king over us.’ So now present yourselves before the 
1SA.10.20	When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. 
1SA.10.21	Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri’s clan was taken. Finally Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found. 
1SA.10.22	So they inquired further of the 
1SA.10.22	And the 
1SA.10.23	They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others. 
1SA.10.24	Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the man the 
1SA.10.24	Then the people shouted, “Long live the king!”
1SA.10.25	Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the 
1SA.10.26	Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched. 
1SA.10.27	But some scoundrels said, “How can this fellow save us?” They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent.
1SA.11.1	Nahash
1SA.11.2	But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel.”
1SA.11.3	The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you.”
1SA.11.4	When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people, they all wept aloud. 
1SA.11.5	Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, “What is wrong with everyone? Why are they weeping?” Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said.
1SA.11.6	When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he burned with anger. 
1SA.11.7	He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel.” Then the terror of the 
1SA.11.8	When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and those of Judah thirty thousand.
1SA.11.9	They told the messengers who had come, “Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be rescued.’ ” When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated. 
1SA.11.10	They said to the Ammonites, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you like.”
1SA.11.11	The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
1SA.11.12	The people then said to Samuel, “Who was it that asked, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Turn these men over to us so that we may put them to death.”
1SA.11.13	But Saul said, “No one will be put to death today, for this day the 
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingship.” 
1SA.11.15	So all the people went to Gilgal and made Saul king in the presence of the 
1SA.12.1	Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day. 
1SA.12.3	Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the 
1SA.12.4	“You have not cheated or oppressed us,” they replied. “You have not taken anything from anyone’s hand.”
1SA.12.5	Samuel said to them, “The 
1SA.12.5	“He is witness,” they said.
1SA.12.6	Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the 
1SA.12.7	Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the 
1SA.12.8	“After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the 
1SA.12.9	“But they forgot the 
1SA.12.10	They cried out to the 
1SA.12.11	Then the 
1SA.12.12	“But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, ‘No, we want a king to rule over us’—even though the 
1SA.12.13	Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the 
1SA.12.14	If you fear the 
1SA.12.15	But if you do not obey the 
1SA.12.16	“Now then, stand still and see this great thing the 
1SA.12.17	Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on the 
1SA.12.18	Then Samuel called on the 
1SA.12.19	The people all said to Samuel, “Pray to the 
1SA.12.20	“Do not be afraid,” Samuel replied. “You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the 
1SA.12.21	Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless. 
1SA.12.22	For the sake of his great name the 
1SA.12.23	As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the 
1SA.12.24	But be sure to fear the 
1SA.12.25	Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will perish.”
1SA.13.1	Saul was thirty
1SA.13.2	Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Mikmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes.
1SA.13.3	Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, “Let the Hebrews hear!” 
1SA.13.4	So all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious to the Philistines.” And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand
1SA.13.6	When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns. 
1SA.13.7	Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.
1SA.13.7	Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear. 
1SA.13.8	He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul’s men began to scatter. 
1SA.13.9	So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” And Saul offered up the burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.
1SA.13.11	“What have you done?” asked Samuel.
1SA.13.11	Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash, 
1SA.13.12	I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the 
1SA.13.13	“You have done a foolish thing,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the 
1SA.13.14	But now your kingdom will not endure; the 
1SA.13.15	Then Samuel left Gilgal
1SA.13.16	Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah
1SA.13.17	Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual, 
1SA.13.18	another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboyim facing the wilderness.
1SA.13.19	Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!” 
1SA.13.20	So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes and sickles
1SA.13.21	The price was two-thirds of a shekel
1SA.13.22	So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
1SA.13.23	Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Mikmash.
1SA.14.1	One day Jonathan son of Saul said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.
1SA.14.2	Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men, 
1SA.14.3	among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the 
1SA.14.4	On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez and the other Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	One cliff stood to the north toward Mikmash, the other to the south toward Geba.
1SA.14.6	Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps the 
1SA.14.7	“Do all that you have in mind,” his armor-bearer said. “Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.”
1SA.14.8	Jonathan said, “Come on, then; we will cross over toward them and let them see us. 
1SA.14.9	If they say to us, ‘Wait there until we come to you,’ we will stay where we are and not go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the 
1SA.14.11	So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. “Look!” said the Philistines. “The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in.” 
1SA.14.12	The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us and we’ll teach you a lesson.”
1SA.14.12	So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Climb up after me; the 
1SA.14.13	Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him. 
1SA.14.14	In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.
1SA.14.15	Then panic struck the whole army—those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties—and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.
1SA.14.16	Saul’s lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions. 
1SA.14.17	Then Saul said to the men who were with him, “Muster the forces and see who has left us.” When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.
1SA.14.18	Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God.” (At that time it was with the Israelites.)
1SA.14.19	While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”
1SA.14.20	Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords. 
1SA.14.21	Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
1SA.14.22	When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit. 
1SA.14.23	So on that day the 
1SA.14.24	Now the Israelites were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, “Cursed be anyone who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the troops tasted food.
1SA.14.25	The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground. 
1SA.14.26	When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out; yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath. 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.
1SA.14.28	Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, ‘Cursed be anyone who eats food today!’ That is why the men are faint.”
1SA.14.29	Jonathan said, “My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey. 
1SA.14.30	How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?”
1SA.14.31	That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Mikmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted. 
1SA.14.32	They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood. 
1SA.14.33	Then someone said to Saul, “Look, the men are sinning against the 
1SA.14.33	“You have broken faith,” he said. “Roll a large stone over here at once.” 
1SA.14.34	Then he said, “Go out among the men and tell them, ‘Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the 
1SA.14.34	So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there. 
1SA.14.35	Then Saul built an altar to the 
1SA.14.36	Saul said, “Let us go down and pursue the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive.”
1SA.14.36	“Do whatever seems best to you,” they replied.
1SA.14.36	But the priest said, “Let us inquire of God here.”
1SA.14.37	So Saul asked God, “Shall I go down and pursue the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel’s hand?” But God did not answer him that day.
1SA.14.38	Saul therefore said, “Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today. 
1SA.14.39	As surely as the 
1SA.14.40	Saul then said to all the Israelites, “You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here.”
1SA.14.40	“Do what seems best to you,” they replied.
1SA.14.41	Then Saul prayed to the 
1SA.14.42	Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken.
1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.”
1SA.14.43	So Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now I must die!”
1SA.14.44	Saul said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan.”
1SA.14.45	But the men said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die—he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.
1SA.14.47	After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings
1SA.14.48	He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.
1SA.14.49	Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal. 
1SA.14.50	His wife’s name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul’s army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul’s uncle. 
1SA.14.51	Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.
1SA.15.1	Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the 
1SA.15.2	This is what the 
1SA.15.3	Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy
1SA.15.4	So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim—two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. 
1SA.15.5	Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine. 
1SA.15.6	Then he said to the Kenites, “Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
1SA.15.7	Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt. 
1SA.15.8	He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword. 
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves
1SA.15.10	Then the word of the 
1SA.15.11	“I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.” Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the 
1SA.15.12	Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal.”
1SA.15.13	When Samuel reached him, Saul said, “The 
1SA.15.14	But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?”
1SA.15.15	Saul answered, “The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.16	“Enough!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what the 
1SA.15.16	“Tell me,” Saul replied.
1SA.15.17	Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The 
1SA.15.18	And he sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.’ 
1SA.15.19	Why did you not obey the 
1SA.15.20	“But I did obey the 
1SA.15.21	The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the 
1SA.15.22	But Samuel replied:
1SA.15.22	“Does the 
1SA.15.22	as much as in obeying the 
1SA.15.22	To obey is better than sacrifice,
1SA.15.22	and to heed is better than the fat of rams.
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is like the sin of divination,
1SA.15.23	and arrogance like the evil of idolatry.
1SA.15.23	Because you have rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.23	he has rejected you as king.”
1SA.15.24	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned. I violated the 
1SA.15.25	Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the 
1SA.15.26	But Samuel said to him, “I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.27	As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. 
1SA.15.28	Samuel said to him, “The 
1SA.15.29	He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind.”
1SA.15.30	Saul replied, “I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the 
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.”
1SA.15.32	Agag came to him in chains.
1SA.15.33	But Samuel said,
1SA.15.33	“As your sword has made women childless,
1SA.15.33	so will your mother be childless among women.”
1SA.15.33	And Samuel put Agag to death before the 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the 
1SA.16.1	The 
1SA.16.2	But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.”
1SA.16.2	The 
1SA.16.3	Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.”
1SA.16.4	Samuel did what the 
1SA.16.5	Samuel replied, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the 
1SA.16.6	When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, “Surely the 
1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, “The 
1SA.16.9	Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, “Nor has the 
1SA.16.10	Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, “The 
1SA.16.11	So he asked Jesse, “Are these all the sons you have?”
1SA.16.11	“There is still the youngest,” Jesse answered. “He is tending the sheep.”
1SA.16.11	Samuel said, “Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives.”
1SA.16.12	So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features.
1SA.16.12	Then the 
1SA.16.13	So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.14	Now the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	Saul’s attendants said to him, “See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
1SA.16.16	Let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the lyre. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes on you, and you will feel better.”
1SA.16.17	So Saul said to his attendants, “Find someone who plays well and bring him to me.”
1SA.16.18	One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the 
1SA.16.19	Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.” 
1SA.16.20	So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul.
1SA.16.21	David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers. 
1SA.16.22	Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Allow David to remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.”
1SA.16.23	Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Sokoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Sokoh and Azekah. 
1SA.17.2	Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them.
1SA.17.4	A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His height was six cubits and a span.
1SA.17.5	He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels
1SA.17.6	on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. 
1SA.17.7	His spear shaft was like a weaver’s rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels.
1SA.17.8	Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. 
1SA.17.9	If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.” 
1SA.17.10	Then the Philistine said, “This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.” 
1SA.17.11	On hearing the Philistine’s words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul’s time he was very old. 
1SA.17.13	Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. 
1SA.17.14	David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, 
1SA.17.15	but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.
1SA.17.16	For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand.
1SA.17.17	Now Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah
1SA.17.18	Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance
1SA.17.19	They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.”
1SA.17.20	Early in the morning David left the flock in the care of a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. 
1SA.17.21	Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. 
1SA.17.22	David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were. 
1SA.17.23	As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. 
1SA.17.24	Whenever the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear.
1SA.17.25	Now the Israelites had been saying, “Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel.”
1SA.17.26	David asked the men standing near him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?”
1SA.17.27	They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, “This is what will be done for the man who kills him.”
1SA.17.28	When Eliab, David’s oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, “Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.”
1SA.17.29	“Now what have I done?” said David. “Can’t I even speak?” 
1SA.17.30	He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. 
1SA.17.31	What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him.
1SA.17.32	David said to Saul, “Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.”
1SA.17.33	Saul replied, “You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth.”
1SA.17.34	But David said to Saul, “Your servant has been keeping his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, 
1SA.17.35	I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. 
1SA.17.36	Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. 
1SA.17.37	The 
1SA.17.37	Saul said to David, “Go, and the 
1SA.17.38	Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. 
1SA.17.39	David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them.
1SA.17.39	“I cannot go in these,” he said to Saul, “because I am not used to them.” So he took them off. 
1SA.17.40	Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine.
1SA.17.41	Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. 
1SA.17.42	He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy, glowing with health and handsome, and he despised him. 
1SA.17.43	He said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
1SA.17.44	“Come here,” he said, “and I’ll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals!”
1SA.17.45	David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	This day the 
1SA.17.47	All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the 
1SA.17.48	As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. 
1SA.17.49	Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.
1SA.17.50	So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him.
1SA.17.51	David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine’s sword and drew it from the sheath. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword.
1SA.17.51	When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. 
1SA.17.52	Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath
1SA.17.53	When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp.
1SA.17.54	David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem; he put the Philistine’s weapons in his own tent.
1SA.17.55	As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is that young man?”
1SA.17.55	Abner replied, “As surely as you live, Your Majesty, I don’t know.”
1SA.17.56	The king said, “Find out whose son this young man is.”
1SA.17.57	As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine’s head.
1SA.17.58	“Whose son are you, young man?” Saul asked him.
1SA.17.58	David said, “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.”
1SA.18.1	After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself. 
1SA.18.2	From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family. 
1SA.18.3	And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. 
1SA.18.4	Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.
1SA.18.5	Whatever mission Saul sent him on, David was so successful that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the troops, and Saul’s officers as well.
1SA.18.6	When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with timbrels and lyres. 
1SA.18.7	As they danced, they sang:
1SA.18.7	“Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.18.7	and David his tens of thousands.”
1SA.18.8	Saul was very angry; this refrain displeased him greatly. “They have credited David with tens of thousands,” he thought, “but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?” 
1SA.18.9	And from that time on Saul kept a close eye on David.
1SA.18.10	The next day an evil
1SA.18.11	and he hurled it, saying to himself, “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice.
1SA.18.12	Saul was afraid of David, because the 
1SA.18.13	So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns. 
1SA.18.14	In everything he did he had great success, because the 
1SA.18.15	When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him. 
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.
1SA.18.17	Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the 
1SA.18.18	But David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my family or my clan in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?” 
1SA.18.19	So
1SA.18.20	Now Saul’s daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased. 
1SA.18.21	“I will give her to him,” he thought, “so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law.”
1SA.18.22	Then Saul ordered his attendants: “Speak to David privately and say, ‘Look, the king likes you, and his attendants all love you; now become his son-in-law.’ ”
1SA.18.23	They repeated these words to David. But David said, “Do you think it is a small matter to become the king’s son-in-law? I’m only a poor man and little known.”
1SA.18.24	When Saul’s servants told him what David had said, 
1SA.18.25	Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.’ ” Saul’s plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.
1SA.18.26	When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed, 
1SA.18.27	David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins. They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.
1SA.18.28	When Saul realized that the 
1SA.18.29	Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.
1SA.18.30	The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul’s officers, and his name became well known.
1SA.19.1	Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan had taken a great liking to David 
1SA.19.2	and warned him, “My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there. 
1SA.19.3	I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I’ll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out.”
1SA.19.4	Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly. 
1SA.19.5	He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The 
1SA.19.6	Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: “As surely as the 
1SA.19.7	So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.
1SA.19.8	Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.
1SA.19.9	But an evil
1SA.19.10	Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.
1SA.19.11	Saul sent men to David’s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, warned him, “If you don’t run for your life tonight, tomorrow you’ll be killed.” 
1SA.19.12	So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats’ hair at the head.
1SA.19.14	When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, “He is ill.”
1SA.19.15	Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, “Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him.” 
1SA.19.16	But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats’ hair.
1SA.19.17	Saul said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?”
1SA.19.17	Michal told him, “He said to me, ‘Let me get away. Why should I kill you?’ ”
1SA.19.18	When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there. 
1SA.19.19	Word came to Saul: “David is in Naioth at Ramah”; 
1SA.19.20	so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came on Saul’s men, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.21	Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.22	Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Seku. And he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?”
1SA.19.22	“Over in Naioth at Ramah,” they said.
1SA.19.23	So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even on him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth. 
1SA.19.24	He stripped off his garments, and he too prophesied in Samuel’s presence. He lay naked all that day and all that night. This is why people say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
1SA.20.1	Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to kill me?”
1SA.20.2	“Never!” Jonathan replied. “You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn’t do anything, great or small, without letting me know. Why would he hide this from me? It isn’t so!”
1SA.20.3	But David took an oath and said, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.’ Yet as surely as the 
1SA.20.4	Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do for you.”
1SA.20.5	So David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon feast, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow. 
1SA.20.6	If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.’ 
1SA.20.7	If he says, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me. 
1SA.20.8	As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the 
1SA.20.9	“Never!” Jonathan said. “If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you?”
1SA.20.10	David asked, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”
1SA.20.11	“Come,” Jonathan said, “let’s go out into the field.” So they went there together.
1SA.20.12	Then Jonathan said to David, “I swear by the 
1SA.20.13	But if my father intends to harm you, may the 
1SA.20.14	But show me unfailing kindness like the 
1SA.20.15	and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family—not even when the 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the 
1SA.20.17	And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon feast. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty. 
1SA.20.19	The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel. 
1SA.20.20	I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. 
1SA.20.21	Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,’ then come, because, as surely as the 
1SA.20.22	But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, because the 
1SA.20.23	And about the matter you and I discussed—remember, the 
1SA.20.24	So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon feast came, the king sat down to eat. 
1SA.20.25	He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan,
1SA.20.26	Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, “Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.” 
1SA.20.27	But the next day, the second day of the month, David’s place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”
1SA.20.28	Jonathan answered, “David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem. 
1SA.20.29	He said, ‘Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”
1SA.20.30	Saul’s anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you? 
1SA.20.31	As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die!”
1SA.20.32	“Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” Jonathan asked his father. 
1SA.20.33	But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.
1SA.20.34	Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the feast he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father’s shameful treatment of David.
1SA.20.35	In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him, 
1SA.20.36	and he said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 
1SA.20.37	When the boy came to the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” 
1SA.20.38	Then he shouted, “Hurry! Go quickly! Don’t stop!” The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master. 
1SA.20.39	(The boy knew nothing about all this; only Jonathan and David knew.) 
1SA.20.40	Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, “Go, carry them back to town.”
1SA.20.41	After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together—but David wept the most.
1SA.20.42	Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the 
1SA.21.1	David went to Nob, to Ahimelek the priest. Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”
1SA.21.2	David answered Ahimelek the priest, “The king sent me on a mission and said to me, ‘No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.’ As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. 
1SA.21.3	Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.”
1SA.21.4	But the priest answered David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here—provided the men have kept themselves from women.”
1SA.21.5	David replied, “Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the 
1SA.21.7	Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the 
1SA.21.8	David asked Ahimelek, “Don’t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven’t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king’s mission was urgent.”
1SA.21.9	The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.”
1SA.21.9	David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”
1SA.21.10	That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	But the servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances:
1SA.21.11	“ ‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.21.11	and David his tens of thousands’?”
1SA.21.12	David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. 
1SA.21.13	So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.
1SA.21.14	Achish said to his servants, “Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me? 
1SA.21.15	Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?”
1SA.22.1	David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there. 
1SA.22.2	All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their commander. About four hundred men were with him.
1SA.22.3	From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?” 
1SA.22.4	So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.
1SA.22.5	But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
1SA.22.6	Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul was seated, spear in hand, under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing at his side. 
1SA.22.7	He said to them, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? 
1SA.22.8	Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today.”
1SA.22.9	But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s officials, said, “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek son of Ahitub at Nob. 
1SA.22.10	Ahimelek inquired of the 
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and all the men of his family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king. 
1SA.22.12	Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.”
1SA.22.12	“Yes, my lord,” he answered.
1SA.22.13	Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?”
1SA.22.14	Ahimelek answered the king, “Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king’s son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household? 
1SA.22.15	Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father’s family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair.”
1SA.22.16	But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelek, you and your whole family.”
1SA.22.17	Then the king ordered the guards at his side: “Turn and kill the priests of the 
1SA.22.17	But the king’s officials were unwilling to raise a hand to strike the priests of the 
1SA.22.18	The king then ordered Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests.” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. 
1SA.22.19	He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep.
1SA.22.20	But one son of Ahimelek son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to join David. 
1SA.22.21	He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the 
1SA.22.22	Then David said to Abiathar, “That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your whole family. 
1SA.22.23	Stay with me; don’t be afraid. The man who wants to kill you is trying to kill me too. You will be safe with me.”
1SA.23.1	When David was told, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,” 
1SA.23.2	he inquired of the 
1SA.23.2	The 
1SA.23.3	But David’s men said to him, “Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!”
1SA.23.4	Once again David inquired of the 
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah. 
1SA.23.6	(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelek had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)
1SA.23.7	Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, “God has delivered him into my hands, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars.” 
1SA.23.8	And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.
1SA.23.9	When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.” 
1SA.23.10	David said, “
1SA.23.11	Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? 
1SA.23.11	And the 
1SA.23.12	Again David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?”
1SA.23.12	And the 
1SA.23.13	So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.
1SA.23.14	David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands.
1SA.23.15	While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that
1SA.23.16	And Saul’s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God. 
1SA.23.17	“Don’t be afraid,” he said. “My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.” 
1SA.23.18	The two of them made a covenant before the 
1SA.23.19	The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon? 
1SA.23.20	Now, Your Majesty, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for giving him into your hands.”
1SA.23.21	Saul replied, “The 
1SA.23.22	Go and get more information. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty. 
1SA.23.23	Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah.”
1SA.23.24	So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.25	Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David.
1SA.23.26	Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them, 
1SA.23.27	a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land.” 
1SA.23.28	Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.
1SA.23.29	And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.
1SA.24.1	After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Desert of En Gedi.” 
1SA.24.2	So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.
1SA.24.3	He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. 
1SA.24.4	The men said, “This is the day the 
1SA.24.5	Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. 
1SA.24.6	He said to his men, “The 
1SA.24.7	With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.
1SA.24.8	Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. 
1SA.24.9	He said to Saul, “Why do you listen when men say, ‘David is bent on harming you’? 
1SA.24.10	This day you have seen with your own eyes how the 
1SA.24.11	See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. 
1SA.24.12	May the 
1SA.24.13	As the old saying goes, ‘From evildoers come evil deeds,’ so my hand will not touch you.
1SA.24.14	“Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? 
1SA.24.15	May the 
1SA.24.16	When David finished saying this, Saul asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” And he wept aloud. 
1SA.24.17	“You are more righteous than I,” he said. “You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. 
1SA.24.18	You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the 
1SA.24.19	When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the 
1SA.24.20	I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. 
1SA.24.21	Now swear to me by the 
1SA.24.22	So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
1SA.25.1	Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Paran.
1SA.25.2	A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. 
1SA.25.3	His name was Nabal and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings—he was a Calebite.
1SA.25.4	While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. 
1SA.25.5	So he sent ten young men and said to them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name. 
1SA.25.6	Say to him: ‘Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours!
1SA.25.7	“ ‘Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing. 
1SA.25.8	Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.’ ”
1SA.25.9	When David’s men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David’s name. Then they waited.
1SA.25.10	Nabal answered David’s servants, “Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days. 
1SA.25.11	Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?”
1SA.25.12	David’s men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word. 
1SA.25.13	David said to his men, “Each of you strap on your sword!” So they did, and David strapped his on as well. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.
1SA.25.14	One of the servants told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them. 
1SA.25.15	Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing. 
1SA.25.16	Night and day they were a wall around us the whole time we were herding our sheep near them. 
1SA.25.17	Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.”
1SA.25.18	Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs
1SA.25.19	Then she told her servants, “Go on ahead; I’ll follow you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
1SA.25.20	As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them. 
1SA.25.21	David had just said, “It’s been useless—all my watching over this fellow’s property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good. 
1SA.25.22	May God deal with David,
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground. 
1SA.25.24	She fell at his feet and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, and let me speak to you; hear what your servant has to say. 
1SA.25.25	Please pay no attention, my lord, to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name—his name means Fool, and folly goes with him. And as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my lord sent. 
1SA.25.26	And now, my lord, as surely as the 
1SA.25.27	And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the men who follow you.
1SA.25.28	“Please forgive your servant’s presumption. The 
1SA.25.29	Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the 
1SA.25.30	When the 
1SA.25.31	my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the 
1SA.25.32	David said to Abigail, “Praise be to the 
1SA.25.33	May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands. 
1SA.25.34	Otherwise, as surely as the 
1SA.25.35	Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, “Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.”
1SA.25.36	When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak. 
1SA.25.37	Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone. 
1SA.25.38	About ten days later, the 
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise be to the 
1SA.25.39	Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife. 
1SA.25.40	His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, “David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife.”
1SA.25.41	She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, “I am your servant and am ready to serve you and wash the feet of my lord’s servants.” 
1SA.25.42	Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five female servants, went with David’s messengers and became his wife. 
1SA.25.43	David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives. 
1SA.25.44	But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Paltiel
1SA.26.1	The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?”
1SA.26.2	So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand select Israelite troops, to search there for David. 
1SA.26.3	Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul had followed him there, 
1SA.26.4	he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived.
1SA.26.5	Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him.
1SA.26.6	David then asked Ahimelek the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?”
1SA.26.6	“I’ll go with you,” said Abishai.
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.
1SA.26.8	Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won’t strike him twice.”
1SA.26.9	But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the 
1SA.26.10	As surely as the 
1SA.26.11	But the 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and water jug near Saul’s head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the 
1SA.26.13	Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them. 
1SA.26.14	He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, “Aren’t you going to answer me, Abner?”
1SA.26.14	Abner replied, “Who are you who calls to the king?”
1SA.26.15	David said, “You’re a man, aren’t you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn’t you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king. 
1SA.26.16	What you have done is not good. As surely as the 
1SA.26.17	Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is that your voice, David my son?”
1SA.26.17	David replied, “Yes it is, my lord the king.” 
1SA.26.18	And he added, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of? 
1SA.26.19	Now let my lord the king listen to his servant’s words. If the 
1SA.26.20	Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the 
1SA.26.21	Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have been terribly wrong.”
1SA.26.22	“Here is the king’s spear,” David answered. “Let one of your young men come over and get it. 
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	As surely as I valued your life today, so may the 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, “May you be blessed, David my son; you will do great things and surely triumph.”
1SA.26.25	So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.
1SA.27.1	But David thought to himself, “One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand.”
1SA.27.2	So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maok king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal. 
1SA.27.4	When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.
1SA.27.5	Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”
1SA.27.6	So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since. 
1SA.27.7	David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months.
1SA.27.8	Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.) 
1SA.27.9	Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.
1SA.27.10	When Achish asked, “Where did you go raiding today?” David would say, “Against the Negev of Judah” or “Against the Negev of Jerahmeel” or “Against the Negev of the Kenites.” 
1SA.27.11	He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, “They might inform on us and say, ‘This is what David did.’ ” And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory. 
1SA.27.12	Achish trusted David and said to himself, “He has become so obnoxious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant for life.”
1SA.28.1	In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army.”
1SA.28.2	David said, “Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do.”
1SA.28.2	Achish replied, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
1SA.28.3	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.
1SA.28.4	The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart. 
1SA.28.6	He inquired of the 
1SA.28.7	Saul then said to his attendants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her.”
1SA.28.7	“There is one in Endor,” they said.
1SA.28.8	So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. “Consult a spirit for me,” he said, “and bring up for me the one I name.”
1SA.28.9	But the woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?”
1SA.28.10	Saul swore to her by the 
1SA.28.11	Then the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?”
1SA.28.11	“Bring up Samuel,” he said.
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”
1SA.28.13	The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid. What do you see?”
1SA.28.13	The woman said, “I see a ghostly figure
1SA.28.14	“What does he look like?” he asked.
1SA.28.14	“An old man wearing a robe is coming up,” she said.
1SA.28.14	Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.
1SA.28.15	Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?”
1SA.28.15	“I am in great distress,” Saul said. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.”
1SA.28.16	Samuel said, “Why do you consult me, now that the 
1SA.28.17	The 
1SA.28.18	Because you did not obey the 
1SA.28.19	The 
1SA.28.20	Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel’s words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and all that night.
1SA.28.21	When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, “Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do. 
1SA.28.22	Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.”
1SA.28.23	He refused and said, “I will not eat.”
1SA.28.23	But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch.
1SA.28.24	The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast. 
1SA.28.25	Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left.
1SA.29.1	The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish. 
1SA.29.3	The commanders of the Philistines asked, “What about these Hebrews?”
1SA.29.3	Achish replied, “Is this not David, who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found no fault in him.”
1SA.29.4	But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said, “Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his master’s favor than by taking the heads of our own men? 
1SA.29.5	Isn’t this the David they sang about in their dances:
1SA.29.5	“ ‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.29.5	and David his tens of thousands’?”
1SA.29.6	So Achish called David and said to him, “As surely as the 
1SA.29.7	Now turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers.”
1SA.29.8	“But what have I done?” asked David. “What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can’t I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”
1SA.29.9	Achish answered, “I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, ‘He must not go up with us into battle.’ 
1SA.29.10	Now get up early, along with your master’s servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light.”
1SA.29.11	So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it, 
1SA.30.2	and had taken captive the women and everyone else in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way.
1SA.30.3	When David and his men reached Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive. 
1SA.30.4	So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep. 
1SA.30.5	David’s two wives had been captured—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel. 
1SA.30.6	David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the 
1SA.30.7	Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelek, “Bring me the ephod.” Abiathar brought it to him, 
1SA.30.8	and David inquired of the 
1SA.30.8	“Pursue them,” he answered. “You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue.”
1SA.30.9	David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Valley, where some stayed behind. 
1SA.30.10	Two hundred of them were too exhausted to cross the valley, but David and the other four hundred continued the pursuit.
1SA.30.11	They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat— 
1SA.30.12	part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.
1SA.30.13	David asked him, “Who do you belong to? Where do you come from?”
1SA.30.13	He said, “I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago. 
1SA.30.14	We raided the Negev of the Kerethites, some territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag.”
1SA.30.15	David asked him, “Can you lead me down to this raiding party?”
1SA.30.15	He answered, “Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them.”
1SA.30.16	He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah. 
1SA.30.17	David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled. 
1SA.30.18	David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back. 
1SA.30.20	He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, “This is David’s plunder.”
1SA.30.21	Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Valley. They came out to meet David and the men with him. As David and his men approached, he asked them how they were. 
1SA.30.22	But all the evil men and troublemakers among David’s followers said, “Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go.”
1SA.30.23	David replied, “No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the 
1SA.30.24	Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike.” 
1SA.30.25	David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this.
1SA.30.26	When David reached Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the 
1SA.30.27	David sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and Jattir; 
1SA.30.28	to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa 
1SA.30.29	and Rakal; to those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites; 
1SA.30.30	to those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athak 
1SA.30.31	and Hebron; and to those in all the other places where he and his men had roamed.
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua. 
1SA.31.3	The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically.
1SA.31.4	Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me.”
1SA.31.4	But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it. 
1SA.31.5	When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together that same day.
1SA.31.7	When the Israelites along the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.
1SA.31.8	The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	They cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people. 
1SA.31.10	They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.
1SA.31.11	When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	all their valiant men marched through the night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them. 
1SA.31.13	Then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.
2SA.1.1	After the death of Saul, David returned from striking down the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days. 
2SA.1.2	On the third day a man arrived from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor.
2SA.1.3	“Where have you come from?” David asked him.
2SA.1.3	He answered, “I have escaped from the Israelite camp.”
2SA.1.4	“What happened?” David asked. “Tell me.”
2SA.1.4	“The men fled from the battle,” he replied. “Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”
2SA.1.5	Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
2SA.1.6	“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” the young man said, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and their drivers in hot pursuit. 
2SA.1.7	When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, ‘What can I do?’
2SA.1.8	“He asked me, ‘Who are you?’
2SA.1.8	“ ‘An Amalekite,’ I answered.
2SA.1.9	“Then he said to me, ‘Stand here by me and kill me! I’m in the throes of death, but I’m still alive.’
2SA.1.10	“So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.”
2SA.1.11	Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them. 
2SA.1.12	They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the 
2SA.1.13	David said to the young man who brought him the report, “Where are you from?”
2SA.1.13	“I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite,” he answered.
2SA.1.14	David asked him, “Why weren’t you afraid to lift your hand to destroy the 
2SA.1.15	Then David called one of his men and said, “Go, strike him down!” So he struck him down, and he died. 
2SA.1.16	For David had said to him, “Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, ‘I killed the 
2SA.1.17	David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan, 
2SA.1.18	and he ordered that the people of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar):
2SA.1.19	“A gazelle
2SA.1.19	How the mighty have fallen!
2SA.1.20	“Tell it not in Gath,
2SA.1.20	proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon,
2SA.1.20	lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad,
2SA.1.20	lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice.
2SA.1.21	“Mountains of Gilboa,
2SA.1.21	may you have neither dew nor rain,
2SA.1.21	may no showers fall on your terraced fields.
2SA.1.21	For there the shield of the mighty was despised,
2SA.1.21	the shield of Saul—no longer rubbed with oil.
2SA.1.22	“From the blood of the slain,
2SA.1.22	from the flesh of the mighty,
2SA.1.22	the bow of Jonathan did not turn back,
2SA.1.22	the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied.
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan—
2SA.1.23	in life they were loved and admired,
2SA.1.23	and in death they were not parted.
2SA.1.23	They were swifter than eagles,
2SA.1.23	they were stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	“Daughters of Israel,
2SA.1.24	weep for Saul,
2SA.1.24	who clothed you in scarlet and finery,
2SA.1.24	who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.
2SA.1.25	“How the mighty have fallen in battle!
2SA.1.25	Jonathan lies slain on your heights.
2SA.1.26	I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother;
2SA.1.26	you were very dear to me.
2SA.1.26	Your love for me was wonderful,
2SA.1.26	more wonderful than that of women.
2SA.1.27	“How the mighty have fallen!
2SA.1.27	The weapons of war have perished!”
2SA.2.1	In the course of time, David inquired of the 
2SA.2.1	The 
2SA.2.1	David asked, “Where shall I go?”
2SA.2.1	“To Hebron,” the 
2SA.2.2	So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel. 
2SA.2.3	David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns. 
2SA.2.4	Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they anointed David king over the tribe of Judah.
2SA.2.4	When David was told that it was the men from Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul, 
2SA.2.5	he sent messengers to them to say to them, “The 
2SA.2.6	May the 
2SA.2.7	Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the people of Judah have anointed me king over them.”
2SA.2.8	Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.9	He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.
2SA.2.10	Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The tribe of Judah, however, remained loyal to David. 
2SA.2.11	The length of time David was king in Hebron over Judah was seven years and six months.
2SA.2.12	Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	Joab son of Zeruiah and David’s men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.
2SA.2.14	Then Abner said to Joab, “Let’s have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us.”
2SA.2.14	“All right, let them do it,” Joab said.
2SA.2.15	So they stood up and were counted off—twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David. 
2SA.2.16	Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent’s side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.
2SA.2.17	The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the Israelites were defeated by David’s men.
2SA.2.18	The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle. 
2SA.2.19	He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him. 
2SA.2.20	Abner looked behind him and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?”
2SA.2.20	“It is,” he answered.
2SA.2.21	Then Abner said to him, “Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons.” But Asahel would not stop chasing him.
2SA.2.22	Again Abner warned Asahel, “Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?”
2SA.2.23	But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel’s stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon. 
2SA.2.25	Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.
2SA.2.26	Abner called out to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their fellow Israelites?”
2SA.2.27	Joab answered, “As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued pursuing them until morning.”
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the troops came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.
2SA.2.29	All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the morning hours
2SA.2.30	Then Joab stopped pursuing Abner and assembled the whole army. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David’s men were found missing. 
2SA.2.31	But David’s men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner. 
2SA.2.32	They took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.
2SA.3.1	The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
2SA.3.2	Sons were born to David in Hebron:
2SA.3.2	His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;
2SA.3.3	his second, Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel;
2SA.3.3	the third, Absalom the son of Maakah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
2SA.3.4	the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith;
2SA.3.4	the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
2SA.3.5	and the sixth, Ithream the son of David’s wife Eglah.
2SA.3.5	These were born to David in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul. 
2SA.3.7	Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, “Why did you sleep with my father’s concubine?”
2SA.3.8	Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said. So he answered, “Am I a dog’s head—on Judah’s side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven’t handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman! 
2SA.3.9	May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the 
2SA.3.10	and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David’s throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.” 
2SA.3.11	Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.
2SA.3.12	Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, “Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you.”
2SA.3.13	“Good,” said David. “I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me.” 
2SA.3.14	Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, “Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins.”
2SA.3.15	So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. 
2SA.3.16	Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go back home!” So he went back.
2SA.3.17	Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, “For some time you have wanted to make David your king. 
2SA.3.18	Now do it! For the 
2SA.3.19	Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole tribe of Benjamin wanted to do. 
2SA.3.20	When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men. 
2SA.3.21	Then Abner said to David, “Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
2SA.3.22	Just then David’s men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace.
2SA.3.24	So Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone! 
2SA.3.25	You know Abner son of Ner; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing.”
2SA.3.26	Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern at Sirah. But David did not know it. 
2SA.3.27	Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into an inner chamber, as if to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died.
2SA.3.28	Later, when David heard about this, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the 
2SA.3.29	May his blood fall on the head of Joab and on his whole family! May Joab’s family never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy
2SA.3.30	(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)
2SA.3.31	Then David said to Joab and all the people with him, “Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner.” King David himself walked behind the bier. 
2SA.3.32	They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner’s tomb. All the people wept also.
2SA.3.33	The king sang this lament for Abner:
2SA.3.33	“Should Abner have died as the lawless die?
2SA.3.34	Your hands were not bound,
2SA.3.34	your feet were not fettered.
2SA.3.34	You fell as one falls before the wicked.”
2SA.3.34	And all the people wept over him again.
2SA.3.35	Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!”
2SA.3.36	All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them. 
2SA.3.37	So on that day all the people there and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner.
2SA.3.38	Then the king said to his men, “Do you not realize that a commander and a great man has fallen in Israel this day? 
2SA.3.39	And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the 
2SA.4.1	When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel became alarmed. 
2SA.4.2	Now Saul’s son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Rekab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin—Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin, 
2SA.4.3	because the people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and have resided there as foreigners to this day.
2SA.4.4	(Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to leave, he fell and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.)
2SA.4.5	Now Rekab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for the house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest. 
2SA.4.6	They went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rekab and his brother Baanah slipped away.
2SA.4.7	They had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his bedroom. After they stabbed and killed him, they cut off his head. Taking it with them, they traveled all night by way of the Arabah. 
2SA.4.8	They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to kill you. This day the 
2SA.4.9	David answered Rekab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as the 
2SA.4.10	when someone told me, ‘Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news! 
2SA.4.11	How much more—when wicked men have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed—should I not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of you!”
2SA.4.12	So David gave an order to his men, and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-Bosheth and buried it in Abner’s tomb at Hebron.
2SA.5.1	All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “We are your own flesh and blood. 
2SA.5.2	In the past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the 
2SA.5.3	When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, the king made a covenant with them at Hebron before the 
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years. 
2SA.5.5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.
2SA.5.6	The king and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived there. The Jebusites said to David, “You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off.” They thought, “David cannot get in here.” 
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David.
2SA.5.8	On that day David had said, “Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those ‘lame and blind’ who are David’s enemies.
2SA.5.9	David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it, from the terraces
2SA.5.10	And he became more and more powerful, because the 
2SA.5.11	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David. 
2SA.5.12	Then David knew that the 
2SA.5.13	After he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him. 
2SA.5.14	These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold. 
2SA.5.18	Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim; 
2SA.5.19	so David inquired of the 
2SA.5.19	The 
2SA.5.20	So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, “As waters break out, the 
2SA.5.21	The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off.
2SA.5.22	Once more the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim; 
2SA.5.23	so David inquired of the 
2SA.5.24	As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the poplar trees, move quickly, because that will mean the 
2SA.5.25	So David did as the 
2SA.6.1	David again brought together all the able young men of Israel—thirty thousand. 
2SA.6.2	He and all his men went to Baalah
2SA.6.3	They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart 
2SA.6.4	with the ark of God on it,
2SA.6.5	David and all Israel were celebrating with all their might before the 
2SA.6.6	When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled. 
2SA.6.7	The 
2SA.6.8	Then David was angry because the 
2SA.6.9	David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	He was not willing to take the ark of the 
2SA.6.11	The ark of the 
2SA.6.12	Now King David was told, “The 
2SA.6.13	When those who were carrying the ark of the 
2SA.6.14	Wearing a linen ephod, David was dancing before the 
2SA.6.15	while he and all Israel were bringing up the ark of the 
2SA.6.16	As the ark of the 
2SA.6.17	They brought the ark of the 
2SA.6.18	After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes.
2SA.6.20	When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, “How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, going around half-naked in full view of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!”
2SA.6.21	David said to Michal, “It was before the 
2SA.6.22	I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor.”
2SA.6.23	And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.
2SA.7.1	After the king was settled in his palace and the 
2SA.7.2	he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent.”
2SA.7.3	Nathan replied to the king, “Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it, for the 
2SA.7.4	But that night the word of the 
2SA.7.5	“Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the 
2SA.7.6	I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling. 
2SA.7.7	Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?” ’
2SA.7.8	“Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the 
2SA.7.9	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men on earth. 
2SA.7.10	And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning 
2SA.7.11	and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders
2SA.7.11	“ ‘The 
2SA.7.12	When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, your own flesh and blood, and I will establish his kingdom. 
2SA.7.13	He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 
2SA.7.14	I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with a rod wielded by men, with floggings inflicted by human hands. 
2SA.7.15	But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 
2SA.7.16	Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me
2SA.7.17	Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.
2SA.7.18	Then King David went in and sat before the 
2SA.7.18	“Who am I, Sovereign 
2SA.7.19	And as if this were not enough in your sight, Sovereign 
2SA.7.20	“What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Sovereign 
2SA.7.21	For the sake of your word and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made it known to your servant.
2SA.7.22	“How great you are, Sovereign 
2SA.7.23	And who is like your people Israel—the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?
2SA.7.24	You have established your people Israel as your very own forever, and you, 
2SA.7.25	“And now, 
2SA.7.26	so that your name will be great forever. Then people will say, ‘The 
2SA.7.27	“
2SA.7.28	Sovereign 
2SA.7.29	Now be pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, Sovereign 
2SA.8.1	In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg Ammah from the control of the Philistines.
2SA.8.2	David also defeated the Moabites. He made them lie down on the ground and measured them off with a length of cord. Every two lengths of them were put to death, and the third length was allowed to live. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought him tribute.
2SA.8.3	Moreover, David defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to restore his monument at
2SA.8.4	David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers
2SA.8.5	When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of them. 
2SA.8.6	He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and brought tribute. The 
2SA.8.7	David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 
2SA.8.8	From Tebah
2SA.8.9	When Tou
2SA.8.10	he sent his son Joram
2SA.8.11	King David dedicated these articles to the 
2SA.8.12	Edom
2SA.8.13	And David became famous after he returned from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites
2SA.8.14	He put garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The 
2SA.8.15	David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people. 
2SA.8.16	Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder; 
2SA.8.17	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelek son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was secretary; 
2SA.8.18	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were priests.
2SA.9.1	David asked, “Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”
2SA.9.2	Now there was a servant of Saul’s household named Ziba. They summoned him to appear before David, and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?”
2SA.9.2	“At your service,” he replied.
2SA.9.3	The king asked, “Is there no one still alive from the house of Saul to whom I can show God’s kindness?”
2SA.9.3	Ziba answered the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan; he is lame in both feet.”
2SA.9.4	“Where is he?” the king asked.
2SA.9.4	Ziba answered, “He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.”
2SA.9.5	So King David had him brought from Lo Debar, from the house of Makir son of Ammiel.
2SA.9.6	When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed down to pay him honor.
2SA.9.6	David said, “Mephibosheth!”
2SA.9.6	“At your service,” he replied.
2SA.9.7	“Don’t be afraid,” David said to him, “for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.”
2SA.9.8	Mephibosheth bowed down and said, “What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?”
2SA.9.9	Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul’s steward, and said to him, “I have given your master’s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family. 
2SA.9.10	You and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops, so that your master’s grandson may be provided for. And Mephibosheth, grandson of your master, will always eat at my table.” (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.)
2SA.9.11	Then Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son named Mika, and all the members of Ziba’s household were servants of Mephibosheth. 
2SA.9.13	And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king’s table; he was lame in both feet.
2SA.10.1	In the course of time, the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun succeeded him as king. 
2SA.10.2	David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.
2SA.10.2	When David’s men came to the land of the Ammonites, 
2SA.10.3	the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Hasn’t David sent them to you only to explore the city and spy it out and overthrow it?” 
2SA.10.4	So Hanun seized David’s envoys, shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away.
2SA.10.5	When David was told about this, he sent messengers to meet the men, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back.”
2SA.10.6	When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious to David, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah, as well as the king of Maakah with a thousand men, and also twelve thousand men from Tob.
2SA.10.7	On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men. 
2SA.10.8	The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of their city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maakah were by themselves in the open country.
2SA.10.9	Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans. 
2SA.10.10	He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother and deployed them against the Ammonites. 
2SA.10.11	Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to come to my rescue; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to rescue you. 
2SA.10.12	Be strong, and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The 
2SA.10.13	Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
2SA.10.14	When the Ammonites realized that the Arameans were fleeing, they fled before Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they regrouped. 
2SA.10.16	Hadadezer had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River; they went to Helam, with Shobak the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.
2SA.10.17	When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan and went to Helam. The Arameans formed their battle lines to meet David and fought against him. 
2SA.10.18	But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers.
2SA.10.19	When all the kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace with the Israelites and became subject to them.
2SA.10.19	So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.
2SA.11.1	In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king’s men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.
2SA.11.2	One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful, 
2SA.11.3	and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, “She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” 
2SA.11.4	Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (Now she was purifying herself from her monthly uncleanness.) Then she went back home. 
2SA.11.5	The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.”
2SA.11.6	So David sent this word to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab sent him to David. 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going. 
2SA.11.8	Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him. 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master’s servants and did not go down to his house.
2SA.11.10	David was told, “Uriah did not go home.” So he asked Uriah, “Haven’t you just come from a military campaign? Why didn’t you go home?”
2SA.11.11	Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents,
2SA.11.12	Then David said to him, “Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
2SA.11.13	At David’s invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master’s servants; he did not go home.
2SA.11.14	In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. 
2SA.11.15	In it he wrote, “Put Uriah out in front where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die.”
2SA.11.16	So while Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were. 
2SA.11.17	When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of the men in David’s army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died.
2SA.11.18	Joab sent David a full account of the battle. 
2SA.11.19	He instructed the messenger: “When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle, 
2SA.11.20	the king’s anger may flare up, and he may ask you, ‘Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn’t you know they would shoot arrows from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	Who killed Abimelek son of Jerub-Besheth
2SA.11.22	The messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say. 
2SA.11.23	The messenger said to David, “The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate. 
2SA.11.24	Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king’s men died. Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.”
2SA.11.25	David told the messenger, “Say this to Joab: ‘Don’t let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.’ Say this to encourage Joab.”
2SA.11.26	When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. 
2SA.11.27	After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done displeased the 
2SA.12.1	The 
2SA.12.2	The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, 
2SA.12.3	but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.
2SA.12.4	“Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.”
2SA.12.5	David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, “As surely as the 
2SA.12.6	He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.”
2SA.12.7	Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! This is what the 
2SA.12.8	I gave your master’s house to you, and your master’s wives into your arms. I gave you all Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more. 
2SA.12.9	Why did you despise the word of the 
2SA.12.10	Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.’
2SA.12.11	“This is what the 
2SA.12.12	You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.’ ”
2SA.12.13	Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.13	Nathan replied, “The 
2SA.12.14	But because by doing this you have shown utter contempt for
2SA.12.15	After Nathan had gone home, the 
2SA.12.16	David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and spent the nights lying in sackcloth
2SA.12.17	The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them.
2SA.12.18	On the seventh day the child died. David’s attendants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, “While the child was still living, he wouldn’t listen to us when we spoke to him. How can we now tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate.”
2SA.12.19	David noticed that his attendants were whispering among themselves, and he realized the child was dead. “Is the child dead?” he asked.
2SA.12.19	“Yes,” they replied, “he is dead.”
2SA.12.20	Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the 
2SA.12.21	His attendants asked him, “Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!”
2SA.12.22	He answered, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, ‘Who knows? The 
2SA.12.23	But now that he is dead, why should I go on fasting? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”
2SA.12.24	Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and made love to her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The 
2SA.12.25	and because the 
2SA.12.26	Meanwhile Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel. 
2SA.12.27	Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, “I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply. 
2SA.12.28	Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will take the city, and it will be named after me.”
2SA.12.29	So David mustered the entire army and went to Rabbah, and attacked and captured it. 
2SA.12.30	David took the crown from their king’s
2SA.12.31	and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes, and he made them work at brickmaking.
2SA.13.1	In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.
2SA.13.2	Amnon became so obsessed with his sister Tamar that he made himself ill. She was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.
2SA.13.3	Now Amnon had an adviser named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man. 
2SA.13.4	He asked Amnon, “Why do you, the king’s son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?”
2SA.13.4	Amnon said to him, “I’m in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”
2SA.13.5	“Go to bed and pretend to be ill,” Jonadab said. “When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.’ ”
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, “I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand.”
2SA.13.7	David sent word to Tamar at the palace: “Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.” 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it. 
2SA.13.9	Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat.
2SA.13.9	“Send everyone out of here,” Amnon said. So everyone left him. 
2SA.13.10	Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom. 
2SA.13.11	But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me, my sister.”
2SA.13.12	“No, my brother!” she said to him. “Don’t force me! Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don’t do this wicked thing. 
2SA.13.13	What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you.” 
2SA.13.14	But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her.
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Get up and get out!”
2SA.13.16	“No!” she said to him. “Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.”
2SA.13.16	But he refused to listen to her. 
2SA.13.17	He called his personal servant and said, “Get this woman out of my sight and bolt the door after her.” 
2SA.13.18	So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing an ornate
2SA.13.19	Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornate robe she was wearing. She put her hands on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went.
2SA.13.20	Her brother Absalom said to her, “Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister; he is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.” And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom’s house, a desolate woman.
2SA.13.21	When King David heard all this, he was furious. 
2SA.13.22	And Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	Two years later, when Absalom’s sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king’s sons to come there. 
2SA.13.24	Absalom went to the king and said, “Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his attendants please join me?”
2SA.13.25	“No, my son,” the king replied. “All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you.” Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go but gave him his blessing.
2SA.13.26	Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us.”
2SA.13.26	The king asked him, “Why should he go with you?” 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king’s sons.
2SA.13.28	Absalom ordered his men, “Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon down,’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I given you this order? Be strong and brave.” 
2SA.13.29	So Absalom’s men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king’s sons got up, mounted their mules and fled.
2SA.13.30	While they were on their way, the report came to David: “Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons; not one of them is left.” 
2SA.13.31	The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his attendants stood by with their clothes torn.
2SA.13.32	But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother, said, “My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom’s express intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.33	My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king’s sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.”
2SA.13.34	Meanwhile, Absalom had fled.
2SA.13.34	Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, “I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill.”
2SA.13.35	Jonadab said to the king, “See, the king’s sons have come; it has happened just as your servant said.”
2SA.13.36	As he finished speaking, the king’s sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his attendants wept very bitterly.
2SA.13.37	Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned many days for his son.
2SA.13.38	After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years. 
2SA.13.39	And King David longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon’s death.
2SA.14.1	Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the king’s heart longed for Absalom. 
2SA.14.2	So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said to her, “Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes, and don’t use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead. 
2SA.14.3	Then go to the king and speak these words to him.” And Joab put the words in her mouth.
2SA.14.4	When the woman from Tekoa went
2SA.14.5	The king asked her, “What is troubling you?”
2SA.14.5	She said, “I am a widow; my husband is dead. 
2SA.14.6	I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him. 
2SA.14.7	Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir as well.’ They would put out the only burning coal I have left, leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth.”
2SA.14.8	The king said to the woman, “Go home, and I will issue an order in your behalf.”
2SA.14.9	But the woman from Tekoa said to him, “Let my lord the king pardon me and my family, and let the king and his throne be without guilt.”
2SA.14.10	The king replied, “If anyone says anything to you, bring them to me, and they will not bother you again.”
2SA.14.11	She said, “Then let the king invoke the 
2SA.14.11	“As surely as the 
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, “Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.”
2SA.14.12	“Speak,” he replied.
2SA.14.13	The woman said, “Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, for the king has not brought back his banished son? 
2SA.14.14	Like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die. But that is not what God desires; rather, he devises ways so that a banished person does not remain banished from him.
2SA.14.15	“And now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king; perhaps he will grant his servant’s request. 
2SA.14.16	Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from God’s inheritance.’
2SA.14.17	“And now your servant says, ‘May the word of my lord the king secure my inheritance, for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil. May the 
2SA.14.18	Then the king said to the woman, “Don’t keep from me the answer to what I am going to ask you.”
2SA.14.18	“Let my lord the king speak,” the woman said.
2SA.14.19	The king asked, “Isn’t the hand of Joab with you in all this?”
2SA.14.19	The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant. 
2SA.14.20	Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God—he knows everything that happens in the land.”
2SA.14.21	The king said to Joab, “Very well, I will do it. Go, bring back the young man Absalom.”
2SA.14.22	Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor, and he blessed the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant’s request.”
2SA.14.23	Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	But the king said, “He must go to his own house; he must not see my face.” So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king.
2SA.14.25	In all Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him. 
2SA.14.26	Whenever he cut the hair of his head—he used to cut his hair once a year because it became too heavy for him—he would weigh it, and its weight was two hundred shekels
2SA.14.27	Three sons and a daughter were born to Absalom. His daughter’s name was Tamar, and she became a beautiful woman.
2SA.14.28	Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king’s face. 
2SA.14.29	Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. So he sent a second time, but he refused to come. 
2SA.14.30	Then he said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
2SA.14.31	Then Joab did go to Absalom’s house, and he said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”
2SA.14.32	Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I sent word to you and said, ‘Come here so I can send you to the king to ask, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there!” ’ Now then, I want to see the king’s face, and if I am guilty of anything, let him put me to death.”
2SA.14.33	So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned Absalom, and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	In the course of time, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him. 
2SA.15.2	He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, “What town are you from?” He would answer, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.” 
2SA.15.3	Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you.” 
2SA.15.4	And Absalom would add, “If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that they receive justice.”
2SA.15.5	Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him. 
2SA.15.6	Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the people of Israel.
2SA.15.7	At the end of four
2SA.15.8	While your servant was living at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow: ‘If the 
2SA.15.9	The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he went to Hebron.
2SA.15.10	Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’ ” 
2SA.15.11	Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter. 
2SA.15.12	While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept on increasing.
2SA.15.13	A messenger came and told David, “The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom.”
2SA.15.14	Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, “Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin on us and put the city to the sword.”
2SA.15.15	The king’s officials answered him, “Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses.”
2SA.15.16	The king set out, with his entire household following him; but he left ten concubines to take care of the palace. 
2SA.15.17	So the king set out, with all the people following him, and they halted at the edge of the city. 
2SA.15.18	All his men marched past him, along with all the Kerethites and Pelethites; and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath marched before the king.
2SA.15.19	The king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland. 
2SA.15.20	You came only yesterday. And today shall I make you wander about with us, when I do not know where I am going? Go back, and take your people with you. May the 
2SA.15.21	But Ittai replied to the king, “As surely as the 
2SA.15.22	David said to Ittai, “Go ahead, march on.” So Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him.
2SA.15.23	The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	Zadok was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city.
2SA.15.25	Then the king said to Zadok, “Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the 
2SA.15.26	But if he says, ‘I am not pleased with you,’ then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him.”
2SA.15.27	The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Do you understand? Go back to the city with my blessing. Take your son Ahimaaz with you, and also Abiathar’s son Jonathan. You and Abiathar return with your two sons. 
2SA.15.28	I will wait at the fords in the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.” 
2SA.15.29	So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.
2SA.15.30	But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went; his head was covered and he was barefoot. All the people with him covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up. 
2SA.15.31	Now David had been told, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” So David prayed, “
2SA.15.32	When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head. 
2SA.15.33	David said to him, “If you go with me, you will be a burden to me. 
2SA.15.34	But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘Your Majesty, I will be your servant; I was your father’s servant in the past, but now I will be your servant,’ then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel’s advice. 
2SA.15.35	Won’t the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Tell them anything you hear in the king’s palace. 
2SA.15.36	Their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with anything you hear.”
2SA.15.37	So Hushai, David’s confidant, arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city.
2SA.16.1	When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, there was Ziba, the steward of Mephibosheth, waiting to meet him. He had a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of wine.
2SA.16.2	The king asked Ziba, “Why have you brought these?”
2SA.16.2	Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”
2SA.16.3	The king then asked, “Where is your master’s grandson?”
2SA.16.3	Ziba said to him, “He is staying in Jerusalem, because he thinks, ‘Today the Israelites will restore to me my grandfather’s kingdom.’ ”
2SA.16.4	Then the king said to Ziba, “All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.”
2SA.16.4	“I humbly bow,” Ziba said. “May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.”
2SA.16.5	As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul’s family came out from there. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and he cursed as he came out. 
2SA.16.6	He pelted David and all the king’s officials with stones, though all the troops and the special guard were on David’s right and left. 
2SA.16.7	As he cursed, Shimei said, “Get out, get out, you murderer, you scoundrel! 
2SA.16.8	The 
2SA.16.9	Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head.”
2SA.16.10	But the king said, “What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the 
2SA.16.11	David then said to Abishai and all his officials, “My son, my own flesh and blood, is trying to kill me. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the 
2SA.16.12	It may be that the 
2SA.16.13	So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt. 
2SA.16.14	The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.
2SA.16.15	Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. 
2SA.16.16	Then Hushai the Arkite, David’s confidant, went to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
2SA.16.17	Absalom said to Hushai, “So this is the love you show your friend? If he’s your friend, why didn’t you go with him?”
2SA.16.18	Hushai said to Absalom, “No, the one chosen by the 
2SA.16.19	Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve the son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.”
2SA.16.20	Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give us your advice. What should we do?”
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel answered, “Sleep with your father’s concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself obnoxious to your father, and the hands of everyone with you will be more resolute.” 
2SA.16.22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
2SA.16.23	Now in those days the advice Ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of God. That was how both David and Absalom regarded all of Ahithophel’s advice.
2SA.17.1	Ahithophel said to Absalom, “I would
2SA.17.2	I would attack him while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror, and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king 
2SA.17.3	and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all; all the people will be unharmed.” 
2SA.17.4	This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.
2SA.17.5	But Absalom said, “Summon also Hushai the Arkite, so we can hear what he has to say as well.” 
2SA.17.6	When Hushai came to him, Absalom said, “Ahithophel has given this advice. Should we do what he says? If not, give us your opinion.”
2SA.17.7	Hushai replied to Absalom, “The advice Ahithophel has given is not good this time. 
2SA.17.8	You know your father and his men; they are fighters, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Besides, your father is an experienced fighter; he will not spend the night with the troops. 
2SA.17.9	Even now, he is hidden in a cave or some other place. If he should attack your troops first,
2SA.17.10	Then even the bravest soldier, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave.
2SA.17.11	“So I advise you: Let all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba—as numerous as the sand on the seashore—be gathered to you, with you yourself leading them into battle. 
2SA.17.12	Then we will attack him wherever he may be found, and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive. 
2SA.17.13	If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not so much as a pebble is left.”
2SA.17.14	Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel.” For the 
2SA.17.15	Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, “Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such, but I have advised them to do so and so. 
2SA.17.16	Now send a message at once and tell David, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords in the wilderness; cross over without fail, or the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.’ ”
2SA.17.17	Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel. A female servant was to go and inform them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they could not risk being seen entering the city. 
2SA.17.18	But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them left at once and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it. 
2SA.17.19	His wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it. No one knew anything about it.
2SA.17.20	When Absalom’s men came to the woman at the house, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
2SA.17.20	The woman answered them, “They crossed over the brook.”
2SA.17.21	After they had gone, the two climbed out of the well and went to inform King David. They said to him, “Set out and cross the river at once; Ahithophel has advised such and such against you.” 
2SA.17.22	So David and all the people with him set out and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, no one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.
2SA.17.23	When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his house in order and then hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father’s tomb.
2SA.17.24	David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. 
2SA.17.25	Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of Jether,
2SA.17.26	The Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Makir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim 
2SA.17.28	brought bedding and bowls and articles of pottery. They also brought wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans and lentils,
2SA.17.29	honey and curds, sheep, and cheese from cows’ milk for David and his people to eat. For they said, “The people have become exhausted and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness.”
2SA.18.1	David mustered the men who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 
2SA.18.2	David sent out his troops, a third under the command of Joab, a third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops, “I myself will surely march out with you.”
2SA.18.3	But the men said, “You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won’t care about us. Even if half of us die, they won’t care; but you are worth ten thousand of us.
2SA.18.4	The king answered, “I will do whatever seems best to you.”
2SA.18.4	So the king stood beside the gate while all his men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands. 
2SA.18.5	The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, “Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake.” And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders.
2SA.18.6	David’s army marched out of the city to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	There Israel’s troops were routed by David’s men, and the casualties that day were great—twenty thousand men. 
2SA.18.8	The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest swallowed up more men that day than the sword.
2SA.18.9	Now Absalom happened to meet David’s men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom’s hair got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.
2SA.18.10	When one of the men saw what had happened, he told Joab, “I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.”
2SA.18.11	Joab said to the man who had told him this, “What! You saw him? Why didn’t you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels
2SA.18.12	But the man replied, “Even if a thousand shekels
2SA.18.13	And if I had put my life in jeopardy
2SA.18.14	Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this for you.” So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom’s heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree. 
2SA.18.15	And ten of Joab’s armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him.
2SA.18.16	Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them. 
2SA.18.17	They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes.
2SA.18.18	During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King’s Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, “I have no son to carry on the memory of my name.” He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom’s Monument to this day.
2SA.18.19	Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Let me run and take the news to the king that the 
2SA.18.20	“You are not the one to take the news today,” Joab told him. “You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king’s son is dead.”
2SA.18.21	Then Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off.
2SA.18.22	Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, “Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite.”
2SA.18.22	But Joab replied, “My son, why do you want to go? You don’t have any news that will bring you a reward.”
2SA.18.23	He said, “Come what may, I want to run.”
2SA.18.23	So Joab said, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain
2SA.18.24	While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone. 
2SA.18.25	The watchman called out to the king and reported it.
2SA.18.25	The king said, “If he is alone, he must have good news.” And the runner came closer and closer.
2SA.18.26	Then the watchman saw another runner, and he called down to the gatekeeper, “Look, another man running alone!”
2SA.18.26	The king said, “He must be bringing good news, too.”
2SA.18.27	The watchman said, “It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.”
2SA.18.27	“He’s a good man,” the king said. “He comes with good news.”
2SA.18.28	Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All is well!” He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Praise be to the 
2SA.18.29	The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom safe?”
2SA.18.29	Ahimaaz answered, “I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king’s servant and me, your servant, but I don’t know what it was.”
2SA.18.30	The king said, “Stand aside and wait here.” So he stepped aside and stood there.
2SA.18.31	Then the Cushite arrived and said, “My lord the king, hear the good news! The 
2SA.18.32	The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom safe?”
2SA.18.32	The Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man.”
2SA.18.33	The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you—O Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.1	Joab was told, “The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.” 
2SA.19.2	And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, “The king is grieving for his son.” 
2SA.19.3	The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle. 
2SA.19.4	The king covered his face and cried aloud, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.5	Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, “Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines. 
2SA.19.6	You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you. I see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead. 
2SA.19.7	Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told, “The king is sitting in the gateway,” they all came before him.
2SA.19.8	Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled to their homes.
2SA.19.9	Throughout the tribes of Israel, all the people were arguing among themselves, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies; he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. But now he has fled the country to escape from Absalom; 
2SA.19.10	and Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?”
2SA.19.11	King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: “Ask the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters? 
2SA.19.12	You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?’ 
2SA.19.13	And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you are not the commander of my army for life in place of Joab.’ ”
2SA.19.14	He won over the hearts of the men of Judah so that they were all of one mind. They sent word to the king, “Return, you and all your men.” 
2SA.19.15	Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan.
2SA.19.15	Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan. 
2SA.19.16	Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David. 
2SA.19.17	With him were a thousand Benjamites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul’s household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan, where the king was. 
2SA.19.18	They crossed at the ford to take the king’s household over and to do whatever he wished.
2SA.19.18	When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king 
2SA.19.19	and said to him, “May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind. 
2SA.19.20	For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first from the tribes of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king.”
2SA.19.21	Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the 
2SA.19.22	David replied, “What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? What right do you have to interfere? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don’t I know that today I am king over Israel?” 
2SA.19.23	So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king promised him on oath.
2SA.19.24	Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely. 
2SA.19.25	When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”
2SA.19.26	He said, “My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, ‘I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.’ But Ziba my servant betrayed me. 
2SA.19.27	And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever you wish. 
2SA.19.28	All my grandfather’s descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?”
2SA.19.29	The king said to him, “Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the land.”
2SA.19.30	Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has returned home safely.”
2SA.19.31	Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there. 
2SA.19.32	Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. 
2SA.19.33	The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you.”
2SA.19.34	But Barzillai answered the king, “How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? 
2SA.19.35	I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is enjoyable and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? 
2SA.19.36	Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way? 
2SA.19.37	Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever you wish.”
2SA.19.38	The king said, “Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever you wish. And anything you desire from me I will do for you.”
2SA.19.39	So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and bid him farewell, and Barzillai returned to his home.
2SA.19.40	When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over.
2SA.19.41	Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?”
2SA.19.42	All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king’s provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?”
2SA.19.43	Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have ten shares in the king; so we have a greater claim on David than you have. Why then do you treat us with contempt? Weren’t we the first to speak of bringing back our king?”
2SA.19.43	But the men of Judah pressed their claims even more forcefully than the men of Israel.
2SA.20.1	Now a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bikri, a Benjamite, happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and shouted,
2SA.20.1	“We have no share in David,
2SA.20.1	no part in Jesse’s son!
2SA.20.1	Every man to his tent, Israel!”
2SA.20.2	So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bikri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
2SA.20.3	When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them but had no sexual relations with them. They were kept in confinement till the day of their death, living as widows.
2SA.20.4	Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself.” 
2SA.20.5	But when Amasa went to summon Judah, he took longer than the time the king had set for him.
2SA.20.6	David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba son of Bikri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your master’s men and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and escape from us.”
2SA.20.7	So Joab’s men and the Kerethites and Pelethites and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of Abishai. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bikri.
2SA.20.8	While they were at the great rock in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military tunic, and strapped over it at his waist was a belt with a dagger in its sheath. As he stepped forward, it dropped out of its sheath.
2SA.20.9	Joab said to Amasa, “How are you, my brother?” Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	Amasa was not on his guard against the dagger in Joab’s hand, and Joab plunged it into his belly, and his intestines spilled out on the ground. Without being stabbed again, Amasa died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bikri.
2SA.20.11	One of Joab’s men stood beside Amasa and said, “Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!” 
2SA.20.12	Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the troops came to a halt there. When he realized that everyone who came up to Amasa stopped, he dragged him from the road into a field and threw a garment over him. 
2SA.20.13	After Amasa had been removed from the road, everyone went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bikri.
2SA.20.14	Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maakah and through the entire region of the Bikrites,
2SA.20.15	All the troops with Joab came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maakah. They built a siege ramp up to the city, and it stood against the outer fortifications. While they were battering the wall to bring it down, 
2SA.20.16	a wise woman called from the city, “Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here so I can speak to him.” 
2SA.20.17	He went toward her, and she asked, “Are you Joab?”
2SA.20.17	“I am,” he answered.
2SA.20.17	She said, “Listen to what your servant has to say.”
2SA.20.17	“I’m listening,” he said.
2SA.20.18	She continued, “Long ago they used to say, ‘Get your answer at Abel,’ and that settled it. 
2SA.20.19	We are the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow up the 
2SA.20.20	“Far be it from me!” Joab replied, “Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy! 
2SA.20.21	That is not the case. A man named Sheba son of Bikri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Hand over this one man, and I’ll withdraw from the city.”
2SA.20.21	The woman said to Joab, “His head will be thrown to you from the wall.”
2SA.20.22	Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bikri and threw it to Joab. So he sounded the trumpet, and his men dispersed from the city, each returning to his home. And Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem.
2SA.20.23	Joab was over Israel’s entire army; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; 
2SA.20.24	Adoniram
2SA.20.25	Sheva was secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
2SA.20.26	and Ira the Jairite
2SA.21.1	During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the 
2SA.21.2	The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.) 
2SA.21.3	David asked the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? How shall I make atonement so that you will bless the 
2SA.21.4	The Gibeonites answered him, “We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death.”
2SA.21.4	“What do you want me to do for you?” David asked.
2SA.21.5	They answered the king, “As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel, 
2SA.21.6	let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and their bodies exposed before the 
2SA.21.6	So the king said, “I will give them to you.”
2SA.21.7	The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the 
2SA.21.8	But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah’s daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab,
2SA.21.9	He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed them and exposed their bodies on a hill before the 
2SA.21.10	Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies, she did not let the birds touch them by day or the wild animals by night. 
2SA.21.11	When David was told what Aiah’s daughter Rizpah, Saul’s concubine, had done, 
2SA.21.12	he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. (They had stolen their bodies from the public square at Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they struck Saul down on Gilboa.) 
2SA.21.13	David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up.
2SA.21.14	They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did everything the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land.
2SA.21.15	Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines, and he became exhausted. 
2SA.21.16	And Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha, whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels
2SA.21.17	But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David’s rescue; he struck the Philistine down and killed him. Then David’s men swore to him, saying, “Never again will you go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel will not be extinguished.”
2SA.21.18	In the course of time, there was another battle with the Philistines, at Gob. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha.
2SA.21.19	In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jair
2SA.21.20	In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha. 
2SA.21.21	When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David’s brother, killed him.
2SA.21.22	These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.
2SA.22.1	David sang to the 
2SA.22.2	He said:
2SA.22.2	“The 
2SA.22.3	my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,
2SA.22.3	my shield
2SA.22.3	He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior—
2SA.22.3	from violent people you save me.
2SA.22.4	“I called to the 
2SA.22.4	and have been saved from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	The waves of death swirled about me;
2SA.22.5	the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
2SA.22.6	The cords of the grave coiled around me;
2SA.22.6	the snares of death confronted me.
2SA.22.7	“In my distress I called to the 
2SA.22.7	I called out to my God.
2SA.22.7	From his temple he heard my voice;
2SA.22.7	my cry came to his ears.
2SA.22.8	The earth trembled and quaked,
2SA.22.8	the foundations of the heavens
2SA.22.8	they trembled because he was angry.
2SA.22.9	Smoke rose from his nostrils;
2SA.22.9	consuming fire came from his mouth,
2SA.22.9	burning coals blazed out of it.
2SA.22.10	He parted the heavens and came down;
2SA.22.10	dark clouds were under his feet.
2SA.22.11	He mounted the cherubim and flew;
2SA.22.11	he soared
2SA.22.12	He made darkness his canopy around him—
2SA.22.12	the dark
2SA.22.13	Out of the brightness of his presence
2SA.22.13	bolts of lightning blazed forth.
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.14	the voice of the Most High resounded.
2SA.22.15	He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy,
2SA.22.15	with great bolts of lightning he routed them.
2SA.22.16	The valleys of the sea were exposed
2SA.22.16	and the foundations of the earth laid bare
2SA.22.16	at the rebuke of the 
2SA.22.16	at the blast of breath from his nostrils.
2SA.22.17	“He reached down from on high and took hold of me;
2SA.22.17	he drew me out of deep waters.
2SA.22.18	He rescued me from my powerful enemy,
2SA.22.18	from my foes, who were too strong for me.
2SA.22.19	They confronted me in the day of my disaster,
2SA.22.19	but the 
2SA.22.20	He brought me out into a spacious place;
2SA.22.20	he rescued me because he delighted in me.
2SA.22.21	“The 
2SA.22.21	according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the 
2SA.22.22	I am not guilty of turning from my God.
2SA.22.23	All his laws are before me;
2SA.22.23	I have not turned away from his decrees.
2SA.22.24	I have been blameless before him
2SA.22.24	and have kept myself from sin.
2SA.22.25	The 
2SA.22.25	according to my cleanness
2SA.22.26	“To the faithful you show yourself faithful,
2SA.22.26	to the blameless you show yourself blameless,
2SA.22.27	to the pure you show yourself pure,
2SA.22.27	but to the devious you show yourself shrewd.
2SA.22.28	You save the humble,
2SA.22.28	but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.
2SA.22.29	You, 
2SA.22.29	the 
2SA.22.30	With your help I can advance against a troop
2SA.22.30	with my God I can scale a wall.
2SA.22.31	“As for God, his way is perfect:
2SA.22.31	The 
2SA.22.31	he shields all who take refuge in him.
2SA.22.32	For who is God besides the 
2SA.22.32	And who is the Rock except our God?
2SA.22.33	It is God who arms me with strength
2SA.22.33	and keeps my way secure.
2SA.22.34	He makes my feet like the feet of a deer;
2SA.22.34	he causes me to stand on the heights.
2SA.22.35	He trains my hands for battle;
2SA.22.35	my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
2SA.22.36	You make your saving help my shield;
2SA.22.36	your help has made
2SA.22.37	You provide a broad path for my feet,
2SA.22.37	so that my ankles do not give way.
2SA.22.38	“I pursued my enemies and crushed them;
2SA.22.38	I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
2SA.22.39	I crushed them completely, and they could not rise;
2SA.22.39	they fell beneath my feet.
2SA.22.40	You armed me with strength for battle;
2SA.22.40	you humbled my adversaries before me.
2SA.22.41	You made my enemies turn their backs in flight,
2SA.22.41	and I destroyed my foes.
2SA.22.42	They cried for help, but there was no one to save them—
2SA.22.42	to the 
2SA.22.43	I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth;
2SA.22.43	I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets.
2SA.22.44	“You have delivered me from the attacks of the peoples;
2SA.22.44	you have preserved me as the head of nations.
2SA.22.44	People I did not know now serve me,
2SA.22.45	foreigners cower before me;
2SA.22.45	as soon as they hear of me, they obey me.
2SA.22.46	They all lose heart;
2SA.22.46	they come trembling
2SA.22.47	“The 
2SA.22.47	Exalted be my God, the Rock, my Savior!
2SA.22.48	He is the God who avenges me,
2SA.22.48	who puts the nations under me,
2SA.22.49	who sets me free from my enemies.
2SA.22.49	You exalted me above my foes;
2SA.22.49	from a violent man you rescued me.
2SA.22.50	Therefore I will praise you, 
2SA.22.50	I will sing the praises of your name.
2SA.22.51	“He gives his king great victories;
2SA.22.51	he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed,
2SA.22.51	to David and his descendants forever.”
2SA.23.1	These are the last words of David:
2SA.23.1	“The inspired utterance of David son of Jesse,
2SA.23.1	the utterance of the man exalted by the Most High,
2SA.23.1	the man anointed by the God of Jacob,
2SA.23.1	the hero of Israel’s songs:
2SA.23.2	“The Spirit of the 
2SA.23.2	his word was on my tongue.
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel spoke,
2SA.23.3	the Rock of Israel said to me:
2SA.23.3	‘When one rules over people in righteousness,
2SA.23.3	when he rules in the fear of God,
2SA.23.4	he is like the light of morning at sunrise
2SA.23.4	on a cloudless morning,
2SA.23.4	like the brightness after rain
2SA.23.4	that brings grass from the earth.’
2SA.23.5	“If my house were not right with God,
2SA.23.5	surely he would not have made with me an everlasting covenant,
2SA.23.5	arranged and secured in every part;
2SA.23.5	surely he would not bring to fruition my salvation
2SA.23.5	and grant me my every desire.
2SA.23.6	But evil men are all to be cast aside like thorns,
2SA.23.6	which are not gathered with the hand.
2SA.23.7	Whoever touches thorns
2SA.23.7	uses a tool of iron or the shaft of a spear;
2SA.23.7	they are burned up where they lie.”
2SA.23.8	These are the names of David’s mighty warriors:
2SA.23.8	Josheb-Basshebeth,
2SA.23.9	Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty warriors, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim
2SA.23.10	but Eleazar stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The 
2SA.23.11	Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel’s troops fled from them. 
2SA.23.12	But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the 
2SA.23.13	During harvest time, three of the thirty chief warriors came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.23.14	At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. 
2SA.23.15	David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” 
2SA.23.16	So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the 
2SA.23.17	“Far be it from me, 
2SA.23.17	Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors.
2SA.23.18	Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three.
2SA.23.19	Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them.
2SA.23.20	Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. 
2SA.23.21	And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. 
2SA.23.22	Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors. 
2SA.23.23	He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
2SA.23.24	Among the Thirty were:
2SA.23.24	Asahel the brother of Joab,
2SA.23.24	Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,
2SA.23.25	Shammah the Harodite,
2SA.23.25	Elika the Harodite,
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite,
2SA.23.26	Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,
2SA.23.27	Abiezer from Anathoth,
2SA.23.27	Sibbekai
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite,
2SA.23.28	Maharai the Netophathite,
2SA.23.29	Heled
2SA.23.29	Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin,
2SA.23.30	Benaiah the Pirathonite,
2SA.23.30	Hiddai
2SA.23.31	Abi-Albon the Arbathite,
2SA.23.31	Azmaveth the Barhumite,
2SA.23.32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
2SA.23.32	the sons of Jashen,
2SA.23.32	Jonathan 
2SA.23.33	son of
2SA.23.33	Ahiam son of Sharar
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maakathite,
2SA.23.34	Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
2SA.23.35	Hezro the Carmelite,
2SA.23.35	Paarai the Arbite,
2SA.23.36	Igal son of Nathan from Zobah,
2SA.23.36	the son of Hagri,
2SA.23.37	Zelek the Ammonite,
2SA.23.37	Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
2SA.23.38	Ira the Ithrite,
2SA.23.38	Gareb the Ithrite
2SA.23.39	and Uriah the Hittite.
2SA.23.39	There were thirty-seven in all.
2SA.24.1	Again the anger of the 
2SA.24.2	So the king said to Joab and the army commanders
2SA.24.3	But Joab replied to the king, “May the 
2SA.24.4	The king’s word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel.
2SA.24.5	After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer. 
2SA.24.6	They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon. 
2SA.24.7	Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah.
2SA.24.8	After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
2SA.24.9	Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand.
2SA.24.10	David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the 
2SA.24.11	Before David got up the next morning, the word of the 
2SA.24.12	“Go and tell David, ‘This is what the 
2SA.24.13	So Gad went to David and said to him, “Shall there come on you three
2SA.24.14	David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the 
2SA.24.15	So the 
2SA.24.16	When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the 
2SA.24.17	When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the 
2SA.24.18	On that day Gad went to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar to the 
2SA.24.19	So David went up, as the 
2SA.24.20	When Araunah looked and saw the king and his officials coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.
2SA.24.21	Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”
2SA.24.21	“To buy your threshing floor,” David answered, “so I can build an altar to the 
2SA.24.22	Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take whatever he wishes and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood. 
2SA.24.23	Your Majesty, Araunah
2SA.24.24	But the king replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the 
2SA.24.24	So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels
2SA.24.25	David built an altar to the 
1KI.1.1	When King David was very old, he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him. 
1KI.1.2	So his attendants said to him, “Let us look for a young virgin to serve the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm.”
1KI.1.3	Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	The woman was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no sexual relations with her.
1KI.1.5	Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, “I will be king.” So he got chariots and horses
1KI.1.6	(His father had never rebuked him by asking, “Why do you behave as you do?” He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.)
1KI.1.7	Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support. 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei and David’s special guard did not join Adonijah.
1KI.1.9	Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the royal officials of Judah, 
1KI.1.10	but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon.
1KI.1.11	Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king, and our lord David knows nothing about it? 
1KI.1.12	Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. 
1KI.1.13	Go in to King David and say to him, ‘My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: “Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’ 
1KI.1.14	While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and add my word to what you have said.”
1KI.1.15	So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him. 
1KI.1.16	Bathsheba bowed down, prostrating herself before the king.
1KI.1.16	“What is it you want?” the king asked.
1KI.1.17	She said to him, “My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the 
1KI.1.18	But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it. 
1KI.1.19	He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king’s sons, Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant. 
1KI.1.20	My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
1KI.1.21	Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his ancestors, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals.”
1KI.1.22	While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. 
1KI.1.23	And the king was told, “Nathan the prophet is here.” So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.
1KI.1.24	Nathan said, “Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne? 
1KI.1.25	Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king’s sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ 
1KI.1.26	But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite. 
1KI.1.27	Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”
1KI.1.28	Then King David said, “Call in Bathsheba.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before him.
1KI.1.29	The king then took an oath: “As surely as the 
1KI.1.30	I will surely carry out this very day what I swore to you by the 
1KI.1.31	Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground, prostrating herself before the king, and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”
1KI.1.32	King David said, “Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” When they came before the king, 
1KI.1.33	he said to them: “Take your lord’s servants with you and have Solomon my son mount my own mule and take him down to Gihon. 
1KI.1.34	There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 
1KI.1.35	Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.”
1KI.1.36	Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, “Amen! May the 
1KI.1.37	As the 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon mount King David’s mule, and they escorted him to Gihon. 
1KI.1.39	Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, “Long live King Solomon!” 
1KI.1.40	And all the people went up after him, playing pipes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound.
1KI.1.41	Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, “What’s the meaning of all the noise in the city?”
1KI.1.42	Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, “Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.”
1KI.1.43	“Not at all!” Jonathan answered. “Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 
1KI.1.44	The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king’s mule, 
1KI.1.45	and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That’s the noise you hear. 
1KI.1.46	Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne. 
1KI.1.47	Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make Solomon’s name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!’ And the king bowed in worship on his bed 
1KI.1.48	and said, ‘Praise be to the 
1KI.1.49	At this, all Adonijah’s guests rose in alarm and dispersed. 
1KI.1.50	But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar. 
1KI.1.51	Then Solomon was told, “Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’ ”
1KI.1.52	Solomon replied, “If he shows himself to be worthy, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die.” 
1KI.1.53	Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, “Go to your home.”
1KI.2.1	When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son.
1KI.2.2	“I am about to go the way of all the earth,” he said. “So be strong, act like a man, 
1KI.2.3	and observe what the 
1KI.2.4	and that the 
1KI.2.5	“Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to the two commanders of Israel’s armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood he stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. 
1KI.2.6	Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.
1KI.2.7	“But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
1KI.2.8	“And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the 
1KI.2.9	But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood.”
1KI.2.10	Then David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. 
1KI.2.11	He had reigned forty years over Israel—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. 
1KI.2.12	So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established.
1KI.2.13	Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. Bathsheba asked him, “Do you come peacefully?”
1KI.2.13	He answered, “Yes, peacefully.” 
1KI.2.14	Then he added, “I have something to say to you.”
1KI.2.14	“You may say it,” she replied.
1KI.2.15	“As you know,” he said, “the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the 
1KI.2.16	Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me.”
1KI.2.16	“You may make it,” she said.
1KI.2.17	So he continued, “Please ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.”
1KI.2.18	“Very well,” Bathsheba replied, “I will speak to the king for you.”
1KI.2.19	When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king’s mother, and she sat down at his right hand.
1KI.2.20	“I have one small request to make of you,” she said. “Do not refuse me.”
1KI.2.20	The king replied, “Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you.”
1KI.2.21	So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah.”
1KI.2.22	King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him—after all, he is my older brother—yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!”
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon swore by the 
1KI.2.24	And now, as surely as the 
1KI.2.25	So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died.
1KI.2.26	To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign 
1KI.2.27	So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the 
1KI.2.28	When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the 
1KI.2.29	King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the 
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah entered the tent of the 
1KI.2.30	But he answered, “No, I will die here.”
1KI.2.30	Benaiah reported to the king, “This is how Joab answered me.”
1KI.2.31	Then the king commanded Benaiah, “Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my whole family of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed. 
1KI.2.32	The 
1KI.2.33	May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the 
1KI.2.34	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried at his home out in the country. 
1KI.2.35	The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab’s position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.
1KI.2.36	Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else. 
1KI.2.37	The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head.”
1KI.2.38	Shimei answered the king, “What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said.” And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.
1KI.2.39	But three years later, two of Shimei’s slaves ran off to Achish son of Maakah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, “Your slaves are in Gath.” 
1KI.2.40	At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath.
1KI.2.41	When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, 
1KI.2.42	the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the 
1KI.2.43	Why then did you not keep your oath to the 
1KI.2.44	The king also said to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the 
1KI.2.45	But King Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will remain secure before the 
1KI.2.46	Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and he died.
1KI.2.46	The kingdom was now established in Solomon’s hands.
1KI.3.1	Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt and married his daughter. He brought her to the City of David until he finished building his palace and the temple of the 
1KI.3.2	The people, however, were still sacrificing at the high places, because a temple had not yet been built for the Name of the 
1KI.3.3	Solomon showed his love for the 
1KI.3.4	The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for that was the most important high place, and Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. 
1KI.3.5	At Gibeon the 
1KI.3.6	Solomon answered, “You have shown great kindness to your servant, my father David, because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day.
1KI.3.7	“Now, 
1KI.3.8	Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to count or number. 
1KI.3.9	So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?”
1KI.3.10	The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this. 
1KI.3.11	So God said to him, “Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice, 
1KI.3.12	I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be. 
1KI.3.13	Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for—both wealth and honor—so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings. 
1KI.3.14	And if you walk in obedience to me and keep my decrees and commands as David your father did, I will give you a long life.” 
1KI.3.15	Then Solomon awoke—and he realized it had been a dream.
1KI.3.15	He returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord’s covenant and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he gave a feast for all his court.
1KI.3.16	Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. 
1KI.3.17	One of them said, “Pardon me, my lord. This woman and I live in the same house, and I had a baby while she was there with me. 
1KI.3.18	The third day after my child was born, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one in the house but the two of us.
1KI.3.19	“During the night this woman’s son died because she lay on him. 
1KI.3.20	So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I your servant was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast. 
1KI.3.21	The next morning, I got up to nurse my son—and he was dead! But when I looked at him closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn’t the son I had borne.”
1KI.3.22	The other woman said, “No! The living one is my son; the dead one is yours.”
1KI.3.22	But the first one insisted, “No! The dead one is yours; the living one is mine.” And so they argued before the king.
1KI.3.23	The king said, “This one says, ‘My son is alive and your son is dead,’ while that one says, ‘No! Your son is dead and mine is alive.’ ”
1KI.3.24	Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword for the king. 
1KI.3.25	He then gave an order: “Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.”
1KI.3.26	The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for her son and said to the king, “Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don’t kill him!”
1KI.3.26	But the other said, “Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!”
1KI.3.27	Then the king gave his ruling: “Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother.”
1KI.3.28	When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.
1KI.4.1	So King Solomon ruled over all Israel. 
1KI.4.2	And these were his chief officials:
1KI.4.2	Azariah son of Zadok—the priest;
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha—secretaries;
1KI.4.3	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud—recorder;
1KI.4.4	Benaiah son of Jehoiada—commander in chief;
1KI.4.4	Zadok and Abiathar—priests;
1KI.4.5	Azariah son of Nathan—in charge of the district governors;
1KI.4.5	Zabud son of Nathan—a priest and adviser to the king;
1KI.4.6	Ahishar—palace administrator;
1KI.4.6	Adoniram son of Abda—in charge of forced labor.
1KI.4.7	Solomon had twelve district governors over all Israel, who supplied provisions for the king and the royal household. Each one had to provide supplies for one month in the year. 
1KI.4.8	These are their names:
1KI.4.8	Ben-Hur—in the hill country of Ephraim;
1KI.4.9	Ben-Deker—in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh and Elon Bethhanan;
1KI.4.10	Ben-Hesed—in Arubboth (Sokoh and all the land of Hepher were his);
1KI.4.11	Ben-Abinadab—in Naphoth Dor (he was married to Taphath daughter of Solomon);
1KI.4.12	Baana son of Ahilud—in Taanach and Megiddo, and in all of Beth Shan next to Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth Shan to Abel Meholah across to Jokmeam;
1KI.4.13	Ben-Geber—in Ramoth Gilead (the settlements of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead were his, as well as the region of Argob in Bashan and its sixty large walled cities with bronze gate bars);
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab son of Iddo—in Mahanaim;
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz—in Naphtali (he had married Basemath daughter of Solomon);
1KI.4.16	Baana son of Hushai—in Asher and in Aloth;
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat son of Paruah—in Issachar;
1KI.4.18	Shimei son of Ela—in Benjamin;
1KI.4.19	Geber son of Uri—in Gilead (the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and the country of Og king of Bashan). He was the only governor over the district.
1KI.4.20	The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore; they ate, they drank and they were happy. 
1KI.4.21	And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These countries brought tribute and were Solomon’s subjects all his life.
1KI.4.22	Solomon’s daily provisions were thirty cors
1KI.4.23	ten head of stall-fed cattle, twenty of pasture-fed cattle and a hundred sheep and goats, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks and choice fowl. 
1KI.4.24	For he ruled over all the kingdoms west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, and had peace on all sides. 
1KI.4.25	During Solomon’s lifetime Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, lived in safety, everyone under their own vine and under their own fig tree.
1KI.4.26	Solomon had four
1KI.4.27	The district governors, each in his month, supplied provisions for King Solomon and all who came to the king’s table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking. 
1KI.4.28	They also brought to the proper place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and the other horses.
1KI.4.29	God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore. 
1KI.4.30	Solomon’s wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East, and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt. 
1KI.4.31	He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite—wiser than Heman, Kalkol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations. 
1KI.4.32	He spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five. 
1KI.4.33	He spoke about plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls. He also spoke about animals and birds, reptiles and fish. 
1KI.4.34	From all nations people came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, sent by all the kings of the world, who had heard of his wisdom.
1KI.5.1	When Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father David, he sent his envoys to Solomon, because he had always been on friendly terms with David. 
1KI.5.2	Solomon sent back this message to Hiram:
1KI.5.3	“You know that because of the wars waged against my father David from all sides, he could not build a temple for the Name of the 
1KI.5.4	But now the 
1KI.5.5	I intend, therefore, to build a temple for the Name of the 
1KI.5.6	“So give orders that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. My men will work with yours, and I will pay you for your men whatever wages you set. You know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the Sidonians.”
1KI.5.7	When Hiram heard Solomon’s message, he was greatly pleased and said, “Praise be to the 
1KI.5.8	So Hiram sent word to Solomon:
1KI.5.8	“I have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and juniper logs. 
1KI.5.9	My men will haul them down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea, and I will float them as rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate them and you can take them away. And you are to grant my wish by providing food for my royal household.”
1KI.5.10	In this way Hiram kept Solomon supplied with all the cedar and juniper logs he wanted, 
1KI.5.11	and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors
1KI.5.12	The 
1KI.5.13	King Solomon conscripted laborers from all Israel—thirty thousand men. 
1KI.5.14	He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month, so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. 
1KI.5.15	Solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills, 
1KI.5.16	as well as thirty-three hundred
1KI.5.17	At the king’s command they removed from the quarry large blocks of high-grade stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple. 
1KI.5.18	The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and workers from Byblos cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple.
1KI.6.1	In the four hundred and eightieth
1KI.6.2	The temple that King Solomon built for the 
1KI.6.3	The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits,
1KI.6.4	He made narrow windows high up in the temple walls. 
1KI.6.5	Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms. 
1KI.6.6	The lowest floor was five cubits
1KI.6.7	In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built.
1KI.6.8	The entrance to the lowest
1KI.6.9	So he built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks. 
1KI.6.10	And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits, and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar.
1KI.6.11	The word of the 
1KI.6.12	“As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, observe my laws and keep all my commands and obey them, I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father. 
1KI.6.13	And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel.”
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the temple and completed it. 
1KI.6.15	He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of juniper. 
1KI.6.16	He partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. 
1KI.6.17	The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits
1KI.6.18	The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen.
1KI.6.19	He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.6.20	The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty wide and twenty high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar. 
1KI.6.21	Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold. 
1KI.6.22	So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.
1KI.6.23	For the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim out of olive wood, each ten cubits high. 
1KI.6.24	One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing five cubits—ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip. 
1KI.6.25	The second cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape. 
1KI.6.26	The height of each cherub was ten cubits. 
1KI.6.27	He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room. 
1KI.6.28	He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1KI.6.29	On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers. 
1KI.6.30	He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.
1KI.6.31	For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors out of olive wood that were one fifth of the width of the sanctuary. 
1KI.6.32	And on the two olive-wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold. 
1KI.6.33	In the same way, for the entrance to the main hall he made doorframes out of olive wood that were one fourth of the width of the hall. 
1KI.6.34	He also made two doors out of juniper wood, each having two leaves that turned in sockets. 
1KI.6.35	He carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings.
1KI.6.36	And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams.
1KI.6.37	The foundation of the temple of the 
1KI.6.38	In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it.
1KI.7.1	It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace. 
1KI.7.2	He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high,
1KI.7.3	It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns—forty-five beams, fifteen to a row. 
1KI.7.4	Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other. 
1KI.7.5	All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other.
1KI.7.6	He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide.
1KI.7.7	He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.
1KI.7.8	And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.
1KI.7.9	All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and smoothed on their inner and outer faces. 
1KI.7.10	The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits
1KI.7.11	Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams. 
1KI.7.12	The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the 
1KI.7.13	King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram,
1KI.7.14	whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was from Tyre and a skilled craftsman in bronze. Huram was filled with wisdom, with understanding and with knowledge to do all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him.
1KI.7.15	He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference.
1KI.7.16	He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits
1KI.7.17	A network of interwoven chains adorned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital. 
1KI.7.18	He made pomegranates in two rows
1KI.7.19	The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits
1KI.7.20	On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around. 
1KI.7.21	He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin
1KI.7.22	The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed.
1KI.7.23	He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits
1KI.7.24	Below the rim, gourds encircled it—ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.
1KI.7.25	The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. 
1KI.7.26	It was a handbreadth
1KI.7.27	He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high.
1KI.7.28	This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights. 
1KI.7.29	On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim—and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work. 
1KI.7.30	Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side. 
1KI.7.31	On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit
1KI.7.32	The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half. 
1KI.7.33	The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal.
1KI.7.34	Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand. 
1KI.7.35	At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit
1KI.7.36	He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around. 
1KI.7.37	This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape.
1KI.7.38	He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths
1KI.7.39	He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple. 
1KI.7.40	He also made the pots
1KI.7.40	So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the 
1KI.7.41	the two pillars;
1KI.7.41	the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
1KI.7.41	the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
1KI.7.42	the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);
1KI.7.43	the ten stands with their ten basins;
1KI.7.44	the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;
1KI.7.45	the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls.
1KI.7.45	All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the 
1KI.7.46	The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Sukkoth and Zarethan. 
1KI.7.47	Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.
1KI.7.48	Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the 
1KI.7.48	the golden altar;
1KI.7.48	the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;
1KI.7.49	the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary);
1KI.7.49	the gold floral work and lamps and tongs;
1KI.7.50	the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers;
1KI.7.50	and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple.
1KI.7.51	When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the 
1KI.8.1	Then King Solomon summoned into his presence at Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the 
1KI.8.2	All the Israelites came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month.
1KI.8.3	When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark, 
1KI.8.4	and they brought up the ark of the 
1KI.8.5	and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.
1KI.8.6	The priests then brought the ark of the 
1KI.8.7	The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles. 
1KI.8.8	These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today. 
1KI.8.9	There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the 
1KI.8.10	When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the 
1KI.8.11	And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the 
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon said, “The 
1KI.8.13	I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever.”
1KI.8.14	While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them. 
1KI.8.15	Then he said:
1KI.8.15	“Praise be to the 
1KI.8.16	‘Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, but I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.’
1KI.8.17	“My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the 
1KI.8.18	But the 
1KI.8.19	Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood—he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.’
1KI.8.20	“The 
1KI.8.21	I have provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant of the 
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the 
1KI.8.23	and said:
1KI.8.23	“
1KI.8.24	You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it—as it is today.
1KI.8.25	“Now 
1KI.8.26	And now, God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David my father come true.
1KI.8.27	“But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built! 
1KI.8.28	Yet give attention to your servant’s prayer and his plea for mercy, 
1KI.8.29	May your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, this place of which you said, ‘My Name shall be there,’ so that you will hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place. 
1KI.8.30	Hear the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.
1KI.8.31	“When anyone wrongs their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before your altar in this temple, 
1KI.8.32	then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty by bringing down on their heads what they have done, and vindicating the innocent by treating them in accordance with their innocence.
1KI.8.33	“When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you, and when they turn back to you and give praise to your name, praying and making supplication to you in this temple, 
1KI.8.34	then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to their ancestors.
1KI.8.35	“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them, 
1KI.8.36	then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.
1KI.8.37	“When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when an enemy besieges them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come, 
1KI.8.38	and when a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people Israel—being aware of the afflictions of their own hearts, and spreading out their hands toward this temple— 
1KI.8.39	then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive and act; deal with everyone according to all they do, since you know their hearts (for you alone know every human heart), 
1KI.8.40	so that they will fear you all the time they live in the land you gave our ancestors.
1KI.8.41	“As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your name— 
1KI.8.42	for they will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when they come and pray toward this temple, 
1KI.8.43	then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.
1KI.8.44	“When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to the 
1KI.8.45	then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
1KI.8.46	“When they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you become angry with them and give them over to their enemies, who take them captive to their own lands, far away or near; 
1KI.8.47	and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captors and say, ‘We have sinned, we have done wrong, we have acted wickedly’; 
1KI.8.48	and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and pray to you toward the land you gave their ancestors, toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name; 
1KI.8.49	then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause. 
1KI.8.50	And forgive your people, who have sinned against you; forgive all the offenses they have committed against you, and cause their captors to show them mercy; 
1KI.8.51	for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, out of that iron-smelting furnace.
1KI.8.52	“May your eyes be open to your servant’s plea and to the plea of your people Israel, and may you listen to them whenever they cry out to you. 
1KI.8.53	For you singled them out from all the nations of the world to be your own inheritance, just as you declared through your servant Moses when you, Sovereign 
1KI.8.54	When Solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the 
1KI.8.55	He stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying:
1KI.8.56	“Praise be to the 
1KI.8.57	May the 
1KI.8.58	May he turn our hearts to him, to walk in obedience to him and keep the commands, decrees and laws he gave our ancestors. 
1KI.8.59	And may these words of mine, which I have prayed before the 
1KI.8.60	so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the 
1KI.8.61	And may your hearts be fully committed to the 
1KI.8.62	Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the 
1KI.8.63	Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the 
1KI.8.64	On that same day the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the 
1KI.8.65	So Solomon observed the festival at that time, and all Israel with him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. They celebrated it before the 
1KI.8.66	On the following day he sent the people away. They blessed the king and then went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the 
1KI.9.1	When Solomon had finished building the temple of the 
1KI.9.2	the 
1KI.9.3	The 
1KI.9.3	“I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
1KI.9.4	“As for you, if you walk before me faithfully with integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws, 
1KI.9.5	I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’
1KI.9.6	“But if you
1KI.9.7	then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples. 
1KI.9.8	This temple will become a heap of rubble. All
1KI.9.9	People will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the 
1KI.9.10	At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings—the temple of the 
1KI.9.11	King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and juniper and gold he wanted. 
1KI.9.12	But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them. 
1KI.9.13	“What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?” he asked. And he called them the Land of Kabul,
1KI.9.14	Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents
1KI.9.15	Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the 
1KI.9.16	(Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. 
1KI.9.17	And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon, 
1KI.9.18	Baalath, and Tadmor
1KI.9.19	as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses
1KI.9.20	There were still people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites). 
1KI.9.21	Solomon conscripted the descendants of all these peoples remaining in the land—whom the Israelites could not exterminate
1KI.9.22	But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers. 
1KI.9.23	They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon’s projects—550 officials supervising those who did the work.
1KI.9.24	After Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the terraces.
1KI.9.25	Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the 
1KI.9.26	King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.
1KI.9.27	And Hiram sent his men—sailors who knew the sea—to serve in the fleet with Solomon’s men. 
1KI.9.28	They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents
1KI.10.1	When the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his relationship to the 
1KI.10.2	Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones—she came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind. 
1KI.10.3	Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her. 
1KI.10.4	When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built, 
1KI.10.5	the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he made at
1KI.10.6	She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true. 
1KI.10.7	But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told me; in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report I heard. 
1KI.10.8	How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! 
1KI.10.9	Praise be to the 
1KI.10.10	And she gave the king 120 talents
1KI.10.11	(Hiram’s ships brought gold from Ophir; and from there they brought great cargoes of almugwood
1KI.10.12	The king used the almugwood to make supports
1KI.10.13	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for, besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.
1KI.10.14	The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,
1KI.10.15	not including the revenues from merchants and traders and from all the Arabian kings and the governors of the territories.
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels
1KI.10.17	He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three minas
1KI.10.18	Then the king made a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with fine gold. 
1KI.10.19	The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them. 
1KI.10.20	Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom. 
1KI.10.21	All King Solomon’s goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon’s days. 
1KI.10.22	The king had a fleet of trading ships
1KI.10.23	King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth. 
1KI.10.24	The whole world sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart. 
1KI.10.25	Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift—articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules.
1KI.10.26	Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses,
1KI.10.27	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. 
1KI.10.28	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue
1KI.10.29	They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty.
1KI.11.1	King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh’s daughter—Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites. 
1KI.11.2	They were from nations about which the 
1KI.11.3	He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. 
1KI.11.4	As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the 
1KI.11.5	He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.6	So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.11.7	On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.8	He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.
1KI.11.9	The 
1KI.11.10	Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the 
1KI.11.11	So the 
1KI.11.12	Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son. 
1KI.11.13	Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.”
1KI.11.14	Then the 
1KI.11.15	Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom. 
1KI.11.16	Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom. 
1KI.11.17	But Hadad, still only a boy, fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father. 
1KI.11.18	They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking people from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.
1KI.11.19	Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage. 
1KI.11.20	The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaoh’s own children.
1KI.11.21	While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his ancestors and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own country.”
1KI.11.22	“What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?” Pharaoh asked.
1KI.11.22	“Nothing,” Hadad replied, “but do let me go!”
1KI.11.23	And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah. 
1KI.11.24	When David destroyed Zobah’s army, Rezon gathered a band of men around him and became their leader; they went to Damascus, where they settled and took control. 
1KI.11.25	Rezon was Israel’s adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.
1KI.11.26	Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon’s officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.
1KI.11.27	Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the terraces
1KI.11.28	Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the tribes of Joseph.
1KI.11.29	About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country, 
1KI.11.30	and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces. 
1KI.11.31	Then he said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the 
1KI.11.32	But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe. 
1KI.11.33	I will do this because they have
1KI.11.34	“ ‘But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon’s hand; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and decrees. 
1KI.11.35	I will take the kingdom from his son’s hands and give you ten tribes. 
1KI.11.36	I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name. 
1KI.11.37	However, as for you, I will take you, and you will rule over all that your heart desires; you will be king over Israel. 
1KI.11.38	If you do whatever I command you and walk in obedience to me and do what is right in my eyes by obeying my decrees and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you. I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David and will give Israel to you. 
1KI.11.39	I will humble David’s descendants because of this, but not forever.’ ”
1KI.11.40	Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king, and stayed there until Solomon’s death.
1KI.11.41	As for the other events of Solomon’s reign—all he did and the wisdom he displayed—are they not written in the book of the annals of Solomon? 
1KI.11.42	Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
1KI.11.43	Then he rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
1KI.12.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from
1KI.12.3	So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him: 
1KI.12.4	“Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”
1KI.12.5	Rehoboam answered, “Go away for three days and then come back to me.” So the people went away.
1KI.12.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How would you advise me to answer these people?” he asked.
1KI.12.7	They replied, “If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.”
1KI.12.8	But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. 
1KI.12.9	He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”
1KI.12.10	The young men who had grown up with him replied, “These people have said to you, ‘Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.’ Now tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. 
1KI.12.11	My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.’ ”
1KI.12.12	Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, “Come back to me in three days.” 
1KI.12.13	The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders, 
1KI.12.14	he followed the advice of the young men and said, “My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.” 
1KI.12.15	So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the 
1KI.12.16	When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king:
1KI.12.16	“What share do we have in David,
1KI.12.16	what part in Jesse’s son?
1KI.12.16	To your tents, Israel!
1KI.12.16	Look after your own house, David!”
1KI.12.16	So the Israelites went home. 
1KI.12.17	But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.
1KI.12.18	King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram,
1KI.12.19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
1KI.12.20	When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.
1KI.12.21	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered all Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—a hundred and eighty thousand able young men—to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon.
1KI.12.22	But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God: 
1KI.12.23	“Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, to all Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, 
1KI.12.24	‘This is what the 
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel.
1KI.12.26	Jeroboam thought to himself, “The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David. 
1KI.12.27	If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the 
1KI.12.28	After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.” 
1KI.12.29	One he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	And this thing became a sin; the people came to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other.
1KI.12.31	Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, even though they were not Levites. 
1KI.12.32	He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made. 
1KI.12.33	On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings.
1KI.13.1	By the word of the 
1KI.13.2	By the word of the 
1KI.13.3	That same day the man of God gave a sign: “This is the sign the 
1KI.13.4	When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, “Seize him!” But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, so that he could not pull it back. 
1KI.13.5	Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the 
1KI.13.6	Then the king said to the man of God, “Intercede with the 
1KI.13.7	The king said to the man of God, “Come home with me for a meal, and I will give you a gift.”
1KI.13.8	But the man of God answered the king, “Even if you were to give me half your possessions, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water here. 
1KI.13.9	For I was commanded by the word of the 
1KI.13.10	So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king. 
1KI.13.12	Their father asked them, “Which way did he go?” And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken. 
1KI.13.13	So he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” And when they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it 
1KI.13.14	and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?”
1KI.13.14	“I am,” he replied.
1KI.13.15	So the prophet said to him, “Come home with me and eat.”
1KI.13.16	The man of God said, “I cannot turn back and go with you, nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. 
1KI.13.17	I have been told by the word of the 
1KI.13.18	The old prophet answered, “I too am a prophet, as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the 
1KI.13.19	So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house.
1KI.13.20	While they were sitting at the table, the word of the 
1KI.13.21	He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, “This is what the 
1KI.13.22	You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your ancestors.’ ”
1KI.13.23	When the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him. 
1KI.13.24	As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was left lying on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it. 
1KI.13.25	Some people who passed by saw the body lying there, with the lion standing beside the body, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived.
1KI.13.26	When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who defied the word of the 
1KI.13.27	The prophet said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me,” and they did so. 
1KI.13.28	Then he went out and found the body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him. 
1KI.13.30	Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him and said, “Alas, my brother!”
1KI.13.31	After burying him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. 
1KI.13.32	For the message he declared by the word of the 
1KI.13.33	Even after this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places. 
1KI.13.34	This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its downfall and to its destruction from the face of the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, 
1KI.14.2	and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Go, disguise yourself, so you won’t be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there—the one who told me I would be king over this people. 
1KI.14.3	Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.” 
1KI.14.4	So Jeroboam’s wife did what he said and went to Ahijah’s house in Shiloh.
1KI.14.4	Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age. 
1KI.14.5	But the 
1KI.14.6	So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news. 
1KI.14.7	Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the 
1KI.14.8	I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes. 
1KI.14.9	You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made for yourself other gods, idols made of metal; you have aroused my anger and turned your back on me.
1KI.14.10	“ ‘Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every last male in Israel—slave or free.
1KI.14.11	Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country. The 
1KI.14.12	“As for you, go back home. When you set foot in your city, the boy will die. 
1KI.14.13	All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the 
1KI.14.14	“The 
1KI.14.15	And the 
1KI.14.16	And he will give Israel up because of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.”
1KI.14.17	Then Jeroboam’s wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died. 
1KI.14.18	They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, as the 
1KI.14.19	The other events of Jeroboam’s reign, his wars and how he ruled, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel. 
1KI.14.20	He reigned for twenty-two years and then rested with his ancestors. And Nadab his son succeeded him as king.
1KI.14.21	Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the 
1KI.14.22	Judah did evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.14.23	They also set up for themselves high places, sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree. 
1KI.14.24	There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the 
1KI.14.25	In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. 
1KI.14.26	He carried off the treasures of the temple of the 
1KI.14.27	So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. 
1KI.14.28	Whenever the king went to the 
1KI.14.29	As for the other events of Rehoboam’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
1KI.14.30	There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 
1KI.14.31	And Rehoboam rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. His mother’s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. And Abijah
1KI.15.1	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijah
1KI.15.2	and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maakah daughter of Abishalom.
1KI.15.3	He committed all the sins his father had done before him; his heart was not fully devoted to the 
1KI.15.4	Nevertheless, for David’s sake the 
1KI.15.5	For David had done what was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.6	There was war between Abijah
1KI.15.7	As for the other events of Abijah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
1KI.15.8	And Abijah rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Asa his son succeeded him as king.
1KI.15.9	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king of Judah, 
1KI.15.10	and he reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years. His grandmother’s name was Maakah daughter of Abishalom.
1KI.15.11	Asa did what was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.12	He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his ancestors had made. 
1KI.15.13	He even deposed his grandmother Maakah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah. Asa cut it down and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
1KI.15.14	Although he did not remove the high places, Asa’s heart was fully committed to the 
1KI.15.15	He brought into the temple of the 
1KI.15.16	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns. 
1KI.15.17	Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
1KI.15.18	Asa then took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the 
1KI.15.19	“Let there be a treaty between me and you,” he said, “as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me.”
1KI.15.20	Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maakah and all Kinnereth in addition to Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah. 
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa issued an order to all Judah—no one was exempt—and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using there. With them King Asa built up Geba in Benjamin, and also Mizpah.
1KI.15.23	As for all the other events of Asa’s reign, all his achievements, all he did and the cities he built, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? In his old age, however, his feet became diseased. 
1KI.15.24	Then Asa rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of his father David. And Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king.
1KI.15.25	Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. 
1KI.15.26	He did evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.27	Baasha son of Ahijah from the tribe of Issachar plotted against him, and he struck him down at Gibbethon, a Philistine town, while Nadab and all Israel were besieging it. 
1KI.15.28	Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of Asa king of Judah and succeeded him as king.
1KI.15.29	As soon as he began to reign, he killed Jeroboam’s whole family. He did not leave Jeroboam anyone that breathed, but destroyed them all, according to the word of the 
1KI.15.30	This happened because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he aroused the anger of the 
1KI.15.31	As for the other events of Nadab’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.15.32	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned twenty-four years. 
1KI.15.34	He did evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.16.1	Then the word of the 
1KI.16.2	“I lifted you up from the dust and appointed you ruler over my people Israel, but you followed the ways of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin and to arouse my anger by their sins. 
1KI.16.3	So I am about to wipe out Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	Dogs will eat those belonging to Baasha who die in the city, and birds will feed on those who die in the country.”
1KI.16.5	As for the other events of Baasha’s reign, what he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.6	Baasha rested with his ancestors and was buried in Tirzah. And Elah his son succeeded him as king.
1KI.16.7	Moreover, the word of the 
1KI.16.8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years.
1KI.16.9	Zimri, one of his officials, who had command of half his chariots, plotted against him. Elah was in Tirzah at the time, getting drunk in the home of Arza, the palace administrator at Tirzah. 
1KI.16.10	Zimri came in, struck him down and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah. Then he succeeded him as king.
1KI.16.11	As soon as he began to reign and was seated on the throne, he killed off Baasha’s whole family. He did not spare a single male, whether relative or friend. 
1KI.16.12	So Zimri destroyed the whole family of Baasha, in accordance with the word of the 
1KI.16.13	because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, so that they aroused the anger of the 
1KI.16.14	As for the other events of Elah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah seven days. The army was encamped near Gibbethon, a Philistine town. 
1KI.16.16	When the Israelites in the camp heard that Zimri had plotted against the king and murdered him, they proclaimed Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that very day there in the camp. 
1KI.16.17	Then Omri and all the Israelites with him withdrew from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the royal palace and set the palace on fire around him. So he died, 
1KI.16.19	because of the sins he had committed, doing evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.16.20	As for the other events of Zimri’s reign, and the rebellion he carried out, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.21	Then the people of Israel were split into two factions; half supported Tibni son of Ginath for king, and the other half supported Omri. 
1KI.16.22	But Omri’s followers proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king.
1KI.16.23	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah. 
1KI.16.24	He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents
1KI.16.25	But Omri did evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.16.26	He followed completely the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, committing the same sin Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit, so that they aroused the anger of the 
1KI.16.27	As for the other events of Omri’s reign, what he did and the things he achieved, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.28	Omri rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Ahab his son succeeded him as king.
1KI.16.29	In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria over Israel twenty-two years. 
1KI.16.30	Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.16.31	He not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, but he also married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and worship him. 
1KI.16.32	He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he built in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	Ahab also made an Asherah pole and did more to arouse the anger of the 
1KI.16.34	In Ahab’s time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with the word of the 
1KI.17.1	Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe
1KI.17.2	Then the word of the 
1KI.17.3	“Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan. 
1KI.17.4	You will drink from the brook, and I have directed the ravens to supply you with food there.”
1KI.17.5	So he did what the 
1KI.17.6	The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.
1KI.17.7	Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land. 
1KI.17.8	Then the word of the 
1KI.17.9	“Go at once to Zarephath in the region of Sidon and stay there. I have directed a widow there to supply you with food.” 
1KI.17.10	So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, “Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?” 
1KI.17.11	As she was going to get it, he called, “And bring me, please, a piece of bread.”
1KI.17.12	“As surely as the 
1KI.17.13	Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son. 
1KI.17.14	For this is what the 
1KI.17.15	She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family. 
1KI.17.16	For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the 
1KI.17.17	Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing. 
1KI.17.18	She said to Elijah, “What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?”
1KI.17.19	“Give me your son,” Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed. 
1KI.17.20	Then he cried out to the 
1KI.17.21	Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried out to the 
1KI.17.22	The 
1KI.17.23	Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, “Look, your son is alive!”
1KI.17.24	Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the 
1KI.18.1	After a long time, in the third year, the word of the 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab.
1KI.18.2	Now the famine was severe in Samaria, 
1KI.18.3	and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, his palace administrator. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the 
1KI.18.4	While Jezebel was killing off the 
1KI.18.5	Ahab had said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.” 
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another.
1KI.18.7	As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, “Is it really you, my lord Elijah?”
1KI.18.8	“Yes,” he replied. “Go tell your master, ‘Elijah is here.’ ”
1KI.18.9	“What have I done wrong,” asked Obadiah, “that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death? 
1KI.18.10	As surely as the 
1KI.18.11	But now you tell me to go to my master and say, ‘Elijah is here.’ 
1KI.18.12	I don’t know where the Spirit of the 
1KI.18.13	Haven’t you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the 
1KI.18.14	And now you tell me to go to my master and say, ‘Elijah is here.’ He will kill me!”
1KI.18.15	Elijah said, “As the 
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
1KI.18.17	When he saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”
1KI.18.18	“I have not made trouble for Israel,” Elijah replied. “But you and your father’s family have. You have abandoned the 
1KI.18.19	Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	Elijah went before the people and said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the 
1KI.18.21	But the people said nothing.
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to them, “I am the only one of the 
1KI.18.23	Get two bulls for us. Let Baal’s prophets choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. 
1KI.18.24	Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the 
1KI.18.24	Then all the people said, “What you say is good.”
1KI.18.25	Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.” 
1KI.18.26	So they took the bull given them and prepared it.
1KI.18.26	Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. “Baal, answer us!” they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made.
1KI.18.27	At noon Elijah began to taunt them. “Shout louder!” he said. “Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.” 
1KI.18.28	So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed. 
1KI.18.29	Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come here to me.” They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the 
1KI.18.31	Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the 
1KI.18.32	With the stones he built an altar in the name of the 
1KI.18.33	He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, “Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.”
1KI.18.34	“Do it again,” he said, and they did it again.
1KI.18.34	“Do it a third time,” he ordered, and they did it the third time. 
1KI.18.35	The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.
1KI.18.36	At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: “
1KI.18.37	Answer me, 
1KI.18.38	Then the fire of the 
1KI.18.39	When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, “The 
1KI.18.40	Then Elijah commanded them, “Seize the prophets of Baal. Don’t let anyone get away!” They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.
1KI.18.41	And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.” 
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees.
1KI.18.43	“Go and look toward the sea,” he told his servant. And he went up and looked.
1KI.18.43	“There is nothing there,” he said.
1KI.18.43	Seven times Elijah said, “Go back.”
1KI.18.44	The seventh time the servant reported, “A cloud as small as a man’s hand is rising from the sea.”
1KI.18.44	So Elijah said, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’ ”
1KI.18.45	Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain started falling and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. 
1KI.18.46	The power of the 
1KI.19.1	Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 
1KI.19.2	So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.”
1KI.19.3	Elijah was afraid
1KI.19.4	while he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness. He came to a broom bush, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, 
1KI.19.5	Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep.
1KI.19.5	All at once an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.” 
1KI.19.6	He looked around, and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.
1KI.19.7	The angel of the 
1KI.19.8	So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. 
1KI.19.9	There he went into a cave and spent the night.
1KI.19.9	And the word of the 
1KI.19.10	He replied, “I have been very zealous for the 
1KI.19.11	The 
1KI.19.11	Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the 
1KI.19.12	After the earthquake came a fire, but the 
1KI.19.13	When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave.
1KI.19.13	Then a voice said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
1KI.19.14	He replied, “I have been very zealous for the 
1KI.19.15	The 
1KI.19.16	Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet. 
1KI.19.17	Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu. 
1KI.19.18	Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him.”
1KI.19.19	So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. 
1KI.19.20	Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. “Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye,” he said, “and then I will come with you.”
1KI.19.20	“Go back,” Elijah replied. “What have I done to you?”
1KI.19.21	So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant.
1KI.20.1	Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram mustered his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he went up and besieged Samaria and attacked it. 
1KI.20.2	He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying, “This is what Ben-Hadad says: 
1KI.20.3	‘Your silver and gold are mine, and the best of your wives and children are mine.’ ”
1KI.20.4	The king of Israel answered, “Just as you say, my lord the king. I and all I have are yours.”
1KI.20.5	The messengers came again and said, “This is what Ben-Hadad says: ‘I sent to demand your silver and gold, your wives and your children. 
1KI.20.6	But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will seize everything you value and carry it away.’ ”
1KI.20.7	The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them, “See how this man is looking for trouble! When he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, I did not refuse him.”
1KI.20.8	The elders and the people all answered, “Don’t listen to him or agree to his demands.”
1KI.20.9	So he replied to Ben-Hadad’s messengers, “Tell my lord the king, ‘Your servant will do all you demanded the first time, but this demand I cannot meet.’ ” They left and took the answer back to Ben-Hadad.
1KI.20.10	Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab: “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in Samaria to give each of my men a handful.”
1KI.20.11	The king of Israel answered, “Tell him: ‘One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off.’ ”
1KI.20.12	Ben-Hadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents,
1KI.20.13	Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and announced, “This is what the 
1KI.20.14	“But who will do this?” asked Ahab.
1KI.20.14	The prophet replied, “This is what the 
1KI.20.14	“And who will start the battle?” he asked.
1KI.20.14	The prophet answered, “You will.”
1KI.20.15	So Ahab summoned the 232 junior officers under the provincial commanders. Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites, 7,000 in all. 
1KI.20.16	They set out at noon while Ben-Hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk. 
1KI.20.17	The junior officers under the provincial commanders went out first.
1KI.20.17	Now Ben-Hadad had dispatched scouts, who reported, “Men are advancing from Samaria.”
1KI.20.18	He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have come out for war, take them alive.”
1KI.20.19	The junior officers under the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them 
1KI.20.20	and each one struck down his opponent. At that, the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen. 
1KI.20.21	The king of Israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the Arameans.
1KI.20.22	Afterward, the prophet came to the king of Israel and said, “Strengthen your position and see what must be done, because next spring the king of Aram will attack you again.”
1KI.20.23	Meanwhile, the officials of the king of Aram advised him, “Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were too strong for us. But if we fight them on the plains, surely we will be stronger than they. 
1KI.20.24	Do this: Remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers. 
1KI.20.25	You must also raise an army like the one you lost—horse for horse and chariot for chariot—so we can fight Israel on the plains. Then surely we will be stronger than they.” He agreed with them and acted accordingly.
1KI.20.26	The next spring Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. 
1KI.20.27	When the Israelites were also mustered and given provisions, they marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside.
1KI.20.28	The man of God came up and told the king of Israel, “This is what the 
1KI.20.29	For seven days they camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle was joined. The Israelites inflicted a hundred thousand casualties on the Aramean foot soldiers in one day. 
1KI.20.30	The rest of them escaped to the city of Aphek, where the wall collapsed on twenty-seven thousand of them. And Ben-Hadad fled to the city and hid in an inner room.
1KI.20.31	His officials said to him, “Look, we have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful. Let us go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads. Perhaps he will spare your life.”
1KI.20.32	Wearing sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says: ‘Please let me live.’ ”
1KI.20.32	The king answered, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”
1KI.20.33	The men took this as a good sign and were quick to pick up his word. “Yes, your brother Ben-Hadad!” they said.
1KI.20.33	“Go and get him,” the king said. When Ben-Hadad came out, Ahab had him come up into his chariot.
1KI.20.34	“I will return the cities my father took from your father,” Ben-Hadad offered. “You may set up your own market areas in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.”
1KI.20.34	Ahab said, “On the basis of a treaty I will set you free.” So he made a treaty with him, and let him go.
1KI.20.35	By the word of the 
1KI.20.36	So the prophet said, “Because you have not obeyed the 
1KI.20.37	The prophet found another man and said, “Strike me, please.” So the man struck him and wounded him. 
1KI.20.38	Then the prophet went and stood by the road waiting for the king. He disguised himself with his headband down over his eyes. 
1KI.20.39	As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, “Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and someone came to me with a captive and said, ‘Guard this man. If he is missing, it will be your life for his life, or you must pay a talent
1KI.20.40	While your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared.”
1KI.20.40	“That is your sentence,” the king of Israel said. “You have pronounced it yourself.”
1KI.20.41	Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	He said to the king, “This is what the 
1KI.20.43	Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went to his palace in Samaria.
1KI.21.1	Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. The vineyard was in Jezreel, close to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
1KI.21.2	Ahab said to Naboth, “Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden, since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth.”
1KI.21.3	But Naboth replied, “The 
1KI.21.4	So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors.” He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat.
1KI.21.5	His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, “Why are you so sullen? Why won’t you eat?”
1KI.21.6	He answered her, “Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, ‘Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.’ But he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’ ”
1KI.21.7	Jezebel his wife said, “Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. I’ll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city with him. 
1KI.21.9	In those letters she wrote:
1KI.21.9	“Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people. 
1KI.21.10	But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them bring charges that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death.”
1KI.21.11	So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them. 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people. 
1KI.21.13	Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, “Naboth has cursed both God and the king.” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death. 
1KI.21.14	Then they sent word to Jezebel: “Naboth has been stoned to death.”
1KI.21.15	As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, “Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead.” 
1KI.21.16	When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth’s vineyard.
1KI.21.17	Then the word of the 
1KI.21.18	“Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth’s vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.19	Say to him, ‘This is what the 
1KI.21.20	Ahab said to Elijah, “So you have found me, my enemy!”
1KI.21.20	“I have found you,” he answered, “because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.21.21	He says, ‘I am going to bring disaster on you. I will wipe out your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel—slave or free.
1KI.21.22	I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have aroused my anger and have caused Israel to sin.’
1KI.21.23	“And also concerning Jezebel the 
1KI.21.24	“Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country.”
1KI.21.25	(There was never anyone like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.21.26	He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols, like the Amorites the 
1KI.21.27	When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly.
1KI.21.28	Then the word of the 
1KI.21.29	“Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself, I will not bring this disaster in his day, but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son.”
1KI.22.1	For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel. 
1KI.22.2	But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.3	The king of Israel had said to his officials, “Don’t you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?”
1KI.22.4	So he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?”
1KI.22.4	Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” 
1KI.22.5	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “First seek the counsel of the 
1KI.22.6	So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—about four hundred men—and asked them, “Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?”
1KI.22.6	“Go,” they answered, “for the Lord will give it into the king’s hand.”
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no longer a prophet of the 
1KI.22.8	The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the 
1KI.22.8	“The king should not say such a thing,” Jehoshaphat replied.
1KI.22.9	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”
1KI.22.10	Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. 
1KI.22.11	Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared, “This is what the 
1KI.22.12	All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. “Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious,” they said, “for the 
1KI.22.13	The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.”
1KI.22.14	But Micaiah said, “As surely as the 
1KI.22.15	When he arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or not?”
1KI.22.15	“Attack and be victorious,” he answered, “for the 
1KI.22.16	The king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the 
1KI.22.17	Then Micaiah answered, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the 
1KI.22.18	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?”
1KI.22.19	Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the 
1KI.22.20	And the 
1KI.22.20	“One suggested this, and another that. 
1KI.22.21	Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the 
1KI.22.22	“ ‘By what means?’ the 
1KI.22.22	“ ‘I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said.
1KI.22.22	“ ‘You will succeed in enticing him,’ said the 
1KI.22.23	“So now the 
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. “Which way did the spirit from
1KI.22.25	Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”
1KI.22.26	The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son 
1KI.22.27	and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.’ ”
1KI.22.28	Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the 
1KI.22.29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. 
1KI.22.30	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
1KI.22.31	Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.” 
1KI.22.32	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, “Surely this is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out, 
1KI.22.33	the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him.
1KI.22.34	But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, “Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I’ve been wounded.” 
1KI.22.35	All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died. 
1KI.22.36	As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: “Every man to his town. Every man to his land!”
1KI.22.37	So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there. 
1KI.22.38	They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed),
1KI.22.39	As for the other events of Ahab’s reign, including all he did, the palace he built and adorned with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.22.40	Ahab rested with his ancestors. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
1KI.22.41	Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	In everything he followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.22.44	Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	As for the other events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, the things he achieved and his military exploits, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
1KI.22.46	He rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. 
1KI.22.47	There was then no king in Edom; a provincial governor ruled.
1KI.22.48	Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships
1KI.22.49	At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my men sail with yours,” but Jehoshaphat refused.
1KI.22.50	Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. 
1KI.22.52	He did evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.22.53	He served and worshiped Baal and aroused the anger of the 
2KI.1.1	After Ahab’s death, Moab rebelled against Israel. 
2KI.1.2	Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, “Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury.”
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the 
2KI.1.4	Therefore this is what the 
2KI.1.5	When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have you come back?”
2KI.1.6	“A man came to meet us,” they replied. “And he said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, “This is what the 
2KI.1.7	The king asked them, “What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?”
2KI.1.8	They replied, “He had a garment of hair
2KI.1.8	The king said, “That was Elijah the Tishbite.”
2KI.1.9	Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down!’ ”
2KI.1.10	Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!” Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.
2KI.1.11	At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, “Man of God, this is what the king says, ‘Come down at once!’ ”
2KI.1.12	“If I am a man of God,” Elijah replied, “may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!” Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.
2KI.1.13	So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. “Man of God,” he begged, “please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants! 
2KI.1.14	See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!”
2KI.1.15	The angel of the 
2KI.1.16	He told the king, “This is what the 
2KI.1.17	So he died, according to the word of the 
2KI.1.17	Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram
2KI.1.18	As for all the other events of Ahaziah’s reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
2KI.2.1	When the 
2KI.2.2	Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here; the 
2KI.2.2	But Elisha said, “As surely as the 
2KI.2.3	The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, “Do you know that the 
2KI.2.3	“Yes, I know,” Elisha replied, “so be quiet.”
2KI.2.4	Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here, Elisha; the 
2KI.2.4	And he replied, “As surely as the 
2KI.2.5	The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him, “Do you know that the 
2KI.2.5	“Yes, I know,” he replied, “so be quiet.”
2KI.2.6	Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here; the 
2KI.2.6	And he replied, “As surely as the 
2KI.2.7	Fifty men from the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan. 
2KI.2.8	Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?”
2KI.2.9	“Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,” Elisha replied.
2KI.2.10	“You have asked a difficult thing,” Elijah said, “yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours—otherwise, it will not.”
2KI.2.11	As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. 
2KI.2.12	Elisha saw this and cried out, “My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!” And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his garment and tore it in two.
2KI.2.13	Elisha then picked up Elijah’s cloak that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	He took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and struck the water with it. “Where now is the 
2KI.2.15	The company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, “The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him. 
2KI.2.16	“Look,” they said, “we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the 
2KI.2.16	“No,” Elisha replied, “do not send them.”
2KI.2.17	But they persisted until he was too embarrassed to refuse. So he said, “Send them.” And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him. 
2KI.2.18	When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?”
2KI.2.19	The people of the city said to Elisha, “Look, our lord, this town is well situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive.”
2KI.2.20	“Bring me a new bowl,” he said, “and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him.
2KI.2.21	Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, “This is what the 
2KI.2.22	And the water has remained pure to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.
2KI.2.23	From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they said. “Get out of here, baldy!” 
2KI.2.24	He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Joram
2KI.3.2	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.
2KI.3.4	Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep, and he had to pay the king of Israel a tribute of a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams. 
2KI.3.5	But after Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel. 
2KI.3.7	He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?”
2KI.3.7	“I will go with you,” he replied. “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
2KI.3.8	“By what route shall we attack?” he asked.
2KI.3.8	“Through the Desert of Edom,” he answered.
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days, the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them.
2KI.3.10	“What!” exclaimed the king of Israel. “Has the 
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the 
2KI.3.11	An officer of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the 
2KI.3.13	Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Why do you want to involve me? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.”
2KI.3.13	“No,” the king of Israel answered, “because it was the 
2KI.3.14	Elisha said, “As surely as the 
2KI.3.15	But now bring me a harpist.”
2KI.3.15	While the harpist was playing, the hand of the 
2KI.3.16	and he said, “This is what the 
2KI.3.17	For this is what the 
2KI.3.18	This is an easy thing in the eyes of the 
2KI.3.19	You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones.”
2KI.3.20	The next morning, about the time for offering the sacrifice, there it was—water flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water.
2KI.3.21	Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them; so every man, young and old, who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border. 
2KI.3.22	When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way, the water looked red—like blood. 
2KI.3.23	“That’s blood!” they said. “Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder, Moab!”
2KI.3.24	But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites. 
2KI.3.25	They destroyed the towns, and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place, but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it.
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed. 
2KI.3.27	Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.
2KI.4.1	The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the 
2KI.4.2	Elisha replied to her, “How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?”
2KI.4.2	“Your servant has nothing there at all,” she said, “except a small jar of olive oil.”
2KI.4.3	Elisha said, “Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don’t ask for just a few. 
2KI.4.4	Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side.”
2KI.4.5	She left him and shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring. 
2KI.4.6	When all the jars were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another one.”
2KI.4.6	But he replied, “There is not a jar left.” Then the oil stopped flowing.
2KI.4.7	She went and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what is left.”
2KI.4.8	One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat. 
2KI.4.9	She said to her husband, “I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God. 
2KI.4.10	Let’s make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us.”
2KI.4.11	One day when Elisha came, he went up to his room and lay down there. 
2KI.4.12	He said to his servant Gehazi, “Call the Shunammite.” So he called her, and she stood before him. 
2KI.4.13	Elisha said to him, “Tell her, ‘You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?’ ”
2KI.4.13	She replied, “I have a home among my own people.”
2KI.4.14	“What can be done for her?” Elisha asked.
2KI.4.14	Gehazi said, “She has no son, and her husband is old.”
2KI.4.15	Then Elisha said, “Call her.” So he called her, and she stood in the doorway. 
2KI.4.16	“About this time next year,” Elisha said, “you will hold a son in your arms.”
2KI.4.16	“No, my lord!” she objected. “Please, man of God, don’t mislead your servant!”
2KI.4.17	But the woman became pregnant, and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.
2KI.4.18	The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers. 
2KI.4.19	He said to his father, “My head! My head!”
2KI.4.19	His father told a servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 
2KI.4.20	After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died. 
2KI.4.21	She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out.
2KI.4.22	She called her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return.”
2KI.4.23	“Why go to him today?” he asked. “It’s not the New Moon or the Sabbath.”
2KI.4.23	“That’s all right,” she said.
2KI.4.24	She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Lead on; don’t slow down for me unless I tell you.” 
2KI.4.25	So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.
2KI.4.25	When he saw her in the distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, “Look! There’s the Shunammite! 
2KI.4.26	Run to meet her and ask her, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?’ ”
2KI.4.26	“Everything is all right,” she said.
2KI.4.27	When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the 
2KI.4.28	“Did I ask you for a son, my lord?” she said. “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t raise my hopes’?”
2KI.4.29	Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. Don’t greet anyone you meet, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy’s face.”
2KI.4.30	But the child’s mother said, “As surely as the 
2KI.4.31	Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, “The boy has not awakened.”
2KI.4.32	When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch. 
2KI.4.33	He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the 
2KI.4.34	Then he got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out on him, the boy’s body grew warm. 
2KI.4.35	Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out on him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
2KI.4.36	Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite.” And he did. When she came, he said, “Take your son.” 
2KI.4.37	She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out.
2KI.4.38	Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these prophets.”
2KI.4.39	One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine and picked as many of its gourds as his garment could hold. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were. 
2KI.4.40	The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it.
2KI.4.41	Elisha said, “Get some flour.” He put it into the pot and said, “Serve it to the people to eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
2KI.4.42	A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. “Give it to the people to eat,” Elisha said.
2KI.4.43	“How can I set this before a hundred men?” his servant asked.
2KI.4.43	But Elisha answered, “Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the 
2KI.4.44	Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the 
2KI.5.1	Now Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded, because through him the 
2KI.5.2	Now bands of raiders from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel, and she served Naaman’s wife. 
2KI.5.3	She said to her mistress, “If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.”
2KI.5.4	Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said. 
2KI.5.5	“By all means, go,” the king of Aram replied. “I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman left, taking with him ten talents
2KI.5.6	The letter that he took to the king of Israel read: “With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”
2KI.5.7	As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his robes and said, “Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!”
2KI.5.8	When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes, he sent him this message: “Why have you torn your robes? Have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.” 
2KI.5.9	So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha’s house. 
2KI.5.10	Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, “Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed.”
2KI.5.11	But Naaman went away angry and said, “I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the 
2KI.5.12	Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them and be cleansed?” So he turned and went off in a rage.
2KI.5.13	Naaman’s servants went to him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed’!” 
2KI.5.14	So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had told him, and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy.
2KI.5.15	Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said, “Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.”
2KI.5.16	The prophet answered, “As surely as the 
2KI.5.17	“If you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry, for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the 
2KI.5.18	But may the 
2KI.5.19	“Go in peace,” Elisha said.
2KI.5.19	After Naaman had traveled some distance, 
2KI.5.20	Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, “My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the 
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. “Is everything all right?” he asked.
2KI.5.22	“Everything is all right,” Gehazi answered. “My master sent me to say, ‘Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent
2KI.5.23	“By all means, take two talents,” said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi. 
2KI.5.24	When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left.
2KI.5.25	When he went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?”
2KI.5.25	“Your servant didn’t go anywhere,” Gehazi answered.
2KI.5.26	But Elisha said to him, “Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money or to accept clothes—or olive groves and vineyards, or flocks and herds, or male and female slaves? 
2KI.5.27	Naaman’s leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever.” Then Gehazi went from Elisha’s presence and his skin was leprous—it had become as white as snow.
2KI.6.1	The company of the prophets said to Elisha, “Look, the place where we meet with you is too small for us. 
2KI.6.2	Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to meet.”
2KI.6.2	And he said, “Go.”
2KI.6.3	Then one of them said, “Won’t you please come with your servants?”
2KI.6.3	“I will,” Elisha replied. 
2KI.6.4	And he went with them.
2KI.6.4	They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees. 
2KI.6.5	As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axhead fell into the water. “Oh no, my lord!” he cried out. “It was borrowed!”
2KI.6.6	The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float. 
2KI.6.7	“Lift it out,” he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.
2KI.6.8	Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, “I will set up my camp in such and such a place.”
2KI.6.9	The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there.” 
2KI.6.10	So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places.
2KI.6.11	This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, “Tell me! Which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?”
2KI.6.12	“None of us, my lord the king,” said one of his officers, “but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.”
2KI.6.13	“Go, find out where he is,” the king ordered, “so I can send men and capture him.” The report came back: “He is in Dothan.” 
2KI.6.14	Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city.
2KI.6.15	When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?” the servant asked.
2KI.6.16	“Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”
2KI.6.17	And Elisha prayed, “Open his eyes, 
2KI.6.18	As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the 
2KI.6.19	Elisha told them, “This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.” And he led them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	After they entered the city, Elisha said, “
2KI.6.21	When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?”
2KI.6.22	“Do not kill them,” he answered. “Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master.” 
2KI.6.23	So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel’s territory.
2KI.6.24	Some time later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	There was a great famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty shekels
2KI.6.26	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, “Help me, my lord the king!”
2KI.6.27	The king replied, “If the 
2KI.6.28	Then he asked her, “What’s the matter?”
2KI.6.28	She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we’ll eat my son.’ 
2KI.6.29	So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him,’ but she had hidden him.”
2KI.6.30	When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore his robes. As he went along the wall, the people looked, and they saw that, under his robes, he had sackcloth on his body. 
2KI.6.31	He said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!”
2KI.6.32	Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Don’t you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?” 
2KI.6.33	While he was still talking to them, the messenger came down to him.
2KI.6.33	The king said, “This disaster is from the 
2KI.7.1	Elisha replied, “Hear the word of the 
2KI.7.2	The officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of God, “Look, even if the 
2KI.7.2	“You will see it with your own eyes,” answered Elisha, “but you will not eat any of it!”
2KI.7.3	Now there were four men with leprosy
2KI.7.4	If we say, ‘We’ll go into the city’—the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let’s go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die.”
2KI.7.5	At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, no one was there, 
2KI.7.6	for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!” 
2KI.7.7	So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.
2KI.7.8	The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp, entered one of the tents and ate and drank. Then they took silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also.
2KI.7.9	Then they said to each other, “What we’re doing is not right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let’s go at once and report this to the royal palace.”
2KI.7.10	So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, “We went into the Aramean camp and no one was there—not a sound of anyone—only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were.” 
2KI.7.11	The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace.
2KI.7.12	The king got up in the night and said to his officers, “I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, ‘They will surely come out, and then we will take them alive and get into the city.’ ”
2KI.7.13	One of his officers answered, “Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here—yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened.”
2KI.7.14	So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, “Go and find out what has happened.” 
2KI.7.15	They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king. 
2KI.7.16	Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of the finest flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as the 
2KI.7.17	Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house. 
2KI.7.18	It happened as the man of God had said to the king: “About this time tomorrow, a seah of the finest flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.”
2KI.7.19	The officer had said to the man of God, “Look, even if the 
2KI.7.20	And that is exactly what happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.
2KI.8.1	Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can, because the 
2KI.8.2	The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years.
2KI.8.3	At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to appeal to the king for her house and land. 
2KI.8.4	The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, “Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done.” 
2KI.8.5	Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to appeal to the king for her house and land.
2KI.8.5	Gehazi said, “This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.” 
2KI.8.6	The king asked the woman about it, and she told him.
2KI.8.6	Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, “Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now.”
2KI.8.7	Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, “The man of God has come all the way up here,” 
2KI.8.8	he said to Hazael, “Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God. Consult the 
2KI.8.9	Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him as a gift forty camel-loads of all the finest wares of Damascus. He went in and stood before him, and said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’ ”
2KI.8.10	Elisha answered, “Go and say to him, ‘You will certainly recover.’ Nevertheless,
2KI.8.11	He stared at him with a fixed gaze until Hazael was embarrassed. Then the man of God began to weep.
2KI.8.12	“Why is my lord weeping?” asked Hazael.
2KI.8.12	“Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites,” he answered. “You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women.”
2KI.8.13	Hazael said, “How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?”
2KI.8.13	“The 
2KI.8.14	Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked, “What did Elisha say to you?” Hazael replied, “He told me that you would certainly recover.” 
2KI.8.15	But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it over the king’s face, so that he died. Then Hazael succeeded him as king.
2KI.8.16	In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah. 
2KI.8.17	He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. 
2KI.8.18	He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.8.19	Nevertheless, for the sake of his servant David, the 
2KI.8.20	In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king. 
2KI.8.21	So Jehoram
2KI.8.22	To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time.
2KI.8.23	As for the other events of Jehoram’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.8.24	Jehoram rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	He followed the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.8.28	Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram; 
2KI.8.29	so King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramoth
2KI.8.29	Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab, because he had been wounded.
2KI.9.1	The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of olive oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead. 
2KI.9.2	When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room. 
2KI.9.3	Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare, ‘This is what the 
2KI.9.4	So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead. 
2KI.9.5	When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. “I have a message for you, commander,” he said.
2KI.9.5	“For which of us?” asked Jehu.
2KI.9.5	“For you, commander,” he replied.
2KI.9.6	Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu’s head and declared, “This is what the 
2KI.9.7	You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the 
2KI.9.8	The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel—slave or free.
2KI.9.9	I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.’ ” Then he opened the door and ran.
2KI.9.11	When Jehu went out to his fellow officers, one of them asked him, “Is everything all right? Why did this maniac come to you?”
2KI.9.11	“You know the man and the sort of things he says,” Jehu replied.
2KI.9.12	“That’s not true!” they said. “Tell us.”
2KI.9.12	Jehu said, “Here is what he told me: ‘This is what the 
2KI.9.13	They quickly took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, “Jehu is king!”
2KI.9.14	So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram, 
2KI.9.15	but King Joram
2KI.9.16	Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.
2KI.9.17	When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s troops approaching, he called out, “I see some troops coming.”
2KI.9.17	“Get a horseman,” Joram ordered. “Send him to meet them and ask, ‘Do you come in peace?’ ”
2KI.9.18	The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, “This is what the king says: ‘Do you come in peace?’ ”
2KI.9.18	“What do you have to do with peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.”
2KI.9.18	The lookout reported, “The messenger has reached them, but he isn’t coming back.”
2KI.9.19	So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said, “This is what the king says: ‘Do you come in peace?’ ”
2KI.9.19	Jehu replied, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me.”
2KI.9.20	The lookout reported, “He has reached them, but he isn’t coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi—he drives like a maniac.”
2KI.9.21	“Hitch up my chariot,” Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. 
2KI.9.22	When Joram saw Jehu he asked, “Have you come in peace, Jehu?”
2KI.9.22	“How can there be peace,” Jehu replied, “as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?”
2KI.9.23	Joram turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!”
2KI.9.24	Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot. 
2KI.9.25	Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer, “Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the 
2KI.9.26	‘Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, declares the 
2KI.9.27	When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to Beth Haggan.
2KI.9.28	His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in the City of David. 
2KI.9.29	(In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of Judah.)
2KI.9.30	Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she put on eye makeup, arranged her hair and looked out of a window. 
2KI.9.31	As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, “Have you come in peace, you Zimri, you murderer of your master?”
2KI.9.32	He looked up at the window and called out, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked down at him. 
2KI.9.33	“Throw her down!” Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot.
2KI.9.34	Jehu went in and ate and drank. “Take care of that cursed woman,” he said, “and bury her, for she was a king’s daughter.” 
2KI.9.35	But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her hands. 
2KI.9.36	They went back and told Jehu, who said, “This is the word of the 
2KI.9.37	Jezebel’s body will be like dung on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say, ‘This is Jezebel.’ ”
2KI.10.1	Now there were in Samaria seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel,
2KI.10.2	“You have your master’s sons with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons. Now as soon as this letter reaches you, 
2KI.10.3	choose the best and most worthy of your master’s sons and set him on his father’s throne. Then fight for your master’s house.”
2KI.10.4	But they were terrified and said, “If two kings could not resist him, how can we?”
2KI.10.5	So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: “We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best.”
2KI.10.6	Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, “If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master’s sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.”
2KI.10.6	Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them. 
2KI.10.7	When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the princes.”
2KI.10.8	Then Jehu ordered, “Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning.”
2KI.10.9	The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these? 
2KI.10.10	Know, then, that not a word the 
2KI.10.11	So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor.
2KI.10.12	Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds, 
2KI.10.13	he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, “Who are you?”
2KI.10.13	They said, “We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother.”
2KI.10.14	“Take them alive!” he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked—forty-two of them. He left no survivor.
2KI.10.15	After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Rekab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, “Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?”
2KI.10.15	“I am,” Jehonadab answered.
2KI.10.15	“If so,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.” So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot. 
2KI.10.16	Jehu said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the 
2KI.10.17	When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab’s family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the 
2KI.10.18	Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much. 
2KI.10.19	Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live.” But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal.
2KI.10.20	Jehu said, “Call an assembly in honor of Baal.” So they proclaimed it. 
2KI.10.21	Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other. 
2KI.10.22	And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, “Bring robes for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out robes for them.
2KI.10.23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look around and see that no one who serves the 
2KI.10.24	So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: “If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life.”
2KI.10.25	As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: “Go in and kill them; let no one escape.” So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal. 
2KI.10.26	They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it. 
2KI.10.27	They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal, and people have used it for a latrine to this day.
2KI.10.28	So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel. 
2KI.10.29	However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit—the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.
2KI.10.30	The 
2KI.10.31	Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the 
2KI.10.32	In those days the 
2KI.10.33	east of the Jordan in all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon Gorge through Gilead to Bashan.
2KI.10.34	As for the other events of Jehu’s reign, all he did, and all his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
2KI.10.35	Jehu rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son succeeded him as king. 
2KI.10.36	The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2KI.11.1	When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family. 
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram
2KI.11.3	He remained hidden with his nurse at the temple of the 
2KI.11.4	In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred, the Carites and the guards and had them brought to him at the temple of the 
2KI.11.5	He commanded them, saying, “This is what you are to do: You who are in the three companies that are going on duty on the Sabbath—a third of you guarding the royal palace, 
2KI.11.6	a third at the Sur Gate, and a third at the gate behind the guard, who take turns guarding the temple— 
2KI.11.7	and you who are in the other two companies that normally go off Sabbath duty are all to guard the temple for the king. 
2KI.11.8	Station yourselves around the king, each of you with weapon in hand. Anyone who approaches your ranks
2KI.11.9	The commanders of units of a hundred did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men—those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty—and came to Jehoiada the priest. 
2KI.11.10	Then he gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of the 
2KI.11.11	The guards, each with weapon in hand, stationed themselves around the king—near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
2KI.11.12	Jehoiada brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him; he presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him, and the people clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!”
2KI.11.13	When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people, she went to the people at the temple of the 
2KI.11.14	She looked and there was the king, standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes and called out, “Treason! Treason!”
2KI.11.15	Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops: “Bring her out between the ranks
2KI.11.16	So they seized her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds, and there she was put to death.
2KI.11.17	Jehoiada then made a covenant between the 
2KI.11.18	All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols to pieces and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
2KI.11.18	Then Jehoiada the priest posted guards at the temple of the 
2KI.11.19	He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards and all the people of the land, and together they brought the king down from the temple of the 
2KI.11.20	All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was calm, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the palace.
2KI.11.21	Joash
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash
2KI.12.2	Joash did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.12.3	The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
2KI.12.4	Joash said to the priests, “Collect all the money that is brought as sacred offerings to the temple of the 
2KI.12.5	Let every priest receive the money from one of the treasurers, then use it to repair whatever damage is found in the temple.”
2KI.12.6	But by the twenty-third year of King Joash the priests still had not repaired the temple. 
2KI.12.7	Therefore King Joash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and asked them, “Why aren’t you repairing the damage done to the temple? Take no more money from your treasurers, but hand it over for repairing the temple.” 
2KI.12.8	The priests agreed that they would not collect any more money from the people and that they would not repair the temple themselves.
2KI.12.9	Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the temple of the 
2KI.12.10	Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the royal secretary and the high priest came, counted the money that had been brought into the temple of the 
2KI.12.11	When the amount had been determined, they gave the money to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. With it they paid those who worked on the temple of the 
2KI.12.12	the masons and stonecutters. They purchased timber and blocks of dressed stone for the repair of the temple of the 
2KI.12.13	The money brought into the temple was not spent for making silver basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets or any other articles of gold or silver for the temple of the 
2KI.12.14	it was paid to the workers, who used it to repair the temple. 
2KI.12.15	They did not require an accounting from those to whom they gave the money to pay the workers, because they acted with complete honesty. 
2KI.12.16	The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings
2KI.12.17	About this time Hazael king of Aram went up and attacked Gath and captured it. Then he turned to attack Jerusalem. 
2KI.12.18	But Joash king of Judah took all the sacred objects dedicated by his predecessors—Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah—and the gifts he himself had dedicated and all the gold found in the treasuries of the temple of the 
2KI.12.19	As for the other events of the reign of Joash, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.12.20	His officials conspired against him and assassinated him at Beth Millo, on the road down to Silla. 
2KI.12.21	The officials who murdered him were Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer. He died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.13.1	In the twenty-third year of Joash son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years. 
2KI.13.2	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.13.3	So the 
2KI.13.4	Then Jehoahaz sought the 
2KI.13.5	The 
2KI.13.6	But they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit; they continued in them. Also, the Asherah pole
2KI.13.7	Nothing had been left of the army of Jehoahaz except fifty horsemen, ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers, for the king of Aram had destroyed the rest and made them like the dust at threshing time.
2KI.13.8	As for the other events of the reign of Jehoahaz, all he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.9	Jehoahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoash
2KI.13.10	In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years. 
2KI.13.11	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.13.12	As for the other events of the reign of Jehoash, all he did and his achievements, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.13	Jehoash rested with his ancestors, and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2KI.13.14	Now Elisha had been suffering from the illness from which he died. Jehoash king of Israel went down to see him and wept over him. “My father! My father!” he cried. “The chariots and horsemen of Israel!”
2KI.13.15	Elisha said, “Get a bow and some arrows,” and he did so. 
2KI.13.16	“Take the bow in your hands,” he said to the king of Israel. When he had taken it, Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands.
2KI.13.17	“Open the east window,” he said, and he opened it. “Shoot!” Elisha said, and he shot. “The 
2KI.13.18	Then he said, “Take the arrows,” and the king took them. Elisha told him, “Strike the ground.” He struck it three times and stopped. 
2KI.13.19	The man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck the ground five or six times; then you would have defeated Aram and completely destroyed it. But now you will defeat it only three times.”
2KI.13.20	Elisha died and was buried.
2KI.13.20	Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring. 
2KI.13.21	Once while some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders; so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. When the body touched Elisha’s bones, the man came to life and stood up on his feet.
2KI.13.22	Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz. 
2KI.13.23	But the 
2KI.13.24	Hazael king of Aram died, and Ben-Hadad his son succeeded him as king. 
2KI.13.25	Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz recaptured from Ben-Hadad son of Hazael the towns he had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz. Three times Jehoash defeated him, and so he recovered the Israelite towns.
2KI.14.1	In the second year of Jehoash
2KI.14.2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem. 
2KI.14.3	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.14.4	The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
2KI.14.5	After the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king. 
2KI.14.6	Yet he did not put the children of the assassins to death, in accordance with what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses where the 
2KI.14.7	He was the one who defeated ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela in battle, calling it Joktheel, the name it has to this day.
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, with the challenge: “Come, let us face each other in battle.”
2KI.14.9	But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot. 
2KI.14.10	You have indeed defeated Edom and now you are arrogant. Glory in your victory, but stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?”
2KI.14.11	Amaziah, however, would not listen, so Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah. 
2KI.14.12	Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home. 
2KI.14.13	Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section about four hundred cubits long.
2KI.14.14	He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of the 
2KI.14.15	As for the other events of the reign of Jehoash, what he did and his achievements, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.14.16	Jehoash rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.14.17	Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. 
2KI.14.18	As for the other events of Amaziah’s reign, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
2KI.14.19	They conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there. 
2KI.14.20	He was brought back by horse and was buried in Jerusalem with his ancestors, in the City of David.
2KI.14.21	Then all the people of Judah took Azariah,
2KI.14.22	He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his ancestors.
2KI.14.23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel became king in Samaria, and he reigned forty-one years. 
2KI.14.24	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.14.25	He was the one who restored the boundaries of Israel from Lebo Hamath to the Dead Sea,
2KI.14.26	The 
2KI.14.27	And since the 
2KI.14.28	As for the other events of Jeroboam’s reign, all he did, and his military achievements, including how he recovered for Israel both Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.14.29	Jeroboam rested with his ancestors, the kings of Israel. And Zechariah his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.15.1	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah
2KI.15.2	He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jekoliah; she was from Jerusalem. 
2KI.15.3	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.15.4	The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
2KI.15.5	The 
2KI.15.6	As for the other events of Azariah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.7	Azariah rested with his ancestors and was buried near them in the City of David. And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.15.8	In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned six months. 
2KI.15.9	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.15.10	Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah. He attacked him in front of the people,
2KI.15.11	The other events of Zechariah’s reign are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.12	So the word of the 
2KI.15.13	Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned in Samaria one month. 
2KI.15.14	Then Menahem son of Gadi went from Tirzah up to Samaria. He attacked Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria, assassinated him and succeeded him as king.
2KI.15.15	The other events of Shallum’s reign, and the conspiracy he led, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.16	At that time Menahem, starting out from Tirzah, attacked Tiphsah and everyone in the city and its vicinity, because they refused to open their gates. He sacked Tiphsah and ripped open all the pregnant women.
2KI.15.17	In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria ten years. 
2KI.15.18	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.15.19	Then Pul
2KI.15.20	Menahem exacted this money from Israel. Every wealthy person had to contribute fifty shekels
2KI.15.21	As for the other events of Menahem’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.15.22	Menahem rested with his ancestors. And Pekahiah his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.15.23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned two years. 
2KI.15.24	Pekahiah did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.15.25	One of his chief officers, Pekah son of Remaliah, conspired against him. Taking fifty men of Gilead with him, he assassinated Pekahiah, along with Argob and Arieh, in the citadel of the royal palace at Samaria. So Pekah killed Pekahiah and succeeded him as king.
2KI.15.26	The other events of Pekahiah’s reign, and all he did, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.27	In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twenty years. 
2KI.15.28	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.15.29	In the time of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon, Abel Beth Maakah, Janoah, Kedesh and Hazor. He took Gilead and Galilee, including all the land of Naphtali, and deported the people to Assyria. 
2KI.15.30	Then Hoshea son of Elah conspired against Pekah son of Remaliah. He attacked and assassinated him, and then succeeded him as king in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah.
2KI.15.31	As for the other events of Pekah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
2KI.15.32	In the second year of Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham son of Uzziah king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.15.33	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok. 
2KI.15.34	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.15.35	The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the 
2KI.15.36	As for the other events of Jotham’s reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.37	(In those days the 
2KI.15.38	Jotham rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David, the city of his father. And Ahaz his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.16.1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.16.2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.16.3	He followed the ways of the kings of Israel and even sacrificed his son in the fire, engaging in the detestable practices of the nations the 
2KI.16.4	He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.
2KI.16.5	Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem and besieged Ahaz, but they could not overpower him. 
2KI.16.6	At that time, Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram by driving out the people of Judah. Edomites then moved into Elath and have lived there to this day.
2KI.16.7	Ahaz sent messengers to say to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, “I am your servant and vassal. Come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Aram and of the king of Israel, who are attacking me.” 
2KI.16.8	And Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the temple of the 
2KI.16.9	The king of Assyria complied by attacking Damascus and capturing it. He deported its inhabitants to Kir and put Rezin to death.
2KI.16.10	Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria. He saw an altar in Damascus and sent to Uriah the priest a sketch of the altar, with detailed plans for its construction. 
2KI.16.11	So Uriah the priest built an altar in accordance with all the plans that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus and finished it before King Ahaz returned. 
2KI.16.12	When the king came back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and presented offerings
2KI.16.13	He offered up his burnt offering and grain offering, poured out his drink offering, and splashed the blood of his fellowship offerings against the altar. 
2KI.16.14	As for the bronze altar that stood before the 
2KI.16.15	King Ahaz then gave these orders to Uriah the priest: “On the large new altar, offer the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering, the king’s burnt offering and his grain offering, and the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their grain offering and their drink offering. Splash against this altar the blood of all the burnt offerings and sacrifices. But I will use the bronze altar for seeking guidance.” 
2KI.16.16	And Uriah the priest did just as King Ahaz had ordered.
2KI.16.17	King Ahaz cut off the side panels and removed the basins from the movable stands. He removed the Sea from the bronze bulls that supported it and set it on a stone base. 
2KI.16.18	He took away the Sabbath canopy
2KI.16.19	As for the other events of the reign of Ahaz, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.16.20	Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years. 
2KI.17.2	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.17.3	Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up to attack Hoshea, who had been Shalmaneser’s vassal and had paid him tribute. 
2KI.17.4	But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was a traitor, for he had sent envoys to So
2KI.17.5	The king of Assyria invaded the entire land, marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years. 
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.
2KI.17.7	All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the 
2KI.17.8	and followed the practices of the nations the 
2KI.17.9	The Israelites secretly did things against the 
2KI.17.10	They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree. 
2KI.17.11	At every high place they burned incense, as the nations whom the 
2KI.17.12	They worshiped idols, though the 
2KI.17.13	The 
2KI.17.14	But they would not listen and were as stiff-necked as their ancestors, who did not trust in the 
2KI.17.15	They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their ancestors and the statutes he had warned them to keep. They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the nations around them although the 
2KI.17.16	They forsook all the commands of the 
2KI.17.17	They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire. They practiced divination and sought omens and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.17.18	So the 
2KI.17.19	and even Judah did not keep the commands of the 
2KI.17.20	Therefore the 
2KI.17.21	When he tore Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the 
2KI.17.22	The Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them 
2KI.17.23	until the 
2KI.17.24	The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Kuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took over Samaria and lived in its towns. 
2KI.17.25	When they first lived there, they did not worship the 
2KI.17.26	It was reported to the king of Assyria: “The people you deported and resettled in the towns of Samaria do not know what the god of that country requires. He has sent lions among them, which are killing them off, because the people do not know what he requires.”
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria gave this order: “Have one of the priests you took captive from Samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires.” 
2KI.17.28	So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the 
2KI.17.29	Nevertheless, each national group made its own gods in the several towns where they settled, and set them up in the shrines the people of Samaria had made at the high places. 
2KI.17.30	The people from Babylon made Sukkoth Benoth, those from Kuthah made Nergal, and those from Hamath made Ashima; 
2KI.17.31	the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelek and Anammelek, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
2KI.17.32	They worshiped the 
2KI.17.33	They worshiped the 
2KI.17.34	To this day they persist in their former practices. They neither worship the

2KI.17.37	You must always be careful to keep the decrees and regulations, the laws and commands he wrote for you. Do not worship other gods. 
2KI.17.38	Do not forget the covenant I have made with you, and do not worship other gods. 
2KI.17.39	Rather, worship the

2KI.17.41	Even while these people were worshiping the 
2KI.18.1	In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.18.2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah
2KI.18.3	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (It was called Nehushtan.
2KI.18.5	Hezekiah trusted in the 
2KI.18.6	He held fast to the 
2KI.18.7	And the 
2KI.18.8	From watchtower to fortified city, he defeated the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory.
2KI.18.9	In King Hezekiah’s fourth year, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and laid siege to it. 
2KI.18.10	At the end of three years the Assyrians took it. So Samaria was captured in Hezekiah’s sixth year, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel. 
2KI.18.11	The king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in towns of the Medes. 
2KI.18.12	This happened because they had not obeyed the 
2KI.18.13	In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
2KI.18.14	So Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish: “I have done wrong. Withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand of me.” The king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents
2KI.18.15	So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the temple of the 
2KI.18.16	At this time Hezekiah king of Judah stripped off the gold with which he had covered the doors and doorposts of the temple of the 
2KI.18.17	The king of Assyria sent his supreme commander, his chief officer and his field commander with a large army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They came up to Jerusalem and stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman’s Field. 
2KI.18.18	They called for the king; and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to them.
2KI.18.19	The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah:
2KI.18.19	“ ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours? 
2KI.18.20	You say you have the counsel and the might for war—but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? 
2KI.18.21	Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him. 
2KI.18.22	But if you say to me, “We are depending on the 
2KI.18.23	“ ‘Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them! 
2KI.18.24	How can you repulse one officer of the least of my master’s officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen
2KI.18.25	Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this place without word from the 
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”
2KI.18.27	But the commander replied, “Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?”
2KI.18.28	Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! 
2KI.18.29	This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand. 
2KI.18.30	Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the 
2KI.18.31	“Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern, 
2KI.18.32	until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey. Choose life and not death!
2KI.18.32	“Do not listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, ‘The 
2KI.18.33	Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand? 
2KI.18.35	Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the 
2KI.18.36	But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, “Do not answer him.”
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.
2KI.19.1	When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the 
2KI.19.2	He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
2KI.19.3	They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the moment of birth and there is no strength to deliver them. 
2KI.19.4	It may be that the 
2KI.19.5	When King Hezekiah’s officials came to Isaiah, 
2KI.19.6	Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘This is what the 
2KI.19.7	Listen! When he hears a certain report, I will make him want to return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.’ ”
2KI.19.8	When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
2KI.19.9	Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the king of Cush,
2KI.19.10	“Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.’ 
2KI.19.11	Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered? 
2KI.19.12	Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver them—the gods of Gozan, Harran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar? 
2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath or the king of Arpad? Where are the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah?”
2KI.19.14	Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the 
2KI.19.15	And Hezekiah prayed to the 
2KI.19.16	Give ear, 
2KI.19.17	“It is true, 
2KI.19.18	They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands. 
2KI.19.19	Now, 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the

2KI.19.22	Against whom have you raised your voice
2KI.19.22	and lifted your eyes in pride?
2KI.19.22	Against the Holy One of Israel!
2KI.19.23	By your messengers
2KI.19.23	you have ridiculed the Lord.
2KI.19.23	And you have said,
2KI.19.23	“With my many chariots

2KI.19.23	the utmost heights of Lebanon.

2KI.19.23	I have reached its remotest parts,
2KI.19.23	the finest of its forests.
2KI.19.24	I have dug wells in foreign lands
2KI.19.24	and drunk the water there.

2KI.19.25	that you have turned fortified cities
2KI.19.25	into piles of stone.
2KI.19.26	Their people, drained of power,
2KI.19.26	are dismayed and put to shame.
2KI.19.26	They are like plants in the field,
2KI.19.26	like tender green shoots,

2KI.19.26	scorched before it grows up.
2KI.19.27	“ ‘But I know where you are
2KI.19.27	and when you come and go
2KI.19.27	and how you rage against me.
2KI.19.28	Because you rage against me
2KI.19.28	and because your insolence has reached my ears,
2KI.19.28	I will put my hook in your nose
2KI.19.28	and my bit in your mouth,
2KI.19.28	and I will make you return
2KI.19.28	by the way you came.’
2KI.19.29	“This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah:
2KI.19.29	“This year you will eat what grows by itself,
2KI.19.29	and the second year what springs from that.
2KI.19.29	But in the third year sow and reap,
2KI.19.29	plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
2KI.19.30	Once more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah
2KI.19.30	will take root below and bear fruit above.
2KI.19.31	For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant,
2KI.19.31	and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors.

2KI.19.32	or shoot an arrow here.
2KI.19.32	He will not come before it with shield
2KI.19.32	or build a siege ramp against it.
2KI.19.33	By the way that he came he will return;
2KI.19.33	he will not enter this city,
2KI.19.33	declares the 
2KI.19.34	I will defend this city and save it,
2KI.19.34	for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.’ ”
2KI.19.35	That night the angel of the 
2KI.19.36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
2KI.19.37	One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok, his sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.20.1	In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, “This is what the 
2KI.20.2	Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the 
2KI.20.3	“Remember, 
2KI.20.4	Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the 
2KI.20.5	“Go back and tell Hezekiah, the ruler of my people, ‘This is what the 
2KI.20.6	I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.’ ”
2KI.20.7	Then Isaiah said, “Prepare a poultice of figs.” They did so and applied it to the boil, and he recovered.
2KI.20.8	Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the 
2KI.20.9	Isaiah answered, “This is the 
2KI.20.10	“It is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps,” said Hezekiah. “Rather, have it go back ten steps.”
2KI.20.11	Then the prophet Isaiah called on the 
2KI.20.12	At that time Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of Hezekiah’s illness. 
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah received the envoys and showed them all that was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices and the fine olive oil—his armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did those men say, and where did they come from?”
2KI.20.14	“From a distant land,” Hezekiah replied. “They came from Babylon.”
2KI.20.15	The prophet asked, “What did they see in your palace?”
2KI.20.15	“They saw everything in my palace,” Hezekiah said. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.”
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the 
2KI.20.17	The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the 
2KI.20.18	And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
2KI.20.19	“The word of the 
2KI.20.20	As for the other events of Hezekiah’s reign, all his achievements and how he made the pool and the tunnel by which he brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.20.21	Hezekiah rested with his ancestors. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His mother’s name was Hephzibah. 
2KI.21.2	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.21.3	He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he also erected altars to Baal and made an Asherah pole, as Ahab king of Israel had done. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them. 
2KI.21.4	He built altars in the temple of the 
2KI.21.5	In the two courts of the temple of the 
2KI.21.6	He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced divination, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.21.7	He took the carved Asherah pole he had made and put it in the temple, of which the 
2KI.21.8	I will not again make the feet of the Israelites wander from the land I gave their ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them and will keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them.” 
2KI.21.9	But the people did not listen. Manasseh led them astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the 
2KI.21.10	The 
2KI.21.11	“Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable sins. He has done more evil than the Amorites who preceded him and has led Judah into sin with his idols. 
2KI.21.12	Therefore this is what the 
2KI.21.13	I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab. I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. 
2KI.21.14	I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hands of enemies. They will be looted and plundered by all their enemies; 
2KI.21.15	they have done evil in my eyes and have aroused my anger from the day their ancestors came out of Egypt until this day.”
2KI.21.16	Moreover, Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end—besides the sin that he had caused Judah to commit, so that they did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.21.17	As for the other events of Manasseh’s reign, and all he did, including the sin he committed, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.18	Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.21.21	He followed completely the ways of his father, worshiping the idols his father had worshiped, and bowing down to them. 
2KI.21.22	He forsook the 
2KI.21.23	Amon’s officials conspired against him and assassinated the king in his palace. 
2KI.21.24	Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.
2KI.21.25	As for the other events of Amon’s reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.26	He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. And Josiah his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath. 
2KI.22.2	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.22.3	In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the secretary, Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the temple of the 
2KI.22.4	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple of the 
2KI.22.5	Have them entrust it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. And have these men pay the workers who repair the temple of the 
2KI.22.6	the carpenters, the builders and the masons. Also have them purchase timber and dressed stone to repair the temple. 
2KI.22.7	But they need not account for the money entrusted to them, because they are honest in their dealings.”
2KI.22.8	Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the 
2KI.22.9	Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: “Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the 
2KI.22.10	Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
2KI.22.11	When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes. 
2KI.22.12	He gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Akbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king’s attendant: 
2KI.22.13	“Go and inquire of the 
2KI.22.14	Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Akbor, Shaphan and Asaiah went to speak to the prophet Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the New Quarter.
2KI.22.15	She said to them, “This is what the 
2KI.22.16	‘This is what the 
2KI.22.17	Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all the idols their hands have made,
2KI.22.18	Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the 
2KI.22.19	Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the 
2KI.22.20	Therefore I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.’ ”
2KI.22.20	So they took her answer back to the king.
2KI.23.1	Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.2	He went up to the temple of the 
2KI.23.3	The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the 
2KI.23.4	The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests next in rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the 
2KI.23.5	He did away with the idolatrous priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem—those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations and to all the starry hosts. 
2KI.23.6	He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the 
2KI.23.7	He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the temple of the 
2KI.23.8	Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He broke down the gateway at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua, the city governor, which was on the left of the city gate. 
2KI.23.9	Although the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of the 
2KI.23.10	He desecrated Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one could use it to sacrifice their son or daughter in the fire to Molek. 
2KI.23.11	He removed from the entrance to the temple of the 
2KI.23.12	He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the 
2KI.23.13	The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption—the ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the people of Ammon. 
2KI.23.14	Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones.
2KI.23.15	Even the altar at Bethel, the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin—even that altar and high place he demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole also. 
2KI.23.16	Then Josiah looked around, and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside, he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it, in accordance with the word of the 
2KI.23.17	The king asked, “What is that tombstone I see?”
2KI.23.17	The people of the city said, “It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it.”
2KI.23.18	“Leave it alone,” he said. “Don’t let anyone disturb his bones.” So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
2KI.23.19	Just as he had done at Bethel, Josiah removed all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria and that had aroused the 
2KI.23.20	Josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
2KI.23.21	The king gave this order to all the people: “Celebrate the Passover to the 
2KI.23.22	Neither in the days of the judges who led Israel nor in the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah had any such Passover been observed. 
2KI.23.23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the 
2KI.23.24	Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists, the household gods, the idols and all the other detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the 
2KI.23.25	Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the 
2KI.23.26	Nevertheless, the 
2KI.23.27	So the 
2KI.23.28	As for the other events of Josiah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
2KI.23.29	While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went up to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to meet him in battle, but Necho faced him and killed him at Megiddo. 
2KI.23.30	Josiah’s servants brought his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.23.33	Pharaoh Necho put him in chains at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents
2KI.23.34	Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt, and there he died. 
2KI.23.35	Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Necho the silver and gold he demanded. In order to do so, he taxed the land and exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land according to their assessments.
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah. 
2KI.23.37	And he did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.24.1	During Jehoiakim’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded the land, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. But then he turned against Nebuchadnezzar and rebelled. 
2KI.24.2	The 
2KI.24.3	Surely these things happened to Judah according to the 
2KI.24.4	including the shedding of innocent blood. For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the 
2KI.24.5	As for the other events of Jehoiakim’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.24.6	Jehoiakim rested with his ancestors. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king.
2KI.24.7	The king of Egypt did not march out from his own country again, because the king of Babylon had taken all his territory, from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.24.10	At that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem and laid siege to it, 
2KI.24.11	and Nebuchadnezzar himself came up to the city while his officers were besieging it. 
2KI.24.12	Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his attendants, his nobles and his officials all surrendered to him.
2KI.24.12	In the eighth year of the reign of the king of Babylon, he took Jehoiachin prisoner. 
2KI.24.13	As the 
2KI.24.14	He carried all Jerusalem into exile: all the officers and fighting men, and all the skilled workers and artisans—a total of ten thousand. Only the poorest people of the land were left.
2KI.24.15	Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. He also took from Jerusalem to Babylon the king’s mother, his wives, his officials and the prominent people of the land. 
2KI.24.16	The king of Babylon also deported to Babylon the entire force of seven thousand fighting men, strong and fit for war, and a thousand skilled workers and artisans. 
2KI.24.17	He made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah.
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. 
2KI.24.19	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2KI.24.20	It was because of the 
2KI.24.20	Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2KI.25.1	So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. He encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it. 
2KI.25.2	The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
2KI.25.3	By the ninth day of the fourth
2KI.25.4	Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled at night through the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the Babylonians
2KI.25.5	but the Babylonian
2KI.25.6	and he was captured.
2KI.25.6	He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where sentence was pronounced on him. 
2KI.25.7	They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, an official of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.9	He set fire to the temple of the 
2KI.25.10	The whole Babylonian army under the commander of the imperial guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.11	Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with the rest of the populace and those who had deserted to the king of Babylon. 
2KI.25.12	But the commander left behind some of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
2KI.25.13	The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the 
2KI.25.14	They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service. 
2KI.25.15	The commander of the imperial guard took away the censers and sprinkling bowls—all that were made of pure gold or silver.
2KI.25.16	The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the movable stands, which Solomon had made for the temple of the 
2KI.25.17	Each pillar was eighteen cubits
2KI.25.18	The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers. 
2KI.25.19	Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and five royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land and sixty of the conscripts who were found in the city. 
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed.
2KI.25.21	So Judah went into captivity, away from her land.
2KI.25.22	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to be over the people he had left behind in Judah. 
2KI.25.23	When all the army officers and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maakathite, and their men. 
2KI.25.24	Gedaliah took an oath to reassure them and their men. “Do not be afraid of the Babylonian officials,” he said. “Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.”
2KI.25.25	In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood, came with ten men and assassinated Gedaliah and also the men of Judah and the Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah. 
2KI.25.26	At this, all the people from the least to the greatest, together with the army officers, fled to Egypt for fear of the Babylonians.
2KI.25.27	In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison. He did this on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month. 
2KI.25.28	He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 
2KI.25.29	So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king’s table. 
2KI.25.30	Day by day the king gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived.

1CH.5.18	The Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 men ready for military service—able-bodied men who could handle shield and sword, who could use a bow, and who were trained for battle. 
1CH.5.19	They waged war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish and Nodab. 
1CH.5.20	They were helped in fighting them, and God delivered the Hagrites and all their allies into their hands, because they cried out to him during the battle. He answered their prayers, because they trusted in him. 
1CH.5.21	They seized the livestock of the Hagrites—fifty thousand camels, two hundred fifty thousand sheep and two thousand donkeys. They also took one hundred thousand people captive, 
1CH.5.22	and many others fell slain, because the battle was God’s. And they occupied the land until the exile.
1CH.5.23	The people of the half-tribe of Manasseh were numerous; they settled in the land from Bashan to Baal Hermon, that is, to Senir (Mount Hermon).
1CH.5.24	These were the heads of their families: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah and Jahdiel. They were brave warriors, famous men, and heads of their families. 
1CH.5.25	But they were unfaithful to the God of their ancestors and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them. 
1CH.5.26	So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (that is, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria), who took the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile. He took them to Halah, Habor, Hara and the river of Gozan, where they are to this day.

1CH.11.5	said to David, “You will not get in here.” Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David.
1CH.11.6	David had said, “Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander in chief.” Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.
1CH.11.7	David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David. 
1CH.11.8	He built up the city around it, from the terraces
1CH.11.9	And David became more and more powerful, because the 
1CH.11.10	These were the chiefs of David’s mighty warriors—they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the 
1CH.11.11	this is the list of David’s mighty warriors:
1CH.11.11	Jashobeam,
1CH.11.12	Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty warriors. 
1CH.11.13	He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines. 
1CH.11.14	But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the 
1CH.11.15	Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.11.16	At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. 
1CH.11.17	David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” 
1CH.11.18	So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the 
1CH.11.19	“God forbid that I should do this!” he said. “Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?” Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it.
1CH.11.19	Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors.
1CH.11.20	Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three. 
1CH.11.21	He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.
1CH.11.22	Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. 
1CH.11.23	And he struck down an Egyptian who was five cubits
1CH.11.24	Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors. 
1CH.11.25	He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
1CH.11.26	The mighty warriors were:
1CH.11.26	Asahel the brother of Joab,
1CH.11.26	Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,

1CH.11.33	Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
1CH.11.34	the sons of Hashem the Gizonite,
1CH.11.34	Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
1CH.11.35	Ahiam son of Sakar the Hararite,
1CH.11.35	Eliphal son of Ur,
1CH.11.36	Hepher the Mekerathite,
1CH.11.36	Ahijah the Pelonite,
1CH.11.37	Hezro the Carmelite,
1CH.11.37	Naarai son of Ezbai,
1CH.11.38	Joel the brother of Nathan,
1CH.11.38	Mibhar son of Hagri,
1CH.11.39	Zelek the Ammonite,
1CH.11.39	Naharai the Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
1CH.11.40	Ira the Ithrite,
1CH.11.40	Gareb the Ithrite,
1CH.11.41	Uriah the Hittite,
1CH.11.41	Zabad son of Ahlai,
1CH.11.42	Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, who was chief of the Reubenites, and the thirty with him,
1CH.11.43	Hanan son of Maakah,
1CH.11.43	Joshaphat the Mithnite,
1CH.11.44	Uzzia the Ashterathite,
1CH.11.44	Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
1CH.11.45	Jediael son of Shimri,
1CH.11.45	his brother Joha the Tizite,
1CH.11.46	Eliel the Mahavite,
1CH.11.46	Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam,
1CH.11.46	Ithmah the Moabite,
1CH.11.47	Eliel, Obed and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
1CH.12.1	These were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the warriors who helped him in battle; 
1CH.12.2	they were armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones right-handed or left-handed; they were relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin):
1CH.12.3	Ahiezer their chief and Joash the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Berakah, Jehu the Anathothite, 
1CH.12.4	and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty warrior among the Thirty, who was a leader of the Thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite,
1CH.12.5	Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah and Shephatiah the Haruphite; 
1CH.12.6	Elkanah, Ishiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam the Korahites; 
1CH.12.7	and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
1CH.12.8	Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the wilderness. They were brave warriors, ready for battle and able to handle the shield and spear. Their faces were the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles in the mountains.
1CH.12.9	Ezer was the chief,
1CH.12.9	Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,
1CH.12.10	Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
1CH.12.11	Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
1CH.12.12	Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
1CH.12.13	Jeremiah the tenth and Makbannai the eleventh.
1CH.12.14	These Gadites were army commanders; the least was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand. 
1CH.12.15	It was they who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight everyone living in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
1CH.12.16	Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold. 
1CH.12.17	David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come to me in peace to help me, I am ready for you to join me. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free from violence, may the God of our ancestors see it and judge you.”
1CH.12.18	Then the Spirit came on Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said:
1CH.12.18	“We are yours, David!
1CH.12.18	We are with you, son of Jesse!
1CH.12.18	Success, success to you,
1CH.12.18	and success to those who help you,
1CH.12.18	for your God will help you.”
1CH.12.18	So David received them and made them leaders of his raiding bands.
1CH.12.19	Some of the tribe of Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (He and his men did not help the Philistines because, after consultation, their rulers sent him away. They said, “It will cost us our heads if he deserts to his master Saul.”) 
1CH.12.20	When David went to Ziklag, these were the men of Manasseh who defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu and Zillethai, leaders of units of a thousand in Manasseh. 
1CH.12.21	They helped David against raiding bands, for all of them were brave warriors, and they were commanders in his army. 
1CH.12.22	Day after day men came to help David, until he had a great army, like the army of God.
1CH.12.23	These are the numbers of the men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him, as the 
1CH.12.24	from Judah, carrying shield and spear—6,800 armed for battle;
1CH.12.25	from Simeon, warriors ready for battle—7,100;
1CH.12.26	from Levi—4,600, 
1CH.12.27	including Jehoiada, leader of the family of Aaron, with 3,700 men, 
1CH.12.28	and Zadok, a brave young warrior, with 22 officers from his family;
1CH.12.29	from Benjamin, Saul’s tribe—3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to Saul’s house until then;
1CH.12.30	from Ephraim, brave warriors, famous in their own clans—20,800;
1CH.12.31	from half the tribe of Manasseh, designated by name to come and make David king—18,000;
1CH.12.32	from Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do—200 chiefs, with all their relatives under their command;
1CH.12.33	from Zebulun, experienced soldiers prepared for battle with every type of weapon, to help David with undivided loyalty—50,000;
1CH.12.34	from Naphtali—1,000 officers, together with 37,000 men carrying shields and spears;
1CH.12.35	from Dan, ready for battle—28,600;
1CH.12.36	from Asher, experienced soldiers prepared for battle—40,000;
1CH.12.37	and from east of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, armed with every type of weapon—120,000.
1CH.12.38	All these were fighting men who volunteered to serve in the ranks. They came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of the Israelites were also of one mind to make David king. 
1CH.12.39	The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, for their families had supplied provisions for them. 
1CH.12.40	Also, their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules and oxen. There were plentiful supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes, wine, olive oil, cattle and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.
1CH.13.1	David conferred with each of his officers, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 
1CH.13.2	He then said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you and if it is the will of the 
1CH.13.3	Let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we did not inquire of
1CH.13.4	The whole assembly agreed to do this, because it seemed right to all the people.
1CH.13.5	So David assembled all Israel, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim. 
1CH.13.6	David and all Israel went to Baalah of Judah (Kiriath Jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the 
1CH.13.7	They moved the ark of God from Abinadab’s house on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding it. 
1CH.13.8	David and all the Israelites were celebrating with all their might before God, with songs and with harps, lyres, timbrels, cymbals and trumpets.
1CH.13.9	When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled. 
1CH.13.10	The 
1CH.13.11	Then David was angry because the 
1CH.13.12	David was afraid of God that day and asked, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?” 
1CH.13.13	He did not take the ark to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. 
1CH.13.14	The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three months, and the 
1CH.14.1	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him. 
1CH.14.2	And David knew that the 
1CH.14.3	In Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went out to meet them. 
1CH.14.9	Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim; 
1CH.14.10	so David inquired of God: “Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hands?”
1CH.14.10	The 
1CH.14.11	So David and his men went up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, “As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand.” So that place was called Baal Perazim.
1CH.14.12	The Philistines had abandoned their gods there, and David gave orders to burn them in the fire.
1CH.14.13	Once more the Philistines raided the valley; 
1CH.14.14	so David inquired of God again, and God answered him, “Do not go directly after them, but circle around them and attack them in front of the poplar trees. 
1CH.14.15	As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the poplar trees, move out to battle, because that will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.” 
1CH.14.16	So David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army, all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
1CH.14.17	So David’s fame spread throughout every land, and the 
1CH.15.1	After David had constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. 
1CH.15.2	Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the 
1CH.15.3	David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.4	He called together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
1CH.15.5	From the descendants of Kohath,
1CH.15.5	Uriel the leader and 120 relatives;
1CH.15.6	from the descendants of Merari,
1CH.15.6	Asaiah the leader and 220 relatives;
1CH.15.7	from the descendants of Gershon,
1CH.15.7	Joel the leader and 130 relatives;
1CH.15.8	from the descendants of Elizaphan,
1CH.15.8	Shemaiah the leader and 200 relatives;
1CH.15.9	from the descendants of Hebron,
1CH.15.9	Eliel the leader and 80 relatives;
1CH.15.10	from the descendants of Uzziel,
1CH.15.10	Amminadab the leader and 112 relatives.
1CH.15.11	Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab the Levites. 
1CH.15.12	He said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families; you and your fellow Levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.13	It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that the 
1CH.15.14	So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves in order to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.15	And the Levites carried the ark of God with the poles on their shoulders, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the 
1CH.15.16	David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their fellow Levites as musicians to make a joyful sound with musical instruments: lyres, harps and cymbals.
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his relatives, Asaph son of Berekiah; and from their relatives the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah; 
1CH.15.18	and with them their relatives next in rank: Zechariah,
1CH.15.19	The musicians Heman, Asaph and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals; 
1CH.15.20	Zechariah, Jaaziel,
1CH.15.21	and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel and Azaziah were to play the harps, directing according to 
1CH.15.22	Kenaniah the head Levite was in charge of the singing; that was his responsibility because he was skillful at it.
1CH.15.23	Berekiah and Elkanah were to be doorkeepers for the ark. 
1CH.15.24	Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer the priests were to blow trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-Edom and Jehiah were also to be doorkeepers for the ark.
1CH.15.25	So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.26	Because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.27	Now David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and as were the musicians, and Kenaniah, who was in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod. 
1CH.15.28	So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.29	As the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.1	They brought the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and they presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God. 
1CH.16.2	After David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
1CH.16.3	Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each Israelite man and woman.
1CH.16.4	He appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph was the chief, and next to him in rank were Zechariah, then Jaaziel,
1CH.16.6	and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
1CH.16.7	That day David first appointed Asaph and his associates to give praise to the 
1CH.16.8	Give praise to the 
1CH.16.8	make known among the nations what he has done.
1CH.16.9	Sing to him, sing praise to him;
1CH.16.9	tell of all his wonderful acts.
1CH.16.10	Glory in his holy name;
1CH.16.10	let the hearts of those who seek the 
1CH.16.11	Look to the 
1CH.16.11	seek his face always.
1CH.16.12	Remember the wonders he has done,
1CH.16.12	his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,
1CH.16.13	you his servants, the descendants of Israel,
1CH.16.13	his chosen ones, the children of Jacob.
1CH.16.14	He is the 
1CH.16.14	his judgments are in all the earth.
1CH.16.15	He remembers
1CH.16.15	the promise he made, for a thousand generations,
1CH.16.16	the covenant he made with Abraham,
1CH.16.16	the oath he swore to Isaac.
1CH.16.17	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
1CH.16.17	to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
1CH.16.18	“To you I will give the land of Canaan
1CH.16.18	as the portion you will inherit.”
1CH.16.19	When they were but few in number,
1CH.16.19	few indeed, and strangers in it,
1CH.16.20	they
1CH.16.20	from one kingdom to another.
1CH.16.21	He allowed no one to oppress them;
1CH.16.21	for their sake he rebuked kings:
1CH.16.22	“Do not touch my anointed ones;
1CH.16.22	do my prophets no harm.”
1CH.16.23	Sing to the 
1CH.16.23	proclaim his salvation day after day.
1CH.16.24	Declare his glory among the nations,
1CH.16.24	his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
1CH.16.25	For great is the 
1CH.16.25	he is to be feared above all gods.
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the nations are idols,
1CH.16.26	but the 
1CH.16.27	Splendor and majesty are before him;
1CH.16.27	strength and joy are in his dwelling place.
1CH.16.28	Ascribe to the 
1CH.16.28	ascribe to the 
1CH.16.29	Ascribe to the 
1CH.16.29	bring an offering and come before him.
1CH.16.29	Worship the 
1CH.16.30	Tremble before him, all the earth!
1CH.16.30	The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad;
1CH.16.31	let them say among the nations, “The 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea resound, and all that is in it;
1CH.16.32	let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them!
1CH.16.33	Let the trees of the forest sing,
1CH.16.33	let them sing for joy before the 
1CH.16.33	for he comes to judge the earth.
1CH.16.34	Give thanks to the 
1CH.16.34	his love endures forever.
1CH.16.35	Cry out, “Save us, God our Savior;
1CH.16.35	gather us and deliver us from the nations,
1CH.16.35	that we may give thanks to your holy name,
1CH.16.35	and glory in your praise.”
1CH.16.36	Praise be to the 
1CH.16.36	from everlasting to everlasting.
1CH.16.36	Then all the people said “Amen” and “Praise the 
1CH.16.37	David left Asaph and his associates before the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.38	He also left Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight associates to minister with them. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were gatekeepers.
1CH.16.39	David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the 
1CH.16.40	to present burnt offerings to the 
1CH.16.41	With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.42	Heman and Jeduthun were responsible for the sounding of the trumpets and cymbals and for the playing of the other instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.
1CH.16.43	Then all the people left, each for their own home, and David returned home to bless his family.
1CH.17.1	After David was settled in his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.17.2	Nathan replied to David, “Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you.”
1CH.17.3	But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:
1CH.17.4	“Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the 
1CH.17.5	I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another. 
1CH.17.6	Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders
1CH.17.7	“Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the 
1CH.17.8	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men on earth. 
1CH.17.9	And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning 
1CH.17.10	and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies.
1CH.17.10	“ ‘I declare to you that the 
1CH.17.11	When your days are over and you go to be with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 
1CH.17.12	He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever. 
1CH.17.13	I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor. 
1CH.17.14	I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever.’ ”
1CH.17.15	Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.
1CH.17.16	Then King David went in and sat before the 
1CH.17.16	“Who am I, 
1CH.17.17	And as if this were not enough in your sight, my God, you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant. You, 
1CH.17.18	“What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant, 
1CH.17.19	. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises.
1CH.17.20	“There is no one like you, 
1CH.17.21	And who is like your people Israel—the one nation on earth whose God went out to redeem a people for himself, and to make a name for yourself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt? 
1CH.17.22	You made your people Israel your very own forever, and you, 
1CH.17.23	“And now, 
1CH.17.24	so that it will be established and that your name will be great forever. Then people will say, ‘The

1CH.17.27	Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, 
1CH.18.1	In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Gath and its surrounding villages from the control of the Philistines.
1CH.18.2	David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to him and brought him tribute.
1CH.18.3	Moreover, David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah, in the vicinity of Hamath, when he went to set up his monument at
1CH.18.4	David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
1CH.18.5	When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of them. 
1CH.18.6	He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and brought him tribute. The 
1CH.18.7	David took the gold shields carried by the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	From Tebah
1CH.18.9	When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 
1CH.18.10	he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold, of silver and of bronze.
1CH.18.11	King David dedicated these articles to the 
1CH.18.12	Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
1CH.18.13	He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The 
1CH.18.14	David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people. 
1CH.18.15	Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder; 
1CH.18.16	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelek
1CH.18.17	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief officials at the king’s side.
1CH.19.1	In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him as king. 
1CH.19.2	David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.
1CH.19.2	When David’s envoys came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him, 
1CH.19.3	the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Haven’t his envoys come to you only to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?” 
1CH.19.4	So Hanun seized David’s envoys, shaved them, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away.
1CH.19.5	When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back.”
1CH.19.6	When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents
1CH.19.7	They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maakah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.
1CH.19.8	On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men. 
1CH.19.9	The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
1CH.19.10	Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans. 
1CH.19.11	He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the Ammonites. 
1CH.19.12	Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you. 
1CH.19.13	Be strong, and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The 
1CH.19.14	Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
1CH.19.15	When the Ammonites realized that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophak the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.
1CH.19.17	When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him. 
1CH.19.18	But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophak the commander of their army.
1CH.19.19	When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him.
1CH.19.19	So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.
1CH.20.1	In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, Joab led out the armed forces. He laid waste the land of the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins. 
1CH.20.2	David took the crown from the head of their king
1CH.20.3	and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.20.4	In the course of time, war broke out with the Philistines, at Gezer. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaites, and the Philistines were subjugated.
1CH.20.5	In another battle with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver’s rod.
1CH.20.6	In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha. 
1CH.20.7	When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.
1CH.20.8	These were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.
1CH.21.1	Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel. 
1CH.21.2	So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are.”
1CH.21.3	But Joab replied, “May the 
1CH.21.4	The king’s word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.
1CH.21.6	But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king’s command was repulsive to him. 
1CH.21.7	This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.
1CH.21.8	Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.”
1CH.21.9	The 
1CH.21.10	“Go and tell David, ‘This is what the 
1CH.21.11	So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the 
1CH.21.12	three years of famine, three months of being swept away
1CH.21.13	David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the 
1CH.21.16	David looked up and saw the angel of the 
1CH.21.17	David said to God, “Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I, the shepherd,
1CH.21.18	Then the angel of the 
1CH.21.19	So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the 
1CH.21.20	While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves. 
1CH.21.21	Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.
1CH.21.22	David said to him, “Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the 
1CH.21.23	Araunah said to David, “Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this.”
1CH.21.24	But King David replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the 
1CH.21.25	So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels
1CH.21.26	David built an altar to the 
1CH.21.27	Then the 
1CH.21.28	At that time, when David saw that the 
1CH.21.29	The tabernacle of the 
1CH.21.30	But David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the 
1CH.22.1	Then David said, “The house of the 
1CH.22.2	So David gave orders to assemble the foreigners residing in Israel, and from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God. 
1CH.22.3	He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed. 
1CH.22.4	He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David.
1CH.22.5	David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the 
1CH.22.6	Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the 
1CH.22.7	David said to Solomon: “My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of the 
1CH.22.8	But this word of the 
1CH.22.9	But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon,
1CH.22.10	He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’
1CH.22.11	“Now, my son, the 
1CH.22.12	May the 
1CH.22.13	Then you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the 
1CH.22.14	“I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the 
1CH.22.15	You have many workers: stonecutters, masons and carpenters, as well as those skilled in every kind of work 
1CH.22.16	in gold and silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and the 
1CH.22.17	Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon. 
1CH.22.18	He said to them, “Is not the 
1CH.22.19	Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the 
1CH.23.1	When David was old and full of years, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
1CH.23.2	He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites. 
1CH.23.3	The Levites thirty years old or more were counted, and the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand. 
1CH.23.4	David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand are to be in charge of the work of the temple of the 
1CH.23.5	Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise the 
1CH.23.6	David separated the Levites into divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
1CH.23.7	Belonging to the Gershonites:
1CH.23.7	Ladan and Shimei.
1CH.23.8	The sons of Ladan:
1CH.23.8	Jehiel the first, Zetham and Joel—three in all.
1CH.23.9	The sons of Shimei:
1CH.23.9	Shelomoth, Haziel and Haran—three in all.
1CH.23.9	These were the heads of the families of Ladan.
1CH.23.10	And the sons of Shimei:
1CH.23.10	Jahath, Ziza,
1CH.23.10	These were the sons of Shimei—four in all.
1CH.23.11	Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; so they were counted as one family with one assignment.
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath:
1CH.23.12	Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel—four in all.
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram:
1CH.23.13	Aaron and Moses.
1CH.23.13	Aaron was set apart, he and his descendants forever, to consecrate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices before the 
1CH.23.14	The sons of Moses the man of God were counted as part of the tribe of Levi.
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses:
1CH.23.15	Gershom and Eliezer.
1CH.23.16	The descendants of Gershom:
1CH.23.16	Shubael was the first.
1CH.23.17	The descendants of Eliezer:
1CH.23.17	Rehabiah was the first.
1CH.23.17	Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
1CH.23.18	The sons of Izhar:
1CH.23.18	Shelomith was the first.
1CH.23.19	The sons of Hebron:
1CH.23.19	Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.
1CH.23.20	The sons of Uzziel:
1CH.23.20	Micah the first and Ishiah the second.
1CH.23.21	The sons of Merari:
1CH.23.21	Mahli and Mushi.
1CH.23.21	The sons of Mahli:
1CH.23.21	Eleazar and Kish.
1CH.23.22	Eleazar died without having sons: he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi:
1CH.23.23	Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth—three in all.
1CH.23.24	These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the 
1CH.23.25	For David had said, “Since the 
1CH.23.26	the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service.” 
1CH.23.27	According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more.
1CH.23.28	The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron’s descendants in the service of the temple of the 
1CH.23.29	They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the special flour for the grain offerings, the thin loaves made without yeast, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size. 
1CH.23.30	They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the 
1CH.23.31	and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the 
1CH.23.32	And so the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the tent of meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their relatives the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the temple of the 
1CH.24.1	These were the divisions of the descendants of Aaron:
1CH.24.1	The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
1CH.24.2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests. 
1CH.24.3	With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelek a descendant of Ithamar, David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of ministering. 
1CH.24.4	A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than among Ithamar’s, and they were divided accordingly: sixteen heads of families from Eleazar’s descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamar’s descendants. 
1CH.24.5	They divided them impartially by casting lots, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.
1CH.24.6	The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officials: Zadok the priest, Ahimelek son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar.
1CH.24.7	The first lot fell to Jehoiarib,
1CH.24.7	the second to Jedaiah,
1CH.24.8	the third to Harim,

1CH.24.18	the twenty-third to Delaiah
1CH.24.18	and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
1CH.24.19	This was their appointed order of ministering when they entered the temple of the 
1CH.24.20	As for the rest of the descendants of Levi:
1CH.24.20	from the sons of Amram: Shubael;
1CH.24.20	from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah.

1CH.24.26	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
1CH.24.26	The son of Jaaziah: Beno.
1CH.24.27	The sons of Merari:
1CH.24.27	from Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zakkur and Ibri.
1CH.24.28	From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
1CH.24.29	From Kish: the son of Kish:
1CH.24.29	Jerahmeel.
1CH.24.30	And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth.
1CH.24.30	These were the Levites, according to their families. 
1CH.24.31	They also cast lots, just as their relatives the descendants of Aaron did, in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelek, and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites. The families of the oldest brother were treated the same as those of the youngest.
1CH.25.1	David, together with the commanders of the army, set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun for the ministry of prophesying, accompanied by harps, lyres and cymbals. Here is the list of the men who performed this service:
1CH.25.2	From the sons of Asaph:

1CH.28.2	King David rose to his feet and said: “Listen to me, my fellow Israelites, my people. I had it in my heart to build a house as a place of rest for the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.28.3	But God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for my Name, because you are a warrior and have shed blood.’
1CH.28.4	“Yet the 
1CH.28.5	Of all my sons—and the 
1CH.28.6	He said to me: ‘Solomon your son is the one who will build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. 
1CH.28.7	I will establish his kingdom forever if he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws, as is being done at this time.’
1CH.28.8	“So now I charge you in the sight of all Israel and of the assembly of the 
1CH.28.9	“And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the 
1CH.28.10	Consider now, for the 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple, its buildings, its storerooms, its upper parts, its inner rooms and the place of atonement. 
1CH.28.12	He gave him the plans of all that the Spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the temple of the

1CH.28.19	“All this,” David said, “I have in writing as a result of the 
1CH.28.20	David also said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the 
1CH.28.21	The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the work on the temple of God, and every willing person skilled in any craft will help you in all the work. The officials and all the people will obey your every command.”
1CH.29.1	Then King David said to the whole assembly: “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great, because this palatial structure is not for man but for the 
1CH.29.2	With all my resources I have provided for the temple of my God—gold for the gold work, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise,
1CH.29.3	Besides, in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God, over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple: 
1CH.29.4	three thousand talents
1CH.29.5	for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now, who is willing to consecrate themselves to the 
1CH.29.6	Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave willingly. 
1CH.29.7	They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents
1CH.29.8	Anyone who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the 
1CH.29.9	The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the 
1CH.29.10	David praised the 
1CH.29.10	“Praise be to you, 
1CH.29.10	the God of our father Israel,
1CH.29.10	from everlasting to everlasting.
1CH.29.11	Yours, 
1CH.29.11	and the glory and the majesty and the splendor,
1CH.29.11	for everything in heaven and earth is yours.
1CH.29.11	Yours, 
1CH.29.11	you are exalted as head over all.
1CH.29.12	Wealth and honor come from you;
1CH.29.12	you are the ruler of all things.
1CH.29.12	In your hands are strength and power
1CH.29.12	to exalt and give strength to all.
1CH.29.13	Now, our God, we give you thanks,
1CH.29.13	and praise your glorious name.
1CH.29.14	“But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand. 
1CH.29.15	We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope. 
1CH.29.16	 our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you. 
1CH.29.17	I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things I have given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you. 
1CH.29.18	, the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep these desires and thoughts in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you. 
1CH.29.19	And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, statutes and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided.”
1CH.29.20	Then David said to the whole assembly, “Praise the 
1CH.29.21	The next day they made sacrifices to the 
1CH.29.22	They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the 
1CH.29.22	Then they acknowledged Solomon son of David as king a second time, anointing him before the 
1CH.29.23	So Solomon sat on the throne of the 
1CH.29.24	All the officers and warriors, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their submission to King Solomon.
1CH.29.25	The 
1CH.29.26	David son of Jesse was king over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	He ruled over Israel forty years—seven in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. 
1CH.29.28	He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him as king.
1CH.29.29	As for the events of King David’s reign, from beginning to end, they are written in the records of Samuel the seer, the records of Nathan the prophet and the records of Gad the seer, 
1CH.29.30	together with the details of his reign and power, and the circumstances that surrounded him and Israel and the kingdoms of all the other lands.
2CH.1.1	Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the 
2CH.1.2	Then Solomon spoke to all Israel—to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families— 
2CH.1.3	and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God’s tent of meeting was there, which Moses the 
2CH.1.4	Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.5	But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the 
2CH.1.6	Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the 
2CH.1.7	That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for whatever you want me to give you.”
2CH.1.8	Solomon answered God, “You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place. 
2CH.1.9	Now, 
2CH.1.10	Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?”
2CH.1.11	God said to Solomon, “Since this is your heart’s desire and you have not asked for wealth, possessions or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king, 
2CH.1.12	therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have.”
2CH.1.13	Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting. And he reigned over Israel.
2CH.1.14	Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses,
2CH.1.15	The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. 
2CH.1.16	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue
2CH.1.17	They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels
2CH.2.1	Solomon gave orders to build a temple for the Name of the 
2CH.2.2	He conscripted 70,000 men as carriers and 80,000 as stonecutters in the hills and 3,600 as foremen over them.
2CH.2.3	Solomon sent this message to Hiram
2CH.2.3	“Send me cedar logs as you did for my father David when you sent him cedar to build a palace to live in. 
2CH.2.4	Now I am about to build a temple for the Name of the 
2CH.2.5	“The temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods. 
2CH.2.6	But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?
2CH.2.7	“Send me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the art of engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled workers, whom my father David provided.
2CH.2.8	“Send me also cedar, juniper and algum
2CH.2.9	to provide me with plenty of lumber, because the temple I build must be large and magnificent. 
2CH.2.10	I will give your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, twenty thousand cors
2CH.2.11	Hiram king of Tyre replied by letter to Solomon:
2CH.2.11	“Because the 
2CH.2.12	And Hiram added:
2CH.2.12	“Praise be to the 
2CH.2.13	“I am sending you Huram-Abi, a man of great skill, 
2CH.2.14	whose mother was from Dan and whose father was from Tyre. He is trained to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, and with purple and blue and crimson yarn and fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds of engraving and can execute any design given to him. He will work with your skilled workers and with those of my lord, David your father.
2CH.2.15	“Now let my lord send his servants the wheat and barley and the olive oil and wine he promised, 
2CH.2.16	and we will cut all the logs from Lebanon that you need and will float them as rafts by sea down to Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem.”
2CH.2.17	Solomon took a census of all the foreigners residing in Israel, after the census his father David had taken; and they were found to be 153,600. 
2CH.2.18	He assigned 70,000 of them to be carriers and 80,000 to be stonecutters in the hills, with 3,600 foremen over them to keep the people working.
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the temple of the 
2CH.3.2	He began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
2CH.3.3	The foundation Solomon laid for building the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide
2CH.3.4	The portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits
2CH.3.4	He overlaid the inside with pure gold. 
2CH.3.5	He paneled the main hall with juniper and covered it with fine gold and decorated it with palm tree and chain designs. 
2CH.3.6	He adorned the temple with precious stones. And the gold he used was gold of Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	He overlaid the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls and doors of the temple with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.
2CH.3.8	He built the Most Holy Place, its length corresponding to the width of the temple—twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. He overlaid the inside with six hundred talents
2CH.3.9	The gold nails weighed fifty shekels.
2CH.3.10	For the Most Holy Place he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold. 
2CH.3.11	The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits
2CH.3.12	Similarly one wing of the second cherub was five cubits long and touched the other temple wall, and its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub. 
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main hall.
2CH.3.14	He made the curtain of blue, purple and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it.
2CH.3.15	For the front of the temple he made two pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits
2CH.3.16	He made interwoven chains
2CH.3.17	He erected the pillars in the front of the temple, one to the south and one to the north. The one to the south he named Jakin
2CH.4.1	He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.
2CH.4.2	He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits
2CH.4.3	Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled it—ten to a cubit.
2CH.4.4	The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. 
2CH.4.5	It was a handbreadth
2CH.4.6	He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing.
2CH.4.7	He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.
2CH.4.8	He made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls.
2CH.4.9	He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze. 
2CH.4.10	He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.
2CH.4.11	And Huram also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls.
2CH.4.11	So Huram finished the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of God:
2CH.4.12	the two pillars;
2CH.4.12	the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
2CH.4.12	the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
2CH.4.13	the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);
2CH.4.14	the stands with their basins;
2CH.4.15	the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;
2CH.4.16	the pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles.
2CH.4.16	All the objects that Huram-Abi made for King Solomon for the temple of the 
2CH.4.17	The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Sukkoth and Zarethan.
2CH.4.18	All these things that Solomon made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze could not be calculated.
2CH.4.19	Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in God’s temple:
2CH.4.19	the golden altar;
2CH.4.19	the tables on which was the bread of the Presence;
2CH.4.20	the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed;
2CH.4.21	the gold floral work and lamps and tongs (they were solid gold);
2CH.4.22	the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and the doors of the main hall.
2CH.5.1	When all the work Solomon had done for the temple of the 
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the 
2CH.5.3	And all the Israelites came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month.
2CH.5.4	When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark, 
2CH.5.5	and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The Levitical priests carried them up; 
2CH.5.6	and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.
2CH.5.7	The priests then brought the ark of the 
2CH.5.8	The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles. 
2CH.5.9	These poles were so long that their ends, extending from the ark, could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today. 
2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the 
2CH.5.11	The priests then withdrew from the Holy Place. All the priests who were there had consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions. 
2CH.5.12	All the Levites who were musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun and their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets. 
2CH.5.13	The trumpeters and musicians joined in unison to give praise and thanks to the 
2CH.5.13	“He is good;
2CH.5.13	his love endures forever.”
2CH.5.13	Then the temple of the

2CH.6.1	Then Solomon said, “The 
2CH.6.2	I have built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever.”
2CH.6.3	While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them. 
2CH.6.4	Then he said:
2CH.6.4	“Praise be to the 
2CH.6.5	‘Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel. 
2CH.6.6	But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.’
2CH.6.7	“My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the 
2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood—he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.’
2CH.6.10	“The 
2CH.6.11	There I have placed the ark, in which is the covenant of the 
2CH.6.12	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the 
2CH.6.13	Now he had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high,
2CH.6.14	He said:
2CH.6.14	“
2CH.6.15	You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it—as it is today.
2CH.6.16	“Now, 
2CH.6.17	And now, 
2CH.6.18	“But will God really dwell on earth with humans? The heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built! 
2CH.6.19	Yet, 
2CH.6.20	May your eyes be open toward this temple day and night, this place of which you said you would put your Name there. May you hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place. 
2CH.6.21	Hear the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.
2CH.6.22	“When anyone wrongs their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before your altar in this temple, 
2CH.6.23	then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty and bringing down on their heads what they have done, and vindicating the innocent by treating them in accordance with their innocence.
2CH.6.24	“When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you and when they turn back and give praise to your name, praying and making supplication before you in this temple, 
2CH.6.25	then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their ancestors.
2CH.6.26	“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them, 
2CH.6.27	then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.
2CH.6.28	“When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when enemies besiege them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come, 
2CH.6.29	and when a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people Israel—being aware of their afflictions and pains, and spreading out their hands toward this temple— 
2CH.6.30	then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive, and deal with everyone according to all they do, since you know their hearts (for you alone know the human heart), 
2CH.6.31	so that they will fear you and walk in obedience to you all the time they live in the land you gave our ancestors.
2CH.6.32	“As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when they come and pray toward this temple, 
2CH.6.33	then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.
2CH.6.34	“When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to you toward this city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name, 
2CH.6.35	then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
2CH.6.36	“When they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes them captive to a land far away or near; 
2CH.6.37	and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity and say, ‘We have sinned, we have done wrong and acted wickedly’; 
2CH.6.38	and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were taken, and pray toward the land you gave their ancestors, toward the city you have chosen and toward the temple I have built for your Name; 
2CH.6.39	then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their pleas, and uphold their cause. And forgive your people, who have sinned against you.
2CH.6.40	“Now, my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
2CH.6.41	“Now arise, 
2CH.6.41	you and the ark of your might.
2CH.6.41	May your priests, 
2CH.6.41	may your faithful people rejoice in your goodness.
2CH.6.42	Remember the great love promised to David your servant.”
2CH.7.1	When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the 
2CH.7.2	The priests could not enter the temple of the 
2CH.7.3	When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the 
2CH.7.3	“He is good;
2CH.7.3	his love endures forever.”
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the 
2CH.7.5	And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God. 
2CH.7.6	The priests took their positions, as did the Levites with the 
2CH.7.7	Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the 
2CH.7.8	So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. 
2CH.7.9	On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more. 
2CH.7.10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the 
2CH.7.11	When Solomon had finished the temple of the 
2CH.7.12	the 
2CH.7.12	“I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.
2CH.7.13	“When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people, 
2CH.7.14	if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land. 
2CH.7.15	Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place. 
2CH.7.16	I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my Name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
2CH.7.17	“As for you, if you walk before me faithfully as David your father did, and do all I command, and observe my decrees and laws, 
2CH.7.18	I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father when I said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor to rule over Israel.’
2CH.7.19	“But if you
2CH.7.20	then I will uproot Israel from my land, which I have given them, and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. I will make it a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples. 
2CH.7.21	This temple will become a heap of rubble. All
2CH.7.22	People will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the

2CH.8.2	Solomon rebuilt the villages that Hiram
2CH.8.3	Solomon then went to Hamath Zobah and captured it. 
2CH.8.4	He also built up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had built in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls and with gates and bars, 
2CH.8.6	as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and all the cities for his chariots and for his horses
2CH.8.7	There were still people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these people were not Israelites). 
2CH.8.8	Solomon conscripted the descendants of all these people remaining in the land—whom the Israelites had not destroyed—to serve as slave labor, as it is to this day. 
2CH.8.9	But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they were his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers. 
2CH.8.10	They were also King Solomon’s chief officials—two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men.
2CH.8.11	Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, for he said, “My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the 
2CH.8.12	On the altar of the 
2CH.8.13	according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for the Sabbaths, the New Moons and the three annual festivals—the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of Tabernacles. 
2CH.8.14	In keeping with the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties, and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day’s requirement. He also appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates, because this was what David the man of God had ordered. 
2CH.8.15	They did not deviate from the king’s commands to the priests or to the Levites in any matter, including that of the treasuries.
2CH.8.16	All Solomon’s work was carried out, from the day the foundation of the temple of the 
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the coast of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	And Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own men, sailors who knew the sea. These, with Solomon’s men, sailed to Ophir and brought back four hundred and fifty talents
2CH.9.1	When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. Arriving with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones—she came to Solomon and talked with him about all she had on her mind. 
2CH.9.2	Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her. 
2CH.9.3	When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, as well as the palace he had built, 
2CH.9.4	the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, the cupbearers in their robes and the burnt offerings he made at
2CH.9.5	She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true. 
2CH.9.6	But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard. 
2CH.9.7	How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! 
2CH.9.8	Praise be to the 
2CH.9.9	Then she gave the king 120 talents
2CH.9.10	(The servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon brought gold from Ophir; they also brought algumwood
2CH.9.11	The king used the algumwood to make steps for the temple of the 
2CH.9.12	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for; he gave her more than she had brought to him. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.
2CH.9.13	The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,
2CH.9.14	not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders. Also all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the territories brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2CH.9.15	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels
2CH.9.16	He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three hundred shekels
2CH.9.17	Then the king made a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them. 
2CH.9.19	Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom. 
2CH.9.20	All King Solomon’s goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon’s day. 
2CH.9.21	The king had a fleet of trading ships
2CH.9.22	King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth. 
2CH.9.23	All the kings of the earth sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart. 
2CH.9.24	Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift—articles of silver and gold, and robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules.
2CH.9.25	Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horses,
2CH.9.26	He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. 
2CH.9.27	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. 
2CH.9.28	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from all other countries.
2CH.9.29	As for the other events of Solomon’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat? 
2CH.9.30	Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
2CH.9.31	Then he rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
2CH.10.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt. 
2CH.10.3	So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him: 
2CH.10.4	“Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”
2CH.10.5	Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people went away.
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How would you advise me to answer these people?” he asked.
2CH.10.7	They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.”
2CH.10.8	But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. 
2CH.10.9	He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”
2CH.10.10	The young men who had grown up with him replied, “The people have said to you, ‘Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.’ Now tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. 
2CH.10.11	My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.’ ”
2CH.10.12	Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, “Come back to me in three days.” 
2CH.10.13	The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders, 
2CH.10.14	he followed the advice of the young men and said, “My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.” 
2CH.10.15	So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill the word the 
2CH.10.16	When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king:
2CH.10.16	“What share do we have in David,
2CH.10.16	what part in Jesse’s son?
2CH.10.16	To your tents, Israel!
2CH.10.16	Look after your own house, David!”
2CH.10.16	So all the Israelites went home. 
2CH.10.17	But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.
2CH.10.18	King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram,
2CH.10.19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
2CH.11.1	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered Judah and Benjamin—a hundred and eighty thousand able young men—to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam.
2CH.11.2	But this word of the 
2CH.11.3	“Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 
2CH.11.4	‘This is what the 
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built up towns for defense in Judah: 
2CH.11.6	Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth Zur, Soko, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	He strengthened their defenses and put commanders in them, with supplies of food, olive oil and wine. 
2CH.11.12	He put shields and spears in all the cities, and made them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his.
2CH.11.13	The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel sided with him. 
2CH.11.14	The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the 
2CH.11.15	when he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made. 
2CH.11.16	Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the 
2CH.11.17	They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon three years, following the ways of David and Solomon during this time.
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab. 
2CH.11.19	She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	Then he married Maakah daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	Rehoboam loved Maakah daughter of Absalom more than any of his other wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
2CH.11.22	Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maakah as crown prince among his brothers, in order to make him king. 
2CH.11.23	He acted wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and took many wives for them.
2CH.12.1	After Rehoboam’s position as king was established and he had become strong, he and all Israel
2CH.12.2	Because they had been unfaithful to the 
2CH.12.3	With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites and Cushites
2CH.12.4	he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he said to them, “This is what the 
2CH.12.6	The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The 
2CH.12.7	When the 
2CH.12.8	They will, however, become subject to him, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands.”
2CH.12.9	When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures of the temple of the 
2CH.12.10	So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. 
2CH.12.11	Whenever the king went to the 
2CH.12.12	Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the 
2CH.12.13	King Rehoboam established himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the 
2CH.12.14	He did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the 
2CH.12.15	As for the events of Rehoboam’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer that deal with genealogies? There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 
2CH.12.16	Rehoboam rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.
2CH.13.1	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah, 
2CH.13.2	and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maakah,
2CH.13.2	There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	Abijah went into battle with an army of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops.
2CH.13.4	Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me! 
2CH.13.5	Don’t you know that the 
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master. 
2CH.13.7	Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them.
2CH.13.8	“And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the 
2CH.13.9	But didn’t you drive out the priests of the 
2CH.13.10	“As for us, the 
2CH.13.11	Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the 
2CH.13.12	God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. People of Israel, do not fight against the 
2CH.13.13	Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them. 
2CH.13.14	Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the 
2CH.13.15	and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
2CH.13.16	The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands. 
2CH.13.17	Abijah and his troops inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel’s able men. 
2CH.13.18	The Israelites were subdued on that occasion, and the people of Judah were victorious because they relied on the 
2CH.13.19	Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages. 
2CH.13.20	Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah. And the 
2CH.13.21	But Abijah grew in strength. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
2CH.13.22	The other events of Abijah’s reign, what he did and what he said, are written in the annotations of the prophet Iddo.
2CH.14.1	And Abijah rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. Asa his son succeeded him as king, and in his days the country was at peace for ten years.
2CH.14.2	Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the 
2CH.14.3	He removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles.
2CH.14.4	He commanded Judah to seek the 
2CH.14.5	He removed the high places and incense altars in every town in Judah, and the kingdom was at peace under him. 
2CH.14.6	He built up the fortified cities of Judah, since the land was at peace. No one was at war with him during those years, for the 
2CH.14.7	“Let us build up these towns,” he said to Judah, “and put walls around them, with towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the 
2CH.14.8	Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah, equipped with large shields and with spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin, armed with small shields and with bows. All these were brave fighting men.
2CH.14.9	Zerah the Cushite marched out against them with an army of thousands upon thousands and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareshah. 
2CH.14.10	Asa went out to meet him, and they took up battle positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
2CH.14.11	Then Asa called to the 
2CH.14.12	The 
2CH.14.13	and Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. Such a great number of Cushites fell that they could not recover; they were crushed before the 
2CH.14.14	They destroyed all the villages around Gerar, for the terror of the 
2CH.14.15	They also attacked the camps of the herders and carried off droves of sheep and goats and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	The Spirit of God came on Azariah son of Oded. 
2CH.15.2	He went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The 
2CH.15.3	For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a priest to teach and without the law. 
2CH.15.4	But in their distress they turned to the 
2CH.15.5	In those days it was not safe to travel about, for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil. 
2CH.15.6	One nation was being crushed by another and one city by another, because God was troubling them with every kind of distress. 
2CH.15.7	But as for you, be strong and do not give up, for your work will be rewarded.”
2CH.15.8	When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of
2CH.15.9	Then he assembled all Judah and Benjamin and the people from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon who had settled among them, for large numbers had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the 
2CH.15.10	They assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign. 
2CH.15.11	At that time they sacrificed to the 
2CH.15.12	They entered into a covenant to seek the 
2CH.15.13	All who would not seek the 
2CH.15.14	They took an oath to the 
2CH.15.15	All Judah rejoiced about the oath because they had sworn it wholeheartedly. They sought God eagerly, and he was found by them. So the 
2CH.15.16	King Asa also deposed his grandmother Maakah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah. Asa cut it down, broke it up and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
2CH.15.17	Although he did not remove the high places from Israel, Asa’s heart was fully committed to the 
2CH.15.18	He brought into the temple of God the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated.
2CH.15.19	There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
2CH.16.2	Asa then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of the 
2CH.16.3	“Let there be a treaty between me and you,” he said, “as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me.”
2CH.16.4	Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim
2CH.16.5	When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work. 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using. With them he built up Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him: “Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the 
2CH.16.8	Were not the Cushites
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the 
2CH.16.10	Asa was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people.
2CH.16.11	The events of Asa’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.16.12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the 
2CH.16.13	Then in the forty-first year of his reign Asa died and rested with his ancestors. 
2CH.16.14	They buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes, and they made a huge fire in his honor.
2CH.17.1	Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
2CH.17.3	The 
2CH.17.4	but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel. 
2CH.17.5	The 
2CH.17.6	His heart was devoted to the ways of the 
2CH.17.7	In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah. 
2CH.17.8	With them were certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah—and the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 
2CH.17.9	They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the 
2CH.17.10	The fear of the 
2CH.17.11	Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats.
2CH.17.12	Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah 
2CH.17.13	and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	Their enrollment by families was as follows:
2CH.17.14	From Judah, commanders of units of 1,000:
2CH.17.14	Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting men;
2CH.17.15	next, Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;
2CH.17.16	next, Amasiah son of Zikri, who volunteered himself for the service of the 
2CH.17.17	From Benjamin:
2CH.17.17	Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men armed with bows and shields;
2CH.17.18	next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle.
2CH.17.19	These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
2CH.18.1	Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. 
2CH.18.2	Some years later he went down to see Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead. 
2CH.18.3	Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?”
2CH.18.3	Jehoshaphat replied, “I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war.” 
2CH.18.4	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “First seek the counsel of the 
2CH.18.5	So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—four hundred men—and asked them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?”
2CH.18.5	“Go,” they answered, “for God will give it into the king’s hand.”
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no longer a prophet of the 
2CH.18.7	The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the 
2CH.18.7	“The king should not say such a thing,” Jehoshaphat replied.
2CH.18.8	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”
2CH.18.9	Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. 
2CH.18.10	Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he declared, “This is what the 
2CH.18.11	All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. “Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious,” they said, “for the 
2CH.18.12	The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.”
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah said, “As surely as the 
2CH.18.14	When he arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?”
2CH.18.14	“Attack and be victorious,” he answered, “for they will be given into your hand.”
2CH.18.15	The king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the 
2CH.18.16	Then Micaiah answered, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the 
2CH.18.17	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?”
2CH.18.18	Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the 
2CH.18.19	And the 
2CH.18.19	“One suggested this, and another that. 
2CH.18.20	Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the 
2CH.18.20	“ ‘By what means?’ the 
2CH.18.21	“ ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said.
2CH.18.21	“ ‘You will succeed in enticing him,’ said the 
2CH.18.22	“So now the 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. “Which way did the spirit from
2CH.18.24	Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”
2CH.18.25	The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son, 
2CH.18.26	and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.’ ”
2CH.18.27	Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the 
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. 
2CH.18.29	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.” 
2CH.18.31	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, “This is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the 
2CH.18.32	for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.
2CH.18.33	But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the breastplate and the scale armor. The king told the chariot driver, “Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I’ve been wounded.” 
2CH.18.34	All day long the battle raged, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset he died.
2CH.19.1	When Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem, 
2CH.19.2	Jehu the seer, the son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said to the king, “Should you help the wicked and love
2CH.19.3	There is, however, some good in you, for you have rid the land of the Asherah poles and have set your heart on seeking God.”
2CH.19.4	Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the 
2CH.19.5	He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah. 
2CH.19.6	He told them, “Consider carefully what you do, because you are not judging for mere mortals but for the 
2CH.19.7	Now let the fear of the 
2CH.19.8	In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the 
2CH.19.9	He gave them these orders: “You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the 
2CH.19.10	In every case that comes before you from your people who live in the cities—whether bloodshed or other concerns of the law, commands, decrees or regulations—you are to warn them not to sin against the 
2CH.19.11	“Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the 
2CH.20.1	After this, the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the Meunites
2CH.20.2	Some people came and told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army is coming against you from Edom,
2CH.20.3	Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the 
2CH.20.4	The people of Judah came together to seek help from the 
2CH.20.5	Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the 
2CH.20.6	and said:
2CH.20.6	“
2CH.20.7	Our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend? 
2CH.20.8	They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your Name, saying, 
2CH.20.9	‘If calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear us and save us.’
2CH.20.10	“But now here are men from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from them and did not destroy them. 
2CH.20.11	See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance. 
2CH.20.12	Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you.”
2CH.20.13	All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, stood there before the 
2CH.20.14	Then the Spirit of the 
2CH.20.15	He said: “Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the 
2CH.20.18	Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the 
2CH.20.19	Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the 
2CH.20.20	Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the 
2CH.20.21	After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the 
2CH.20.21	“Give thanks to the 
2CH.20.21	for his love endures forever.”
2CH.20.22	As they began to sing and praise, the 
2CH.20.23	The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another.
2CH.20.24	When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped. 
2CH.20.25	So Jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing
2CH.20.26	On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berakah, where they praised the 
2CH.20.27	Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the 
2CH.20.28	They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the 
2CH.20.29	The fear of God came on all the surrounding kingdoms when they heard how the 
2CH.20.30	And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side.
2CH.20.31	So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 
2CH.20.32	He followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.20.33	The high places, however, were not removed, and the people still had not set their hearts on the God of their ancestors.
2CH.20.34	The other events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel.
2CH.20.35	Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, whose ways were wicked. 
2CH.20.36	He agreed with him to construct a fleet of trading ships.
2CH.20.37	Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the 
2CH.21.1	Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king. 
2CH.21.2	Jehoram’s brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
2CH.21.3	Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value, as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son.
2CH.21.4	When Jehoram established himself firmly over his father’s kingdom, he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the officials of Israel. 
2CH.21.5	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. 
2CH.21.6	He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.21.7	Nevertheless, because of the covenant the 
2CH.21.8	In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king. 
2CH.21.9	So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night. 
2CH.21.10	To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah.
2CH.21.10	Libnah revolted at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the 
2CH.21.11	He had also built high places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray.
2CH.21.12	Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet, which said:
2CH.21.12	“This is what the 
2CH.21.13	But you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel, and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab did. You have also murdered your own brothers, members of your own family, men who were better than you. 
2CH.21.14	So now the 
2CH.21.15	You yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the bowels, until the disease causes your bowels to come out.’ ”
2CH.21.16	The 
2CH.21.17	They attacked Judah, invaded it and carried off all the goods found in the king’s palace, together with his sons and wives. Not a son was left to him except Ahaziah,
2CH.21.18	After all this, the 
2CH.21.19	In the course of time, at the end of the second year, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great pain. His people made no funeral fire in his honor, as they had for his predecessors.
2CH.21.20	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He passed away, to no one’s regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
2CH.22.1	The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram’s youngest son, king in his place, since the raiders, who came with the Arabs into the camp, had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah was twenty-two
2CH.22.3	He too followed the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him to act wickedly. 
2CH.22.4	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.22.5	He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram
2CH.22.6	so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramoth
2CH.22.6	Then Ahaziah
2CH.22.7	Through Ahaziah’s visit to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah’s downfall. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the 
2CH.22.8	While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s relatives, who had been attending Ahaziah, and he killed them. 
2CH.22.9	He then went in search of Ahaziah, and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He was a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the 
2CH.22.10	When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of Judah. 
2CH.22.11	But Jehosheba,
2CH.22.12	He remained hidden with them at the temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
2CH.23.1	In the seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength. He made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zikri. 
2CH.23.2	They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites and the heads of Israelite families from all the towns. When they came to Jerusalem, 
2CH.23.3	the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of God.
2CH.23.3	Jehoiada said to them, “The king’s son shall reign, as the 
2CH.23.4	Now this is what you are to do: A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors, 
2CH.23.5	a third of you at the royal palace and a third at the Foundation Gate, and all the others are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the 
2CH.23.6	No one is to enter the temple of the 
2CH.23.7	The Levites are to station themselves around the king, each with weapon in hand. Anyone who enters the temple is to be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes.”
2CH.23.8	The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men—those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty—for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions. 
2CH.23.9	Then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God. 
2CH.23.10	He stationed all the men, each with his weapon in his hand, around the king—near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
2CH.23.11	Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him; they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, “Long live the king!”
2CH.23.12	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king, she went to them at the temple of the 
2CH.23.13	She looked, and there was the king, standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and musicians with their instruments were leading the praises. Then Athaliah tore her robes and shouted, “Treason! Treason!”
2CH.23.14	Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops, and said to them: “Bring her out between the ranks
2CH.23.15	So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and there they put her to death.
2CH.23.16	Jehoiada then made a covenant that he, the people and the king
2CH.23.17	All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
2CH.23.18	Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the 
2CH.23.19	He also stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the 
2CH.23.20	He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the 
2CH.23.21	All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was calm, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba. 
2CH.24.2	Joash did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the 
2CH.24.5	He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, “Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now.” But the Levites did not act at once.
2CH.24.6	Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, “Why haven’t you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the 
2CH.24.7	Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals.
2CH.24.8	At the king’s command, a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the temple of the 
2CH.24.9	A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the 
2CH.24.10	All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly, dropping them into the chest until it was full. 
2CH.24.11	Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king’s officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money. 
2CH.24.12	The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who carried out the work required for the temple of the 
2CH.24.13	The men in charge of the work were diligent, and the repairs progressed under them. They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it. 
2CH.24.14	When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made articles for the 
2CH.24.15	Now Jehoiada was old and full of years, and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty. 
2CH.24.16	He was buried with the kings in the City of David, because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple.
2CH.24.17	After the death of Jehoiada, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them. 
2CH.24.18	They abandoned the temple of the 
2CH.24.19	Although the 
2CH.24.20	Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, “This is what God says: ‘Why do you disobey the 
2CH.24.21	But they plotted against him, and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the 
2CH.24.22	King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son, who said as he lay dying, “May the 
2CH.24.23	At the turn of the year,
2CH.24.24	Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the 
2CH.24.25	When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
2CH.24.26	Those who conspired against him were Zabad,
2CH.24.27	The account of his sons, the many prophecies about him, and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.25.3	After the kingdom was firmly in his control, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king. 
2CH.25.4	Yet he did not put their children to death, but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the 
2CH.25.5	Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men fit for military service, able to handle the spear and shield. 
2CH.25.6	He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents
2CH.25.7	But a man of God came to him and said, “Your Majesty, these troops from Israel must not march with you, for the 
2CH.25.8	Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow.”
2CH.25.9	Amaziah asked the man of God, “But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?”
2CH.25.9	The man of God replied, “The 
2CH.25.10	So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage.
2CH.25.11	Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir. 
2CH.25.12	The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive, took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.
2CH.25.13	Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided towns belonging to Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.
2CH.25.14	When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them. 
2CH.25.15	The anger of the 
2CH.25.16	While he was still speaking, the king said to him, “Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?”
2CH.25.16	So the prophet stopped but said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”
2CH.25.17	After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash
2CH.25.18	But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot. 
2CH.25.19	You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud. But stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?”
2CH.25.20	Amaziah, however, would not listen, for God so worked that he might deliver them into the hands of Jehoash, because they sought the gods of Edom. 
2CH.25.21	So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah. 
2CH.25.22	Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home. 
2CH.25.23	Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah,
2CH.25.24	He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-Edom, together with the palace treasures and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.25	Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. 
2CH.25.26	As for the other events of Amaziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 
2CH.25.27	From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the 
2CH.25.28	He was brought back by horse and was buried with his ancestors in the City of Judah.
2CH.26.1	Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah,
2CH.26.2	He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his ancestors.
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jekoliah; she was from Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.26.5	He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear
2CH.26.6	He went to war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod. He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. 
2CH.26.7	God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites. 
2CH.26.8	The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, because he had become very powerful.
2CH.26.9	Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate and at the angle of the wall, and he fortified them. 
2CH.26.10	He also built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns, because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain. He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.
2CH.26.11	Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officials. 
2CH.26.12	The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600. 
2CH.26.13	Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies. 
2CH.26.14	Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army. 
2CH.26.15	In Jerusalem he made devices invented for use on the towers and on the corner defenses so that soldiers could shoot arrows and hurl large stones from the walls. His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful.
2CH.26.16	But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the 
2CH.26.17	Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the 
2CH.26.18	They confronted King Uzziah and said, “It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the 
2CH.26.19	Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the 
2CH.26.20	When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the 
2CH.26.21	King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house
2CH.26.22	The other events of Uzziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
2CH.26.23	Uzziah rested with his ancestors and was buried near them in a cemetery that belonged to the kings, for people said, “He had leprosy.” And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.27.3	Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the 
2CH.27.4	He built towns in the hill country of Judah and forts and towers in the wooded areas.
2CH.27.5	Jotham waged war against the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. That year the Ammonites paid him a hundred talents
2CH.27.6	Jotham grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the 
2CH.27.7	The other events in Jotham’s reign, including all his wars and the other things he did, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. 
2CH.27.9	Jotham rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Ahaz his son succeeded him as king.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.28.2	He followed the ways of the kings of Israel and also made idols for worshiping the Baals. 
2CH.28.3	He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his children in the fire, engaging in the detestable practices of the nations the 
2CH.28.4	He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.
2CH.28.5	Therefore the 
2CH.28.5	He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him. 
2CH.28.6	In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah—because Judah had forsaken the 
2CH.28.7	Zikri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king. 
2CH.28.8	The men of Israel took captive from their fellow Israelites who were from Judah two hundred thousand wives, sons and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they carried back to Samaria.
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren’t you also guilty of sins against the 
2CH.28.11	Now listen to me! Send back your fellow Israelites you have taken as prisoners, for the 
2CH.28.12	Then some of the leaders in Ephraim—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—confronted those who were arriving from the war. 
2CH.28.13	“You must not bring those prisoners here,” they said, “or we will be guilty before the 
2CH.28.14	So the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly. 
2CH.28.15	The men designated by name took the prisoners, and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked. They provided them with clothes and sandals, food and drink, and healing balm. All those who were weak they put on donkeys. So they took them back to their fellow Israelites at Jericho, the City of Palms, and returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings
2CH.28.17	The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners, 
2CH.28.18	while the Philistines had raided towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah. They captured and occupied Beth Shemesh, Aijalon and Gederoth, as well as Soko, Timnah and Gimzo, with their surrounding villages. 
2CH.28.19	The 
2CH.28.20	Tiglath-Pileser
2CH.28.21	Ahaz took some of the things from the temple of the 
2CH.28.22	In his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the 
2CH.28.23	He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus, who had defeated him; for he thought, “Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me.” But they were his downfall and the downfall of all Israel.
2CH.28.24	Ahaz gathered together the furnishings from the temple of God and cut them in pieces. He shut the doors of the 
2CH.28.25	In every town in Judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to other gods and aroused the anger of the 
2CH.28.26	The other events of his reign and all his ways, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.28.27	Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.29.3	In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of the temple of the 
2CH.29.4	He brought in the priests and the Levites, assembled them in the square on the east side 
2CH.29.5	and said: “Listen to me, Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the 
2CH.29.6	Our parents were unfaithful; they did evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.29.7	They also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	Therefore, the anger of the 
2CH.29.9	This is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons and daughters and our wives are in captivity. 
2CH.29.10	Now I intend to make a covenant with the 
2CH.29.11	My sons, do not be negligent now, for the 
2CH.29.12	Then these Levites set to work:
2CH.29.12	from the Kohathites,
2CH.29.12	Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah;
2CH.29.12	from the Merarites,
2CH.29.12	Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel;
2CH.29.12	from the Gershonites,
2CH.29.12	Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah;
2CH.29.13	from the descendants of Elizaphan,
2CH.29.13	Shimri and Jeiel;
2CH.29.13	from the descendants of Asaph,
2CH.29.13	Zechariah and Mattaniah;
2CH.29.14	from the descendants of Heman,
2CH.29.14	Jehiel and Shimei;
2CH.29.14	from the descendants of Jeduthun,
2CH.29.14	Shemaiah and Uzziel.
2CH.29.15	When they had assembled their fellow Levites and consecrated themselves, they went in to purify the temple of the 
2CH.29.16	The priests went into the sanctuary of the 
2CH.29.17	They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported: “We have purified the entire temple of the 
2CH.29.19	We have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king. They are now in front of the 
2CH.29.20	Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the 
2CH.29.21	They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering
2CH.29.22	So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and splashed it against the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and splashed their blood against the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and splashed their blood against the altar. 
2CH.29.23	The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them. 
2CH.29.24	The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
2CH.29.25	He stationed the Levites in the temple of the 
2CH.29.26	So the Levites stood ready with David’s instruments, and the priests with their trumpets.
2CH.29.27	Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. As the offering began, singing to the 
2CH.29.28	The whole assembly bowed in worship, while the musicians played and the trumpets sounded. All this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed.
2CH.29.29	When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped. 
2CH.29.30	King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah said, “You have now dedicated yourselves to the 
2CH.29.32	The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs—all of them for burnt offerings to the 
2CH.29.33	The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats. 
2CH.29.34	The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their relatives the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been. 
2CH.29.35	There were burnt offerings in abundance, together with the fat of the fellowship offerings and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings.
2CH.29.35	So the service of the temple of the 
2CH.29.36	Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about for his people, because it was done so quickly.
2CH.30.1	Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the temple of the 
2CH.30.2	The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month. 
2CH.30.3	They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.4	The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly. 
2CH.30.5	They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the 
2CH.30.6	At the king’s command, couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials, which read:
2CH.30.6	“People of Israel, return to the 
2CH.30.7	Do not be like your parents and your fellow Israelites, who were unfaithful to the 
2CH.30.8	Do not be stiff-necked, as your ancestors were; submit to the 
2CH.30.9	If you return to the 
2CH.30.10	The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, but people scorned and ridiculed them. 
2CH.30.11	Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	Also in Judah the hand of God was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered, following the word of the 
2CH.30.13	A very large crowd of people assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month. 
2CH.30.14	They removed the altars in Jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
2CH.30.15	They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the 
2CH.30.16	Then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them by the Levites. 
2CH.30.17	Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves, the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs
2CH.30.18	Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the 
2CH.30.19	who sets their heart on seeking God—the 
2CH.30.20	And the 
2CH.30.21	The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great rejoicing, while the Levites and priests praised the 
2CH.30.22	Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites, who showed good understanding of the service of the 
2CH.30.23	The whole assembly then agreed to celebrate the festival seven more days; so for another seven days they celebrated joyfully. 
2CH.30.24	Hezekiah king of Judah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats for the assembly, and the officials provided them with a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and goats. A great number of priests consecrated themselves. 
2CH.30.25	The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites and all who had assembled from Israel, including the foreigners who had come from Israel and also those who resided in Judah. 
2CH.30.26	There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.27	The priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard them, for their prayer reached heaven, his holy dwelling place.
2CH.31.1	When all this had ended, the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. They destroyed the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After they had destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property.
2CH.31.2	Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to divisions—each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites—to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, to minister, to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the 
2CH.31.3	The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, at the New Moons and at the appointed festivals as written in the Law of the 
2CH.31.4	He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the 
2CH.31.5	As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, olive oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything. 
2CH.31.6	The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the 
2CH.31.7	They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month. 
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the 
2CH.31.9	Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps; 
2CH.31.10	and Azariah the chief priest, from the family of Zadok, answered, “Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the 
2CH.31.11	Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the 
2CH.31.12	Then they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Konaniah, a Levite, was the overseer in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank. 
2CH.31.13	Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah were assistants of Konaniah and Shimei his brother. All these served by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God.
2CH.31.14	Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions made to the 
2CH.31.15	Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shekaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests, distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions, old and young alike.
2CH.31.16	In addition, they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records—all who would enter the temple of the 
2CH.31.17	And they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more, according to their responsibilities and their divisions. 
2CH.31.18	They included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves.
2CH.31.19	As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farm lands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites.
2CH.31.20	This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the 
2CH.31.21	In everything that he undertook in the service of God’s temple and in obedience to the law and the commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.
2CH.32.1	After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself. 
2CH.32.2	When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to wage war against Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they helped him. 
2CH.32.4	They gathered a large group of people who blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings
2CH.32.5	Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the terraces
2CH.32.6	He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words: 
2CH.32.7	“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him. 
2CH.32.8	With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the 
2CH.32.9	Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there:
2CH.32.10	“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege? 
2CH.32.11	When Hezekiah says, ‘The 
2CH.32.12	Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god’s high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it’?
2CH.32.13	“Do you not know what I and my predecessors have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand? 
2CH.32.14	Who of all the gods of these nations that my predecessors destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand? 
2CH.32.15	Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my predecessors. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!”
2CH.32.16	Sennacherib’s officers spoke further against the 
2CH.32.17	The king also wrote letters ridiculing the 
2CH.32.18	Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city. 
2CH.32.19	They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world—the work of human hands.
2CH.32.20	King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this. 
2CH.32.21	And the 
2CH.32.22	So the 
2CH.32.23	Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah’s heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the 
2CH.32.26	Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; therefore the 
2CH.32.27	Hezekiah had very great wealth and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables. 
2CH.32.28	He also made buildings to store the harvest of grain, new wine and olive oil; and he made stalls for various kinds of cattle, and pens for the flocks. 
2CH.32.29	He built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds, for God had given him very great riches.
2CH.32.30	It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded in everything he undertook. 
2CH.32.31	But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart.
2CH.32.32	The other events of Hezekiah’s reign and his acts of devotion are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.32.33	Hezekiah rested with his ancestors and was buried on the hill where the tombs of David’s descendants are. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. 
2CH.33.2	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.33.3	He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished; he also erected altars to the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them. 
2CH.33.4	He built altars in the temple of the 
2CH.33.5	In both courts of the temple of the 
2CH.33.6	He sacrificed his children in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced divination and witchcraft, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.33.7	He took the image he had made and put it in God’s temple, of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever. 
2CH.33.8	I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees and regulations given through Moses.” 
2CH.33.9	But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the 
2CH.33.10	The 
2CH.33.11	So the 
2CH.33.12	In his distress he sought the favor of the 
2CH.33.13	And when he prayed to him, the 
2CH.33.14	Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.
2CH.33.15	He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the 
2CH.33.16	Then he restored the altar of the 
2CH.33.17	The people, however, continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the 
2CH.33.18	The other events of Manasseh’s reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the 
2CH.33.19	His prayer and how God was moved by his entreaty, as well as all his sins and unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself—all these are written in the records of the seers.
2CH.33.20	Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in his palace. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.
2CH.33.21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. 
2CH.33.22	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.33.23	But unlike his father Manasseh, he did not humble himself before the 
2CH.33.24	Amon’s officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace. 
2CH.33.25	Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. 
2CH.34.2	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.34.3	In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles and idols. 
2CH.34.4	Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them, and smashed the Asherah poles and the idols. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. 
2CH.34.5	He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.6	In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them, 
2CH.34.7	he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, to purify the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city, with Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the temple of the 
2CH.34.9	They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God, which the Levites who were the gatekeepers had collected from the people of Manasseh, Ephraim and the entire remnant of Israel and from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.10	Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the 
2CH.34.11	They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone, and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.
2CH.34.12	The workers labored faithfully. Over them to direct them were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites descended from Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descended from Kohath. The Levites—all who were skilled in playing musical instruments— 
2CH.34.13	had charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were secretaries, scribes and gatekeepers.
2CH.34.14	While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the temple of the 
2CH.34.15	Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the 
2CH.34.16	Then Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to him: “Your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them. 
2CH.34.17	They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the 
2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
2CH.34.19	When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his robes. 
2CH.34.20	He gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah,
2CH.34.21	“Go and inquire of the 
2CH.34.22	Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him
2CH.34.23	She said to them, “This is what the 
2CH.34.24	‘This is what the 
2CH.34.25	Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all that their hands have made,
2CH.34.26	Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the 
2CH.34.27	Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the 
2CH.34.28	Now I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here.’ ”
2CH.34.28	So they took her answer back to the king.
2CH.34.29	Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	He went up to the temple of the 
2CH.34.31	The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the 
2CH.34.32	Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge themselves to it; the people of Jerusalem did this in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.
2CH.34.33	Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the Israelites, and he had all who were present in Israel serve the 
2CH.35.1	Josiah celebrated the Passover to the 
2CH.35.2	He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the 
2CH.35.3	He said to the Levites, who instructed all Israel and who had been consecrated to the 
2CH.35.4	Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according to the instructions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon.
2CH.35.5	“Stand in the holy place with a group of Levites for each subdivision of the families of your fellow Israelites, the lay people. 
2CH.35.6	Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves and prepare the lambs for your fellow Israelites, doing what the 
2CH.35.7	Josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand lambs and goats for the Passover offerings, and also three thousand cattle—all from the king’s own possessions.
2CH.35.8	His officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel, the officials in charge of God’s temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred Passover offerings and three hundred cattle. 
2CH.35.9	Also Konaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites.
2CH.35.10	The service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had ordered. 
2CH.35.11	The Passover lambs were slaughtered, and the priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them, while the Levites skinned the animals. 
2CH.35.12	They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the subdivisions of the families of the people to offer to the 
2CH.35.13	They roasted the Passover animals over the fire as prescribed, and boiled the holy offerings in pots, caldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people. 
2CH.35.14	After this, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests.
2CH.35.15	The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, were in the places prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun the king’s seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts, because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them.
2CH.35.16	So at that time the entire service of the 
2CH.35.17	The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. 
2CH.35.18	The Passover had not been observed like this in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel; and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as did Josiah, with the priests, the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were there with the people of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign.
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Necho king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle. 
2CH.35.21	But Necho sent messengers to him, saying, “What quarrel is there, king of Judah, between you and me? It is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you.”
2CH.35.22	Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Necho had said at God’s command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.
2CH.35.23	Archers shot King Josiah, and he told his officers, “Take me away; I am badly wounded.” 
2CH.35.24	So they took him out of his chariot, put him in his other chariot and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.
2CH.35.25	Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and to this day all the male and female singers commemorate Josiah in the laments. These became a tradition in Israel and are written in the Laments.
2CH.35.26	The other events of Josiah’s reign and his acts of devotion in accordance with what is written in the Law of the 
2CH.35.27	all the events, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.1	And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
2CH.36.2	Jehoahaz
2CH.36.3	The king of Egypt dethroned him in Jerusalem and imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents
2CH.36.4	The king of Egypt made Eliakim, a brother of Jehoahaz, king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Necho took Eliakim’s brother Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt.
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. He did evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.36.6	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked him and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon articles from the temple of the 
2CH.36.8	The other events of Jehoiakim’s reign, the detestable things he did and all that was found against him, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king.
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eighteen
2CH.36.10	In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon, together with articles of value from the temple of the 
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. 
2CH.36.12	He did evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.36.13	He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him take an oath in God’s name. He became stiff-necked and hardened his heart and would not turn to the 
2CH.36.14	Furthermore, all the leaders of the priests and the people became more and more unfaithful, following all the detestable practices of the nations and defiling the temple of the 
2CH.36.15	The 
2CH.36.16	But they mocked God’s messengers, despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the 
2CH.36.17	He brought up against them the king of the Babylonians,
2CH.36.18	He carried to Babylon all the articles from the temple of God, both large and small, and the treasures of the 
2CH.36.19	They set fire to God’s temple and broke down the wall of Jerusalem; they burned all the palaces and destroyed everything of value there.
2CH.36.20	He carried into exile to Babylon the remnant, who escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and his successors until the kingdom of Persia came to power. 
2CH.36.21	The land enjoyed its sabbath rests; all the time of its desolation it rested, until the seventy years were completed in fulfillment of the word of the 
2CH.36.22	In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the 
2CH.36.23	“This is what Cyrus king of Persia says:
2CH.36.23	“ ‘The 
EZR.1.1	In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the 
EZR.1.2	“This is what Cyrus king of Persia says:
EZR.1.2	“ ‘The 
EZR.1.3	Any of his people among you may go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the 
EZR.1.4	And in any locality where survivors may now be living, the people are to provide them with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem.’ ”
EZR.1.5	Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and Levites—everyone whose heart God had moved—prepared to go up and build the house of the 
EZR.1.6	All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuable gifts, in addition to all the freewill offerings.
EZR.1.7	Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the 
EZR.1.8	Cyrus king of Persia had them brought by Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
EZR.1.9	This was the inventory:
EZR.1.9	gold dishes

EZR.1.9	silver dishes

EZR.1.10	other articles
EZR.1.10	1,000
EZR.1.11	In all, there were 5,400 articles of gold and of silver. Sheshbazzar brought all these along with the exiles when they came up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
EZR.2.1	Now these are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive to Babylon (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to their own town, 
EZR.2.2	in company with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum and Baanah):

EZR.2.62	These searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean. 
EZR.2.63	The governor ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until there was a priest ministering with the Urim and Thummim.

EZR.2.70	The priests, the Levites, the musicians, the gatekeepers and the temple servants settled in their own towns, along with some of the other people, and the rest of the Israelites settled in their towns.
EZR.3.1	When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns, the people assembled together as one in Jerusalem. 
EZR.3.2	Then Joshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his associates began to build the altar of the God of Israel to sacrifice burnt offerings on it, in accordance with what is written in the Law of Moses the man of God. 
EZR.3.3	Despite their fear of the peoples around them, they built the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the 
EZR.3.4	Then in accordance with what is written, they celebrated the Festival of Tabernacles with the required number of burnt offerings prescribed for each day. 
EZR.3.5	After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred festivals of the 
EZR.3.6	On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the 
EZR.3.7	Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and gave food and drink and olive oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar logs by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia.
EZR.3.8	In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak and the rest of the people (the priests and the Levites and all who had returned from the captivity to Jerusalem) began the work. They appointed Levites twenty years old and older to supervise the building of the house of the 
EZR.3.9	Joshua and his sons and brothers and Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of Hodaviah
EZR.3.10	When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the 
EZR.3.11	With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the 
EZR.3.11	“He is good;
EZR.3.11	his love toward Israel endures forever.”
EZR.3.11	And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the 
EZR.3.12	But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads, who had seen the former temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy. 
EZR.3.13	No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far away.
EZR.4.1	When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the 
EZR.4.2	they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said, “Let us help you build because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.”
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, Joshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered, “You have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone will build it for the 
EZR.4.4	Then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building.
EZR.4.5	They bribed officials to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.4.6	At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes,
EZR.4.7	And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. The letter was written in Aramaic script and in the Aramaic language.
EZR.4.8	Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:
EZR.4.9	Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary, together with the rest of their associates—the judges, officials and administrators over the people from Persia, Uruk and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa, 
EZR.4.10	and the other people whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates.
EZR.4.11	(This is a copy of the letter they sent him.)
EZR.4.11	To King Artaxerxes,
EZR.4.11	From your servants in Trans-Euphrates:
EZR.4.12	The king should know that the people who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations.
EZR.4.13	Furthermore, the king should know that if this city is built and its walls are restored, no more taxes, tribute or duty will be paid, and eventually the royal revenues will suffer.
EZR.4.14	Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king, 
EZR.4.15	so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city, troublesome to kings and provinces, a place with a long history of sedition. That is why this city was destroyed. 
EZR.4.16	We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates.
EZR.4.17	The king sent this reply:
EZR.4.17	To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates:
EZR.4.17	Greetings.
EZR.4.18	The letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence. 
EZR.4.19	I issued an order and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition. 
EZR.4.20	Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of Trans-Euphrates, and taxes, tribute and duty were paid to them. 
EZR.4.21	Now issue an order to these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order. 
EZR.4.22	Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the detriment of the royal interests?
EZR.4.23	As soon as the copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop.
EZR.4.24	Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.5.1	Now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them. 
EZR.5.2	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jozadak set to work to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them, supporting them.
EZR.5.3	At that time Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates went to them and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and to finish it?” 
EZR.5.4	They
EZR.5.5	But the eye of their God was watching over the elders of the Jews, and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply be received.
EZR.5.6	This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, the officials of Trans-Euphrates, sent to King Darius. 
EZR.5.7	The report they sent him read as follows:
EZR.5.7	To King Darius:
EZR.5.7	Cordial greetings.
EZR.5.8	The king should know that we went to the district of Judah, to the temple of the great God. The people are building it with large stones and placing the timbers in the walls. The work is being carried on with diligence and is making rapid progress under their direction.
EZR.5.9	We questioned the elders and asked them, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and to finish it?” 
EZR.5.10	We also asked them their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.
EZR.5.11	This is the answer they gave us:
EZR.5.11	“We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, one that a great king of Israel built and finished. 
EZR.5.12	But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of Babylon, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.
EZR.5.13	“However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God. 
EZR.5.14	He even removed from the temple
EZR.5.15	and he told him, ‘Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.’
EZR.5.16	“So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished.”
EZR.5.17	Now if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.
EZR.6.1	King Darius then issued an order, and they searched in the archives stored in the treasury at Babylon. 
EZR.6.2	A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana in the province of Media, and this was written on it:
EZR.6.2	Memorandum:
EZR.6.3	In the first year of King Cyrus, the king issued a decree concerning the temple of God in Jerusalem:
EZR.6.3	Let the temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices, and let its foundations be laid. It is to be sixty cubits
EZR.6.4	with three courses of large stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid by the royal treasury. 
EZR.6.5	Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in the house of God.
EZR.6.6	Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and you other officials of that province, stay away from there. 
EZR.6.7	Do not interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its site.
EZR.6.8	Moreover, I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the Jews in the construction of this house of God:
EZR.6.8	Their expenses are to be fully paid out of the royal treasury, from the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so that the work will not stop. 
EZR.6.9	Whatever is needed—young bulls, rams, male lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and olive oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem—must be given them daily without fail, 
EZR.6.10	so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons.
EZR.6.11	Furthermore, I decree that if anyone defies this edict, a beam is to be pulled from their house and they are to be impaled on it. And for this crime their house is to be made a pile of rubble. 
EZR.6.12	May God, who has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem.
EZR.6.12	I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence.
EZR.6.13	Then, because of the decree King Darius had sent, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates carried it out with diligence. 
EZR.6.14	So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia. 
EZR.6.15	The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
EZR.6.16	Then the people of Israel—the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles—celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy. 
EZR.6.17	For the dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and, as a sin offering
EZR.6.18	And they installed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem, according to what is written in the Book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles celebrated the Passover. 
EZR.6.20	The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were all ceremonially clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their relatives the priests and for themselves. 
EZR.6.21	So the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the 
EZR.6.22	For seven days they celebrated with joy the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because the 
EZR.7.1	After these things, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 
EZR.7.2	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest— 
EZR.7.6	this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a teacher well versed in the Law of Moses, which the 
EZR.7.7	Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers and temple servants, also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
EZR.7.8	Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king. 
EZR.7.9	He had begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the gracious hand of his God was on him. 
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the 
EZR.7.11	This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the 
EZR.7.12	Artaxerxes, king of kings,
EZR.7.12	To Ezra the priest, teacher of the Law of the God of heaven:
EZR.7.12	Greetings.
EZR.7.13	Now I decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including priests and Levites, who volunteer to go to Jerusalem with you, may go. 
EZR.7.14	You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your hand. 
EZR.7.15	Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, 
EZR.7.16	together with all the silver and gold you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the temple of their God in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.17	With this money be sure to buy bulls, rams and male lambs, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem.
EZR.7.18	You and your fellow Israelites may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, in accordance with the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for worship in the temple of your God. 
EZR.7.20	And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you are responsible to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury.
EZR.7.21	Now I, King Artaxerxes, decree that all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates are to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest, the teacher of the Law of the God of heaven, may ask of you— 
EZR.7.22	up to a hundred talents
EZR.7.23	Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should his wrath fall on the realm of the king and of his sons? 
EZR.7.24	You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of the priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers, temple servants or other workers at this house of God.
EZR.7.25	And you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom of your God, which you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach any who do not know them. 
EZR.7.26	Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.
EZR.7.27	Praise be to the 
EZR.7.28	and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the king’s powerful officials. Because the hand of the 
EZR.8.1	These are the family heads and those registered with them who came up with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
EZR.8.2	of the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom;
EZR.8.2	of the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel;
EZR.8.2	of the descendants of David, Hattush 
EZR.8.3	of the descendants of Shekaniah;
EZR.8.3	of the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered 150 men;
EZR.8.4	of the descendants of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men;
EZR.8.5	of the descendants of Zattu,
EZR.8.6	of the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men;
EZR.8.7	of the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men;
EZR.8.8	of the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him 80 men;
EZR.8.9	of the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men;
EZR.8.10	of the descendants of Bani,
EZR.8.11	of the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28 men;
EZR.8.12	of the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men;
EZR.8.13	of the descendants of Adonikam, the last ones, whose names were Eliphelet, Jeuel and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men;
EZR.8.14	of the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai and Zakkur, and with them 70 men.
EZR.8.15	I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there. 
EZR.8.16	So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning, 
EZR.8.17	and I ordered them to go to Iddo, the leader in Kasiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants in Kasiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God. 
EZR.8.18	Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah’s sons and brothers, 18 in all; 
EZR.8.19	and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 in all. 
EZR.8.20	They also brought 220 of the temple servants—a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.
EZR.8.21	There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions. 
EZR.8.22	I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, “The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him.” 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.
EZR.8.24	Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, namely, Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers, 
EZR.8.25	and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God. 
EZR.8.26	I weighed out to them 650 talents
EZR.8.27	20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics,
EZR.8.28	I said to them, “You as well as these articles are consecrated to the 
EZR.8.29	Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the 
EZR.8.30	Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
EZR.8.31	On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way. 
EZR.8.32	So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days.
EZR.8.33	On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 
EZR.8.34	Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time.
EZR.8.35	Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering,
EZR.8.36	They also delivered the king’s orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God.
EZR.9.1	After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, “The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites. 
EZR.9.2	They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.”
EZR.9.3	When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled. 
EZR.9.4	Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.
EZR.9.5	Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the 
EZR.9.6	and prayed:
EZR.9.6	“I am too ashamed and disgraced, my God, to lift up my face to you, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.
EZR.9.8	“But now, for a brief moment, the 
EZR.9.9	Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	“But now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commands 
EZR.9.11	you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: ‘The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other. 
EZR.9.12	Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.’
EZR.9.13	“What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have given us a remnant like this. 
EZR.9.14	Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor? 
EZR.9.15	, the God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.”
EZR.10.1	While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites—men, women and children—gathered around him. They too wept bitterly. 
EZR.10.2	Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. 
EZR.10.3	Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. 
EZR.10.4	Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.”
EZR.10.5	So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath. 
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
EZR.10.7	A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. 
EZR.10.8	Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
EZR.10.9	Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. 
EZR.10.10	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt. 
EZR.10.11	Now honor
EZR.10.12	The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: “You are right! We must do as you say. 
EZR.10.13	But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing. 
EZR.10.14	Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.” 
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.
EZR.10.16	So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases, 
EZR.10.17	and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.
EZR.10.18	Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign women:
EZR.10.18	From the descendants of Joshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah. 
EZR.10.19	(They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.)
EZR.10.20	From the descendants of Immer:
EZR.10.20	Hanani and Zebadiah.
EZR.10.21	From the descendants of Harim:

EZR.10.25	And among the other Israelites:

EZR.10.34	From the descendants of Bani:
EZR.10.34	Maadai, Amram, Uel, 
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Keluhi, 
EZR.10.36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 
EZR.10.37	Mattaniah, Mattenai and Jaasu.
EZR.10.38	From the descendants of Binnui:

EZR.10.43	From the descendants of Nebo:
EZR.10.43	Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel and Benaiah.
EZR.10.44	All these had married foreign women, and some of them had children by these wives.
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah:
NEH.1.1	In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa, 
NEH.1.2	Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.
NEH.1.3	They said to me, “Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.”
NEH.1.4	When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. 
NEH.1.5	Then I said:
NEH.1.5	“
NEH.1.6	let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father’s family, have committed against you. 
NEH.1.7	We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.
NEH.1.8	“Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations, 
NEH.1.9	but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.’
NEH.1.10	“They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand. 
NEH.1.11	Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man.”
NEH.1.11	I was cupbearer to the king.
NEH.2.1	In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before, 
NEH.2.2	so the king asked me, “Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart.”
NEH.2.2	I was very much afraid, 
NEH.2.3	but I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”
NEH.2.4	The king said to me, “What is it you want?”
NEH.2.4	Then I prayed to the God of heaven, 
NEH.2.5	and I answered the king, “If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I can rebuild it.”
NEH.2.6	Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?” It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time.
NEH.2.7	I also said to him, “If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah? 
NEH.2.8	And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal park, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?” And because the gracious hand of my God was on me, the king granted my requests. 
NEH.2.9	So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.
NEH.2.10	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.
NEH.2.11	I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days 
NEH.2.12	I set out during the night with a few others. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.
NEH.2.13	By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal
NEH.2.14	Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through; 
NEH.2.15	so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate. 
NEH.2.16	The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.
NEH.2.17	Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace.” 
NEH.2.18	I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the king had said to me.
NEH.2.18	They replied, “Let us start rebuilding.” So they began this good work.
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. “What is this you are doing?” they asked. “Are you rebelling against the king?”
NEH.2.20	I answered them by saying, “The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it.”
NEH.3.1	Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set its doors in place, building as far as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and as far as the Tower of Hananel. 
NEH.3.2	The men of Jericho built the adjoining section, and Zakkur son of Imri built next to them.
NEH.3.3	The Fish Gate was rebuilt by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid its beams and put its doors and bolts and bars in place. 
NEH.3.4	Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired the next section. Next to him Meshullam son of Berekiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs, and next to him Zadok son of Baana also made repairs. 
NEH.3.5	The next section was repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work under their supervisors.
NEH.3.6	The Jeshanah
NEH.3.7	Next to them, repairs were made by men from Gibeon and Mizpah—Melatiah of Gibeon and Jadon of Meronoth—places under the authority of the governor of Trans-Euphrates. 
NEH.3.8	Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, repaired the next section; and Hananiah, one of the perfume-makers, made repairs next to that. They restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall. 
NEH.3.9	Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the next section. 
NEH.3.10	Adjoining this, Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house, and Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs next to him. 
NEH.3.11	Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Ovens. 
NEH.3.12	Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the next section with the help of his daughters.
NEH.3.13	The Valley Gate was repaired by Hanun and the residents of Zanoah. They rebuilt it and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place. They also repaired a thousand cubits
NEH.3.14	The Dung Gate was repaired by Malkijah son of Rekab, ruler of the district of Beth Hakkerem. He rebuilt it and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place.
NEH.3.15	The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallun son of Kol-Hozeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah. He rebuilt it, roofing it over and putting its doors and bolts and bars in place. He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Siloam,
NEH.3.16	Beyond him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of a half-district of Beth Zur, made repairs up to a point opposite the tombs
NEH.3.17	Next to him, the repairs were made by the Levites under Rehum son of Bani. Beside him, Hashabiah, ruler of half the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his district. 
NEH.3.18	Next to him, the repairs were made by their fellow Levites under Binnui
NEH.3.19	Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section, from a point facing the ascent to the armory as far as the angle of the wall. 
NEH.3.20	Next to him, Baruch son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the angle to the entrance of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 
NEH.3.21	Next to him, Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired another section, from the entrance of Eliashib’s house to the end of it.
NEH.3.22	The repairs next to him were made by the priests from the surrounding region. 
NEH.3.23	Beyond them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their house; and next to them, Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs beside his house. 
NEH.3.24	Next to him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from Azariah’s house to the angle and the corner, 
NEH.3.25	and Palal son of Uzai worked opposite the angle and the tower projecting from the upper palace near the court of the guard. Next to him, Pedaiah son of Parosh 
NEH.3.26	and the temple servants living on the hill of Ophel made repairs up to a point opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower. 
NEH.3.27	Next to them, the men of Tekoa repaired another section, from the great projecting tower to the wall of Ophel.
NEH.3.28	Above the Horse Gate, the priests made repairs, each in front of his own house. 
NEH.3.29	Next to them, Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. Next to him, Shemaiah son of Shekaniah, the guard at the East Gate, made repairs. 
NEH.3.30	Next to him, Hananiah son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. Next to them, Meshullam son of Berekiah made repairs opposite his living quarters. 
NEH.3.31	Next to him, Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate, and as far as the room above the corner; 
NEH.3.32	and between the room above the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs.
NEH.4.1	When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews, 
NEH.4.2	and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, “What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble—burned as they are?”
NEH.4.3	Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, “What they are building—even a fox climbing up on it would break down their wall of stones!”
NEH.4.4	Hear us, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. 
NEH.4.5	Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of
NEH.4.6	So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart.
NEH.4.7	But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the people of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem’s walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry. 
NEH.4.8	They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it. 
NEH.4.9	But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.
NEH.4.10	Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall.”
NEH.4.11	Also our enemies said, “Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work.”
NEH.4.12	Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”
NEH.4.13	Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows. 
NEH.4.14	After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.”
NEH.4.15	When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to our own work.
NEH.4.16	From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah 
NEH.4.17	who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other, 
NEH.4.18	and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.
NEH.4.19	Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall. 
NEH.4.20	Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!”
NEH.4.21	So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out. 
NEH.4.22	At that time I also said to the people, “Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and as workers by day.” 
NEH.4.23	Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water.
NEH.5.1	Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews. 
NEH.5.2	Some were saying, “We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain.”
NEH.5.3	Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine.”
NEH.5.4	Still others were saying, “We have had to borrow money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards. 
NEH.5.5	Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our fellow Jews and though our children are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.”
NEH.5.6	When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry. 
NEH.5.7	I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, “You are charging your own people interest!” So I called together a large meeting to deal with them 
NEH.5.8	and said: “As far as possible, we have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!” They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.
NEH.5.9	So I continued, “What you are doing is not right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies? 
NEH.5.10	I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let us stop charging interest! 
NEH.5.11	Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the interest you are charging them—one percent of the money, grain, new wine and olive oil.”
NEH.5.12	“We will give it back,” they said. “And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say.”
NEH.5.12	Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised. 
NEH.5.13	I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, “In this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise. So may such a person be shaken out and emptied!”
NEH.5.13	At this the whole assembly said, “Amen,” and praised the 
NEH.5.14	Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year—twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor. 
NEH.5.15	But the earlier governors—those preceding me—placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels
NEH.5.16	Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we
NEH.5.17	Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations. 
NEH.5.18	Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.
NEH.5.19	Remember me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people.
NEH.6.1	When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates— 
NEH.6.2	Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages
NEH.6.2	But they were scheming to harm me; 
NEH.6.3	so I sent messengers to them with this reply: “I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?” 
NEH.6.4	Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer.
NEH.6.5	Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter 
NEH.6.6	in which was written:
NEH.6.6	“It is reported among the nations—and Geshem
NEH.6.7	and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us meet together.”
NEH.6.8	I sent him this reply: “Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.”
NEH.6.9	They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.”
NEH.6.9	But I prayed, “Now strengthen my hands.”
NEH.6.10	One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you—by night they are coming to kill you.”
NEH.6.11	But I said, “Should a man like me run away? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!” 
NEH.6.12	I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
NEH.6.13	He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me.
NEH.6.14	Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have been trying to intimidate me. 
NEH.6.15	So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.
NEH.6.16	When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.
NEH.6.17	Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them. 
NEH.6.18	For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shekaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. 
NEH.6.19	Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
NEH.7.1	After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers, the musicians and the Levites were appointed. 
NEH.7.2	I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most people do. 
NEH.7.3	I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses.”
NEH.7.4	Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt. 
NEH.7.5	So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there:
NEH.7.6	These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town, 
NEH.7.7	in company with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum and Baanah):

NEH.7.60	392
NEH.7.61	The following came up from the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon and Immer, but they could not show that their families were descended from Israel:
NEH.7.62	the descendants of
NEH.7.62	Delaiah, Tobiah and Nekoda
NEH.7.62	642
NEH.7.63	And from among the priests:
NEH.7.63	the descendants of
NEH.7.63	Hobaiah, Hakkoz and Barzillai (a man who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by that name).
NEH.7.64	These searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean. 
NEH.7.65	The governor, therefore, ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until there should be a priest ministering with the Urim and Thummim.
NEH.7.66	The whole company numbered 42,360, 
NEH.7.67	besides their 7,337 male and female slaves; and they also had 245 male and female singers. 
NEH.7.68	There were 736 horses, 245 mules,

NEH.7.70	Some of the heads of the families contributed to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 darics

NEH.7.72	The total given by the rest of the people was 20,000 darics of gold, 2,000 minas
NEH.7.73	The priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the musicians and the temple servants, along with certain of the people and the rest of the Israelites, settled in their own towns.
NEH.7.73	When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns,
NEH.8.1	all the people came together as one in the square before the Water Gate. They told Ezra the teacher of the Law to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the 
NEH.8.2	So on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand. 
NEH.8.3	He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.
NEH.8.4	Ezra the teacher of the Law stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him on his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam.
NEH.8.5	Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them; and as he opened it, the people all stood up. 
NEH.8.6	Ezra praised the 
NEH.8.7	The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan and Pelaiah—instructed the people in the Law while the people were standing there. 
NEH.8.8	They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear
NEH.8.9	Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and teacher of the Law, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, “This day is holy to the 
NEH.8.10	Nehemiah said, “Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the 
NEH.8.11	The Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be still, for this is a holy day. Do not grieve.”
NEH.8.12	Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them.
NEH.8.13	On the second day of the month, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered around Ezra the teacher to give attention to the words of the Law. 
NEH.8.14	They found written in the Law, which the 
NEH.8.15	and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtles, palms and shade trees, to make temporary shelters”—as it is written.
NEH.8.16	So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves temporary shelters on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God and in the square by the Water Gate and the one by the Gate of Ephraim. 
NEH.8.17	The whole company that had returned from exile built temporary shelters and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. And their joy was very great.
NEH.8.18	Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the regulation, there was an assembly.
NEH.9.1	On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth and putting dust on their heads. 
NEH.9.2	Those of Israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors. 
NEH.9.3	They stood where they were and read from the Book of the Law of the 
NEH.9.4	Standing on the stairs of the Levites were Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Kenani. They cried out with loud voices to the 
NEH.9.5	And the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah—said: “Stand up and praise the 
NEH.9.5	“Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise. 
NEH.9.6	You alone are the 
NEH.9.7	“You are the 
NEH.9.8	You found his heart faithful to you, and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites and Girgashites. You have kept your promise because you are righteous.
NEH.9.9	“You saw the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt; you heard their cry at the Red Sea.
NEH.9.10	You sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his officials and all the people of his land, for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day. 
NEH.9.11	You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through it on dry ground, but you hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters. 
NEH.9.12	By day you led them with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take.
NEH.9.13	“You came down on Mount Sinai; you spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and laws that are just and right, and decrees and commands that are good. 
NEH.9.14	You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, decrees and laws through your servant Moses. 
NEH.9.15	In their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock; you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them.
NEH.9.16	“But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands. 
NEH.9.17	They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, 
NEH.9.18	even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, ‘This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,’ or when they committed awful blasphemies.
NEH.9.19	“Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take. 
NEH.9.20	You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. 
NEH.9.21	For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen.
NEH.9.22	“You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihon
NEH.9.23	You made their children as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their parents to enter and possess. 
NEH.9.24	Their children went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites, who lived in the land; you gave the Canaanites into their hands, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with them as they pleased. 
NEH.9.25	They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness.
NEH.9.26	“But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they turned their backs on your law. They killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies. 
NEH.9.27	So you delivered them into the hands of their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies.
NEH.9.28	“But as soon as they were at rest, they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and in your compassion you delivered them time after time.
NEH.9.29	“You warned them in order to turn them back to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, of which you said, ‘The person who obeys them will live by them.’ Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen. 
NEH.9.30	For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you warned them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you gave them into the hands of the neighboring peoples. 
NEH.9.31	But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.
NEH.9.32	“Now therefore, our God, the great God, mighty and awesome, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes—the hardship that has come on us, on our kings and leaders, on our priests and prophets, on our ancestors and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today. 
NEH.9.33	In all that has happened to us, you have remained righteous; you have acted faithfully, while we acted wickedly. 
NEH.9.34	Our kings, our leaders, our priests and our ancestors did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the statutes you warned them to keep. 
NEH.9.35	Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways.
NEH.9.36	“But see, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our ancestors so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces. 
NEH.9.37	Because of our sins, its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress.
NEH.9.38	“In view of all this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, our Levites and our priests are affixing their seals to it.”
NEH.10.1	Those who sealed it were:
NEH.10.1	Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah.
NEH.10.1	Zedekiah, 
NEH.10.2	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
NEH.10.3	Pashhur, Amariah, Malkijah,
NEH.10.4	Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluk,
NEH.10.5	Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
NEH.10.6	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
NEH.10.7	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
NEH.10.8	Maaziah, Bilgai and Shemaiah.
NEH.10.8	These were the priests.
NEH.10.9	The Levites:
NEH.10.9	Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel,
NEH.10.10	and their associates: Shebaniah,
NEH.10.10	Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
NEH.10.11	Mika, Rehob, Hashabiah,
NEH.10.12	Zakkur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
NEH.10.13	Hodiah, Bani and Beninu.
NEH.10.14	The leaders of the people:
NEH.10.14	Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
NEH.10.15	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
NEH.10.16	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
NEH.10.17	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
NEH.10.18	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
NEH.10.19	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
NEH.10.20	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
NEH.10.21	Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
NEH.10.22	Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
NEH.10.23	Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
NEH.10.24	Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
NEH.10.25	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
NEH.10.26	Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
NEH.10.27	Malluk, Harim and Baanah.
NEH.10.28	“The rest of the people—priests, Levites, gatekeepers, musicians, temple servants and all who separated themselves from the neighboring peoples for the sake of the Law of God, together with their wives and all their sons and daughters who are able to understand— 
NEH.10.29	all these now join their fellow Israelites the nobles, and bind themselves with a curse and an oath to follow the Law of God given through Moses the servant of God and to obey carefully all the commands, regulations and decrees of the 
NEH.10.30	“We promise not to give our daughters in marriage to the peoples around us or take their daughters for our sons.
NEH.10.31	“When the neighboring peoples bring merchandise or grain to sell on the Sabbath, we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on any holy day. Every seventh year we will forgo working the land and will cancel all debts.
NEH.10.32	“We assume the responsibility for carrying out the commands to give a third of a shekel
NEH.10.33	for the bread set out on the table; for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings; for the offerings on the Sabbaths, at the New Moon feasts and at the appointed festivals; for the holy offerings; for sin offerings
NEH.10.34	“We—the priests, the Levites and the people—have cast lots to determine when each of our families is to bring to the house of our God at set times each year a contribution of wood to burn on the altar of the 
NEH.10.35	“We also assume responsibility for bringing to the house of the 
NEH.10.36	“As it is also written in the Law, we will bring the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, of our herds and of our flocks to the house of our God, to the priests ministering there.
NEH.10.37	“Moreover, we will bring to the storerooms of the house of our God, to the priests, the first of our ground meal, of our grain offerings, of the fruit of all our trees and of our new wine and olive oil. And we will bring a tithe of our crops to the Levites, for it is the Levites who collect the tithes in all the towns where we work. 
NEH.10.38	A priest descended from Aaron is to accompany the Levites when they receive the tithes, and the Levites are to bring a tenth of the tithes up to the house of our God, to the storerooms of the treasury. 
NEH.10.39	The people of Israel, including the Levites, are to bring their contributions of grain, new wine and olive oil to the storerooms, where the articles for the sanctuary and for the ministering priests, the gatekeepers and the musicians are also kept.
NEH.10.39	“We will not neglect the house of our God.”
NEH.11.1	Now the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem. The rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten of them to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the remaining nine were to stay in their own towns. 
NEH.11.2	The people commended all who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
NEH.11.3	These are the provincial leaders who settled in Jerusalem (now some Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants and descendants of Solomon’s servants lived in the towns of Judah, each on their own property in the various towns, 
NEH.11.4	while other people from both Judah and Benjamin lived in Jerusalem):
NEH.11.4	From the descendants of Judah:
NEH.11.4	Athaiah son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, a descendant of Perez; 
NEH.11.5	and Maaseiah son of Baruch, the son of Kol-Hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, a descendant of Shelah. 
NEH.11.6	The descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem totaled 468 men of standing.
NEH.11.7	From the descendants of Benjamin:
NEH.11.7	Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah, 
NEH.11.8	and his followers, Gabbai and Sallai—928 men. 
NEH.11.9	Joel son of Zikri was their chief officer, and Judah son of Hassenuah was over the New Quarter of the city.
NEH.11.10	From the priests:
NEH.11.10	Jedaiah; the son of Joiarib; Jakin; 
NEH.11.11	Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the official in charge of the house of God, 
NEH.11.12	and their associates, who carried on work for the temple—822 men; Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malkijah, 
NEH.11.13	and his associates, who were heads of families—242 men; Amashsai son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, 
NEH.11.14	and his
NEH.11.15	From the Levites:
NEH.11.15	Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 
NEH.11.16	Shabbethai and Jozabad, two of the heads of the Levites, who had charge of the outside work of the house of God; 
NEH.11.17	Mattaniah son of Mika, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, the director who led in thanksgiving and prayer; Bakbukiah, second among his associates; and Abda son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 
NEH.11.18	The Levites in the holy city totaled 284.
NEH.11.19	The gatekeepers:
NEH.11.19	Akkub, Talmon and their associates, who kept watch at the gates—172 men.
NEH.11.20	The rest of the Israelites, with the priests and Levites, were in all the towns of Judah, each on their ancestral property.
NEH.11.21	The temple servants lived on the hill of Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of them.
NEH.11.22	The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mika. Uzzi was one of Asaph’s descendants, who were the musicians responsible for the service of the house of God. 
NEH.11.23	The musicians were under the king’s orders, which regulated their daily activity.
NEH.11.24	Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, one of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was the king’s agent in all affairs relating to the people.
NEH.11.25	As for the villages with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its surrounding settlements, in Dibon and its settlements, in Jekabzeel and its villages, 
NEH.11.26	in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth Pelet, 
NEH.11.27	in Hazar Shual, in Beersheba and its settlements, 
NEH.11.28	in Ziklag, in Mekonah and its settlements, 
NEH.11.29	in En Rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth, 
NEH.11.30	Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, in Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah and its settlements. So they were living all the way from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom.
NEH.11.31	The descendants of the Benjamites from Geba lived in Mikmash, Aija, Bethel and its settlements, 
NEH.11.32	in Anathoth, Nob and Ananiah, 
NEH.11.33	in Hazor, Ramah and Gittaim, 
NEH.11.34	in Hadid, Zeboim and Neballat, 
NEH.11.35	in Lod and Ono, and in Ge Harashim.
NEH.11.36	Some of the divisions of the Levites of Judah settled in Benjamin.
NEH.12.1	These were the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with Joshua:
NEH.12.1	Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
NEH.12.2	Amariah, Malluk, Hattush,
NEH.12.3	Shekaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
NEH.12.4	Iddo, Ginnethon,
NEH.12.5	Mijamin,
NEH.12.6	Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah and Jedaiah.
NEH.12.7	These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Joshua.
NEH.12.8	The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and also Mattaniah, who, together with his associates, was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. 
NEH.12.9	Bakbukiah and Unni, their associates, stood opposite them in the services.
NEH.12.10	Joshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim the father of Eliashib, Eliashib the father of Joiada, 
NEH.12.11	Joiada the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan the father of Jaddua.
NEH.12.12	In the days of Joiakim, these were the heads of the priestly families:
NEH.12.12	of Seraiah’s family, Meraiah;
NEH.12.12	of Jeremiah’s, Hananiah;
NEH.12.13	of Ezra’s, Meshullam;
NEH.12.13	of Amariah’s, Jehohanan;
NEH.12.14	of Malluk’s, Jonathan;
NEH.12.14	of Shekaniah’s,
NEH.12.15	of Harim’s, Adna;
NEH.12.15	of Meremoth’s,
NEH.12.16	of Iddo’s, Zechariah;
NEH.12.16	of Ginnethon’s, Meshullam;
NEH.12.17	of Abijah’s, Zikri;
NEH.12.17	of Miniamin’s and of Moadiah’s, Piltai;
NEH.12.18	of Bilgah’s, Shammua;
NEH.12.18	of Shemaiah’s, Jehonathan;
NEH.12.19	of Joiarib’s, Mattenai;
NEH.12.19	of Jedaiah’s, Uzzi;
NEH.12.20	of Sallu’s, Kallai;
NEH.12.20	of Amok’s, Eber;
NEH.12.21	of Hilkiah’s, Hashabiah;
NEH.12.21	of Jedaiah’s, Nethanel.
NEH.12.22	The family heads of the Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua, as well as those of the priests, were recorded in the reign of Darius the Persian. 
NEH.12.23	The family heads among the descendants of Levi up to the time of Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded in the book of the annals. 
NEH.12.24	And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their associates, who stood opposite them to give praise and thanksgiving, one section responding to the other, as prescribed by David the man of God.
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates. 
NEH.12.26	They served in the days of Joiakim son of Joshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest, the teacher of the Law.
NEH.12.27	At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from where they lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps and lyres. 
NEH.12.28	The musicians also were brought together from the region around Jerusalem—from the villages of the Netophathites, 
NEH.12.29	from Beth Gilgal, and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth, for the musicians had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially, they purified the people, the gates and the wall.
NEH.12.31	I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of
NEH.12.32	Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them, 
NEH.12.33	along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	as well as some priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zakkur, the son of Asaph, 
NEH.12.36	and his associates—Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani—with musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the teacher of the Law led the procession. 
NEH.12.37	At the Fountain Gate they continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the site of David’s palace to the Water Gate on the east.
NEH.12.38	The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them on top of
NEH.12.39	over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah
NEH.12.40	The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God; so did I, together with half the officials, 
NEH.12.41	as well as the priests—Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah with their trumpets— 
NEH.12.42	and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam and Ezer. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah. 
NEH.12.43	And on that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away.
NEH.12.44	At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites. 
NEH.12.45	They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did also the musicians and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon. 
NEH.12.46	For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the musicians and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
NEH.12.47	So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.
NEH.13.1	On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God, 
NEH.13.2	because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into a blessing.) 
NEH.13.3	When the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent.
NEH.13.4	Before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah, 
NEH.13.5	and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles, and also the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil prescribed for the Levites, musicians and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests.
NEH.13.6	But while all this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later I asked his permission 
NEH.13.7	and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God. 
NEH.13.8	I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah’s household goods out of the room. 
NEH.13.9	I gave orders to purify the rooms, and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the incense.
NEH.13.10	I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them, and that all the Levites and musicians responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields. 
NEH.13.11	So I rebuked the officials and asked them, “Why is the house of God neglected?” Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts.
NEH.13.12	All Judah brought the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil into the storerooms. 
NEH.13.13	I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zakkur, the son of Mattaniah, their assistant, because they were considered trustworthy. They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites.
NEH.13.14	Remember me for this, my God, and do not blot out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services.
NEH.13.15	In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, together with wine, grapes, figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day. 
NEH.13.16	People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people of Judah. 
NEH.13.17	I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this wicked thing you are doing—desecrating the Sabbath day? 
NEH.13.18	Didn’t your ancestors do the same things, so that our God brought all this calamity on us and on this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath.”
NEH.13.19	When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day. 
NEH.13.20	Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.21	But I warned them and said, “Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will arrest you.” From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath. 
NEH.13.22	Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.
NEH.13.22	Remember me for this also, my God, and show mercy to me according to your great love.
NEH.13.23	Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab. 
NEH.13.24	Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language of Judah. 
NEH.13.25	I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God’s name and said: “You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves. 
NEH.13.26	Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women. 
NEH.13.27	Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?”
NEH.13.28	One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. And I drove him away from me.
NEH.13.29	Remember them, my God, because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
NEH.13.30	So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned them duties, each to his own task. 
NEH.13.31	I also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times, and for the firstfruits.
NEH.13.31	Remember me with favor, my God.
EST.1.1	This is what happened during the time of Xerxes,
EST.1.2	At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa, 
EST.1.3	and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present.
EST.1.4	For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty. 
EST.1.5	When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in the enclosed garden of the king’s palace, for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa. 
EST.1.6	The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones. 
EST.1.7	Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king’s liberality. 
EST.1.8	By the king’s command each guest was allowed to drink with no restrictions, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.
EST.1.9	Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Karkas— 
EST.1.11	to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at. 
EST.1.12	But when the attendants delivered the king’s command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger.
EST.1.13	Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times 
EST.1.14	and were closest to the king—Karshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memukan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.
EST.1.15	“According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?” he asked. “She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her.”
EST.1.16	Then Memukan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, “Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes. 
EST.1.17	For the queen’s conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, ‘King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.’ 
EST.1.18	This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen’s conduct will respond to all the king’s nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.
EST.1.19	“Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she. 
EST.1.20	Then when the king’s edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest.”
EST.1.21	The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memukan proposed. 
EST.1.22	He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, proclaiming that every man should be ruler over his own household, using his native tongue.
EST.2.1	Later when King Xerxes’ fury had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her. 
EST.2.2	Then the king’s personal attendants proposed, “Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king. 
EST.2.3	Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be given to them. 
EST.2.4	Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it.
EST.2.5	Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, 
EST.2.6	who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jehoiachin
EST.2.7	Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This young woman, who was also known as Esther, had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.
EST.2.8	When the king’s order and edict had been proclaimed, many young women were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king’s palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem. 
EST.2.9	She pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven female attendants selected from the king’s palace and moved her and her attendants into the best place in the harem.
EST.2.10	Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so. 
EST.2.11	Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.
EST.2.12	Before a young woman’s turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics. 
EST.2.13	And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace. 
EST.2.14	In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.
EST.2.15	When the turn came for Esther (the young woman Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her. 
EST.2.16	She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
EST.2.17	Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	And the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.
EST.2.19	When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate. 
EST.2.20	But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai’s instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up.
EST.2.21	During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthana
EST.2.22	But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai. 
EST.2.23	And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were impaled on poles. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king.
EST.3.1	After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles. 
EST.3.2	All the royal officials at the king’s gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor.
EST.3.3	Then the royal officials at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?” 
EST.3.4	Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai’s behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.
EST.3.5	When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged. 
EST.3.6	Yet having learned who Mordecai’s people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai’s people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.
EST.3.7	In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, the 
EST.3.8	Then Haman said to King Xerxes, “There is a certain people dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom who keep themselves separate. Their customs are different from those of all other people, and they do not obey the king’s laws; it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them. 
EST.3.9	If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will give ten thousand talents
EST.3.10	So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. 
EST.3.11	“Keep the money,” the king said to Haman, “and do with the people as you please.”
EST.3.12	Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman’s orders to the king’s satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring. 
EST.3.13	Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews—young and old, women and children—on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. 
EST.3.14	A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day.
EST.3.15	The couriers went out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered.
EST.4.1	When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly. 
EST.4.2	But he went only as far as the king’s gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it. 
EST.4.3	In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
EST.4.4	When Esther’s eunuchs and female attendants came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. 
EST.4.5	Then Esther summoned Hathak, one of the king’s eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.
EST.4.6	So Hathak went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king’s gate. 
EST.4.7	Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews. 
EST.4.8	He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to instruct her to go into the king’s presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.
EST.4.9	Hathak went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said. 
EST.4.10	Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai, 
EST.4.11	“All the king’s officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law: that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them and spares their lives. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king.”
EST.4.12	When Esther’s words were reported to Mordecai, 
EST.4.13	he sent back this answer: “Do not think that because you are in the king’s house you alone of all the Jews will escape. 
EST.4.14	For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?”
EST.4.15	Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: 
EST.4.16	“Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.”
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther’s instructions.
EST.5.1	On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance. 
EST.5.2	When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
EST.5.3	Then the king asked, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you.”
EST.5.4	“If it pleases the king,” replied Esther, “let the king, together with Haman, come today to a banquet I have prepared for him.”
EST.5.5	“Bring Haman at once,” the king said, “so that we may do what Esther asks.”
EST.5.5	So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared. 
EST.5.6	As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther, “Now what is your petition? It will be given you. And what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.”
EST.5.7	Esther replied, “My petition and my request is this: 
EST.5.8	If the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king’s question.”
EST.5.9	Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the king’s gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence, he was filled with rage against Mordecai. 
EST.5.10	Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home.
EST.5.10	Calling together his friends and Zeresh, his wife, 
EST.5.11	Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials. 
EST.5.12	“And that’s not all,” Haman added. “I’m the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she has invited me along with the king tomorrow. 
EST.5.13	But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king’s gate.”
EST.5.14	His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a pole set up, reaching to a height of fifty cubits,
EST.6.1	That night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him. 
EST.6.2	It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
EST.6.3	“What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?” the king asked.
EST.6.3	“Nothing has been done for him,” his attendants answered.
EST.6.4	The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about impaling Mordecai on the pole he had set up for him.
EST.6.5	His attendants answered, “Haman is standing in the court.”
EST.6.5	“Bring him in,” the king ordered.
EST.6.6	When Haman entered, the king asked him, “What should be done for the man the king delights to honor?”
EST.6.6	Now Haman thought to himself, “Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?” 
EST.6.7	So he answered the king, “For the man the king delights to honor, 
EST.6.8	have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head. 
EST.6.9	Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!’ ”
EST.6.10	“Go at once,” the king commanded Haman. “Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended.”
EST.6.11	So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, “This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!”
EST.6.12	Afterward Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief, 
EST.6.13	and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him.
EST.6.13	His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, “Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him—you will surely come to ruin!” 
EST.6.14	While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther’s banquet, 
EST.7.2	and as they were drinking wine on the second day, the king again asked, “Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.”
EST.7.3	Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my life—this is my petition. And spare my people—this is my request. 
EST.7.4	For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king.
EST.7.5	King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, “Who is he? Where is he—the man who has dared to do such a thing?”
EST.7.6	Esther said, “An adversary and enemy! This vile Haman!”
EST.7.6	Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen. 
EST.7.7	The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.
EST.7.8	Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining.
EST.7.8	The king exclaimed, “Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?”
EST.7.8	As soon as the word left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. 
EST.7.9	Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, “A pole reaching to a height of fifty cubits
EST.7.9	The king said, “Impale him on it!” 
EST.7.10	So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai. Then the king’s fury subsided.
EST.8.1	That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her. 
EST.8.2	The king took off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Haman’s estate.
EST.8.3	Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him.
EST.8.5	“If it pleases the king,” she said, “and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces. 
EST.8.6	For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family?”
EST.8.7	King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Because Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have impaled him on the pole he set up. 
EST.8.8	Now write another decree in the king’s name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with the king’s signet ring—for no document written in the king’s name and sealed with his ring can be revoked.”
EST.8.9	At once the royal secretaries were summoned—on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai’s orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush.
EST.8.10	Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the king’s signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king.
EST.8.11	The king’s edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate the armed men of any nationality or province who might attack them and their women and children,
EST.8.12	The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. 
EST.8.13	A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
EST.8.14	The couriers, riding the royal horses, went out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa.
EST.8.15	When Mordecai left the king’s presence, he was wearing royal garments of blue and white, a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa held a joyous celebration. 
EST.8.16	For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor. 
EST.8.17	In every province and in every city to which the edict of the king came, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them.
EST.9.1	On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them. 
EST.9.2	The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those determined to destroy them. No one could stand against them, because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them. 
EST.9.3	And all the nobles of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and the king’s administrators helped the Jews, because fear of Mordecai had seized them. 
EST.9.4	Mordecai was prominent in the palace; his reputation spread throughout the provinces, and he became more and more powerful.
EST.9.5	The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did what they pleased to those who hated them. 
EST.9.6	In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. 
EST.9.7	They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha, 
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
EST.9.11	The number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day. 
EST.9.12	The king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? It will also be granted.”
EST.9.13	“If it pleases the king,” Esther answered, “give the Jews in Susa permission to carry out this day’s edict tomorrow also, and let Haman’s ten sons be impaled on poles.”
EST.9.14	So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa, and they impaled the ten sons of Haman. 
EST.9.15	The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they put to death in Susa three hundred men, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
EST.9.16	Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of them but did not lay their hands on the plunder. 
EST.9.17	This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
EST.9.18	The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth, and then on the fifteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
EST.9.19	That is why rural Jews—those living in villages—observe the fourteenth of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for giving presents to each other.
EST.9.20	Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far, 
EST.9.21	to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar 
EST.9.22	as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration. He wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor.
EST.9.23	So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them. 
EST.9.24	For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the 
EST.9.25	But when the plot came to the king’s attention,
EST.9.26	(Therefore these days were called Purim, from the word 
EST.9.27	the Jews took it on themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who join them should without fail observe these two days every year, in the way prescribed and at the time appointed. 
EST.9.28	These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family, and in every province and in every city. And these days of Purim should never fail to be celebrated by the Jews—nor should the memory of these days die out among their descendants.
EST.9.29	So Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim. 
EST.9.30	And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of Xerxes’ kingdom—words of goodwill and assurance— 
EST.9.31	to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation. 
EST.9.32	Esther’s decree confirmed these regulations about Purim, and it was written down in the records.
EST.10.1	King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire, to its distant shores. 
EST.10.2	And all his acts of power and might, together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king had promoted, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia? 
EST.10.3	Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Xerxes, preeminent among the Jews, and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews, because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews.
JOB.1.1	In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. 
JOB.1.2	He had seven sons and three daughters, 
JOB.1.3	and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
JOB.1.4	His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 
JOB.1.5	When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom.
JOB.1.6	One day the angels
JOB.1.7	The 
JOB.1.7	Satan answered the 
JOB.1.8	Then the 
JOB.1.9	“Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied. 
JOB.1.10	“Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 
JOB.1.11	But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.”
JOB.1.12	The 
JOB.1.12	Then Satan went out from the presence of the 
JOB.1.13	One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.14	a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, 
JOB.1.15	and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.16	While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.17	While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.18	While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, “Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.19	when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.20	At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship 
JOB.1.21	and said:
JOB.1.21	“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
JOB.1.21	and naked I will depart.
JOB.1.21	The 
JOB.1.21	may the name of the 
JOB.1.22	In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
JOB.2.1	On another day the angels
JOB.2.2	And the 
JOB.2.2	Satan answered the 
JOB.2.3	Then the 
JOB.2.4	“Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life. 
JOB.2.5	But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.”
JOB.2.6	The 
JOB.2.7	So Satan went out from the presence of the 
JOB.2.8	Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
JOB.2.9	His wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”
JOB.2.10	He replied, “You are talking like a foolish
JOB.2.10	In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
JOB.2.11	When Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him. 
JOB.2.12	When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads. 
JOB.2.13	Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.
JOB.3.1	After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. 
JOB.3.2	He said:
JOB.3.3	“May the day of my birth perish,
JOB.3.3	and the night that said, ‘A boy is conceived!’
JOB.3.4	That day—may it turn to darkness;
JOB.3.4	may God above not care about it;
JOB.3.4	may no light shine on it.
JOB.3.5	May gloom and utter darkness claim it once more;
JOB.3.5	may a cloud settle over it;
JOB.3.5	may blackness overwhelm it.
JOB.3.6	That night—may thick darkness seize it;
JOB.3.6	may it not be included among the days of the year
JOB.3.6	nor be entered in any of the months.
JOB.3.7	May that night be barren;
JOB.3.7	may no shout of joy be heard in it.
JOB.3.8	May those who curse days
JOB.3.8	those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
JOB.3.9	May its morning stars become dark;
JOB.3.9	may it wait for daylight in vain
JOB.3.9	and not see the first rays of dawn,
JOB.3.10	for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me
JOB.3.10	to hide trouble from my eyes.
JOB.3.11	“Why did I not perish at birth,
JOB.3.11	and die as I came from the womb?
JOB.3.12	Why were there knees to receive me
JOB.3.12	and breasts that I might be nursed?
JOB.3.13	For now I would be lying down in peace;
JOB.3.13	I would be asleep and at rest
JOB.3.14	with kings and rulers of the earth,
JOB.3.14	who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,
JOB.3.15	with princes who had gold,
JOB.3.15	who filled their houses with silver.
JOB.3.16	Or why was I not hidden away in the ground like a stillborn child,
JOB.3.16	like an infant who never saw the light of day?
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease from turmoil,
JOB.3.17	and there the weary are at rest.
JOB.3.18	Captives also enjoy their ease;
JOB.3.18	they no longer hear the slave driver’s shout.
JOB.3.19	The small and the great are there,
JOB.3.19	and the slaves are freed from their owners.
JOB.3.20	“Why is light given to those in misery,
JOB.3.20	and life to the bitter of soul,
JOB.3.21	to those who long for death that does not come,
JOB.3.21	who search for it more than for hidden treasure,
JOB.3.22	who are filled with gladness
JOB.3.22	and rejoice when they reach the grave?
JOB.3.23	Why is life given to a man
JOB.3.23	whose way is hidden,
JOB.3.23	whom God has hedged in?
JOB.3.24	For sighing has become my daily food;
JOB.3.24	my groans pour out like water.
JOB.3.25	What I feared has come upon me;
JOB.3.25	what I dreaded has happened to me.
JOB.3.26	I have no peace, no quietness;
JOB.3.26	I have no rest, but only turmoil.”
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
JOB.4.2	“If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient?
JOB.4.2	But who can keep from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Think how you have instructed many,
JOB.4.3	how you have strengthened feeble hands.
JOB.4.4	Your words have supported those who stumbled;
JOB.4.4	you have strengthened faltering knees.
JOB.4.5	But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged;
JOB.4.5	it strikes you, and you are dismayed.
JOB.4.6	Should not your piety be your confidence
JOB.4.6	and your blameless ways your hope?
JOB.4.7	“Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished?
JOB.4.7	Where were the upright ever destroyed?
JOB.4.8	As I have observed, those who plow evil
JOB.4.8	and those who sow trouble reap it.
JOB.4.9	At the breath of God they perish;
JOB.4.9	at the blast of his anger they are no more.
JOB.4.10	The lions may roar and growl,
JOB.4.10	yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.
JOB.4.11	The lion perishes for lack of prey,
JOB.4.11	and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
JOB.4.12	“A word was secretly brought to me,
JOB.4.12	my ears caught a whisper of it.
JOB.4.13	Amid disquieting dreams in the night,
JOB.4.13	when deep sleep falls on people,
JOB.4.14	fear and trembling seized me
JOB.4.14	and made all my bones shake.
JOB.4.15	A spirit glided past my face,
JOB.4.15	and the hair on my body stood on end.
JOB.4.16	It stopped,
JOB.4.16	but I could not tell what it was.
JOB.4.16	A form stood before my eyes,
JOB.4.16	and I heard a hushed voice:
JOB.4.17	‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God?
JOB.4.17	Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker?
JOB.4.18	If God places no trust in his servants,
JOB.4.18	if he charges his angels with error,
JOB.4.19	how much more those who live in houses of clay,
JOB.4.19	whose foundations are in the dust,
JOB.4.19	who are crushed more readily than a moth!
JOB.4.20	Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces;
JOB.4.20	unnoticed, they perish forever.
JOB.4.21	Are not the cords of their tent pulled up,
JOB.4.21	so that they die without wisdom?’
JOB.5.1	“Call if you will, but who will answer you?
JOB.5.1	To which of the holy ones will you turn?
JOB.5.2	Resentment kills a fool,
JOB.5.2	and envy slays the simple.
JOB.5.3	I myself have seen a fool taking root,
JOB.5.3	but suddenly his house was cursed.
JOB.5.4	His children are far from safety,
JOB.5.4	crushed in court without a defender.
JOB.5.5	The hungry consume his harvest,
JOB.5.5	taking it even from among thorns,
JOB.5.5	and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
JOB.5.6	For hardship does not spring from the soil,
JOB.5.6	nor does trouble sprout from the ground.
JOB.5.7	Yet man is born to trouble
JOB.5.7	as surely as sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	“But if I were you, I would appeal to God;
JOB.5.8	I would lay my cause before him.
JOB.5.9	He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed,
JOB.5.9	miracles that cannot be counted.
JOB.5.10	He provides rain for the earth;
JOB.5.10	he sends water on the countryside.
JOB.5.11	The lowly he sets on high,
JOB.5.11	and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
JOB.5.12	He thwarts the plans of the crafty,
JOB.5.12	so that their hands achieve no success.
JOB.5.13	He catches the wise in their craftiness,
JOB.5.13	and the schemes of the wily are swept away.
JOB.5.14	Darkness comes upon them in the daytime;
JOB.5.14	at noon they grope as in the night.
JOB.5.15	He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth;
JOB.5.15	he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.
JOB.5.16	So the poor have hope,
JOB.5.16	and injustice shuts its mouth.
JOB.5.17	“Blessed is the one whom God corrects;
JOB.5.17	so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
JOB.5.18	For he wounds, but he also binds up;
JOB.5.18	he injures, but his hands also heal.
JOB.5.19	From six calamities he will rescue you;
JOB.5.19	in seven no harm will touch you.
JOB.5.20	In famine he will deliver you from death,
JOB.5.20	and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
JOB.5.21	You will be protected from the lash of the tongue,
JOB.5.21	and need not fear when destruction comes.
JOB.5.22	You will laugh at destruction and famine,
JOB.5.22	and need not fear the wild animals.
JOB.5.23	For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field,
JOB.5.23	and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
JOB.5.24	You will know that your tent is secure;
JOB.5.24	you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
JOB.5.25	You will know that your children will be many,
JOB.5.25	and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	You will come to the grave in full vigor,
JOB.5.26	like sheaves gathered in season.
JOB.5.27	“We have examined this, and it is true.
JOB.5.27	So hear it and apply it to yourself.”
JOB.6.1	Then Job replied:
JOB.6.2	“If only my anguish could be weighed
JOB.6.2	and all my misery be placed on the scales!
JOB.6.3	It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas—
JOB.6.3	no wonder my words have been impetuous.
JOB.6.4	The arrows of the Almighty are in me,
JOB.6.4	my spirit drinks in their poison;
JOB.6.4	God’s terrors are marshaled against me.
JOB.6.5	Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass,
JOB.6.5	or an ox bellow when it has fodder?
JOB.6.6	Is tasteless food eaten without salt,
JOB.6.6	or is there flavor in the sap of the mallow
JOB.6.7	I refuse to touch it;
JOB.6.7	such food makes me ill.
JOB.6.8	“Oh, that I might have my request,
JOB.6.8	that God would grant what I hope for,
JOB.6.9	that God would be willing to crush me,
JOB.6.9	to let loose his hand and cut off my life!
JOB.6.10	Then I would still have this consolation—
JOB.6.10	my joy in unrelenting pain—
JOB.6.10	that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	“What strength do I have, that I should still hope?
JOB.6.11	What prospects, that I should be patient?
JOB.6.12	Do I have the strength of stone?
JOB.6.12	Is my flesh bronze?
JOB.6.13	Do I have any power to help myself,
JOB.6.13	now that success has been driven from me?
JOB.6.14	“Anyone who withholds kindness from a friend
JOB.6.14	forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams,
JOB.6.15	as the streams that overflow
JOB.6.16	when darkened by thawing ice
JOB.6.16	and swollen with melting snow,
JOB.6.17	but that stop flowing in the dry season,
JOB.6.17	and in the heat vanish from their channels.
JOB.6.18	Caravans turn aside from their routes;
JOB.6.18	they go off into the wasteland and perish.
JOB.6.19	The caravans of Tema look for water,
JOB.6.19	the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.
JOB.6.20	They are distressed, because they had been confident;
JOB.6.20	they arrive there, only to be disappointed.
JOB.6.21	Now you too have proved to be of no help;
JOB.6.21	you see something dreadful and are afraid.
JOB.6.22	Have I ever said, ‘Give something on my behalf,
JOB.6.22	pay a ransom for me from your wealth,
JOB.6.23	deliver me from the hand of the enemy,
JOB.6.23	rescue me from the clutches of the ruthless’?
JOB.6.24	“Teach me, and I will be quiet;
JOB.6.24	show me where I have been wrong.
JOB.6.25	How painful are honest words!
JOB.6.25	But what do your arguments prove?
JOB.6.26	Do you mean to correct what I say,
JOB.6.26	and treat my desperate words as wind?
JOB.6.27	You would even cast lots for the fatherless
JOB.6.27	and barter away your friend.
JOB.6.28	“But now be so kind as to look at me.
JOB.6.28	Would I lie to your face?
JOB.6.29	Relent, do not be unjust;
JOB.6.29	reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.
JOB.6.30	Is there any wickedness on my lips?
JOB.6.30	Can my mouth not discern malice?
JOB.7.1	“Do not mortals have hard service on earth?
JOB.7.1	Are not their days like those of hired laborers?
JOB.7.2	Like a slave longing for the evening shadows,
JOB.7.2	or a hired laborer waiting to be paid,
JOB.7.3	so I have been allotted months of futility,
JOB.7.3	and nights of misery have been assigned to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down I think, ‘How long before I get up?’
JOB.7.4	The night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.
JOB.7.5	My body is clothed with worms and scabs,
JOB.7.5	my skin is broken and festering.
JOB.7.6	“My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,
JOB.7.6	and they come to an end without hope.
JOB.7.7	Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath;
JOB.7.7	my eyes will never see happiness again.
JOB.7.8	The eye that now sees me will see me no longer;
JOB.7.8	you will look for me, but I will be no more.
JOB.7.9	As a cloud vanishes and is gone,
JOB.7.9	so one who goes down to the grave does not return.
JOB.7.10	He will never come to his house again;
JOB.7.10	his place will know him no more.
JOB.7.11	“Therefore I will not keep silent;
JOB.7.11	I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit,
JOB.7.11	I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.7.12	Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep,
JOB.7.12	that you put me under guard?
JOB.7.13	When I think my bed will comfort me
JOB.7.13	and my couch will ease my complaint,
JOB.7.14	even then you frighten me with dreams
JOB.7.14	and terrify me with visions,
JOB.7.15	so that I prefer strangling and death,
JOB.7.15	rather than this body of mine.
JOB.7.16	I despise my life; I would not live forever.
JOB.7.16	Let me alone; my days have no meaning.
JOB.7.17	“What is mankind that you make so much of them,
JOB.7.17	that you give them so much attention,
JOB.7.18	that you examine them every morning
JOB.7.18	and test them every moment?
JOB.7.19	Will you never look away from me,
JOB.7.19	or let me alone even for an instant?
JOB.7.20	If I have sinned, what have I done to you,
JOB.7.20	you who see everything we do?
JOB.7.20	Why have you made me your target?
JOB.7.20	Have I become a burden to you?
JOB.7.21	Why do you not pardon my offenses
JOB.7.21	and forgive my sins?
JOB.7.21	For I will soon lie down in the dust;
JOB.7.21	you will search for me, but I will be no more.”
JOB.8.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
JOB.8.2	“How long will you say such things?
JOB.8.2	Your words are a blustering wind.
JOB.8.3	Does God pervert justice?
JOB.8.3	Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
JOB.8.4	When your children sinned against him,
JOB.8.4	he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
JOB.8.5	But if you will seek God earnestly
JOB.8.5	and plead with the Almighty,
JOB.8.6	if you are pure and upright,
JOB.8.6	even now he will rouse himself on your behalf
JOB.8.6	and restore you to your prosperous state.
JOB.8.7	Your beginnings will seem humble,
JOB.8.7	so prosperous will your future be.
JOB.8.8	“Ask the former generation
JOB.8.8	and find out what their ancestors learned,
JOB.8.9	for we were born only yesterday and know nothing,
JOB.8.9	and our days on earth are but a shadow.
JOB.8.10	Will they not instruct you and tell you?
JOB.8.10	Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?
JOB.8.11	Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh?
JOB.8.11	Can reeds thrive without water?
JOB.8.12	While still growing and uncut,
JOB.8.12	they wither more quickly than grass.
JOB.8.13	Such is the destiny of all who forget God;
JOB.8.13	so perishes the hope of the godless.
JOB.8.14	What they trust in is fragile
JOB.8.14	what they rely on is a spider’s web.
JOB.8.15	They lean on the web, but it gives way;
JOB.8.15	they cling to it, but it does not hold.
JOB.8.16	They are like a well-watered plant in the sunshine,
JOB.8.16	spreading its shoots over the garden;
JOB.8.17	it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks
JOB.8.17	and looks for a place among the stones.
JOB.8.18	But when it is torn from its spot,
JOB.8.18	that place disowns it and says, ‘I never saw you.’
JOB.8.19	Surely its life withers away,
JOB.8.19	and
JOB.8.20	“Surely God does not reject one who is blameless
JOB.8.20	or strengthen the hands of evildoers.
JOB.8.21	He will yet fill your mouth with laughter
JOB.8.21	and your lips with shouts of joy.
JOB.8.22	Your enemies will be clothed in shame,
JOB.8.22	and the tents of the wicked will be no more.”
JOB.9.1	Then Job replied:
JOB.9.2	“Indeed, I know that this is true.
JOB.9.2	But how can mere mortals prove their innocence before God?
JOB.9.3	Though they wished to dispute with him,
JOB.9.3	they could not answer him one time out of a thousand.
JOB.9.4	His wisdom is profound, his power is vast.
JOB.9.4	Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?
JOB.9.5	He moves mountains without their knowing it
JOB.9.5	and overturns them in his anger.
JOB.9.6	He shakes the earth from its place
JOB.9.6	and makes its pillars tremble.
JOB.9.7	He speaks to the sun and it does not shine;
JOB.9.7	he seals off the light of the stars.
JOB.9.8	He alone stretches out the heavens
JOB.9.8	and treads on the waves of the sea.
JOB.9.9	He is the Maker of the Bear
JOB.9.9	the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
JOB.9.10	He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed,
JOB.9.10	miracles that cannot be counted.
JOB.9.11	When he passes me, I cannot see him;
JOB.9.11	when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
JOB.9.12	If he snatches away, who can stop him?
JOB.9.12	Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’
JOB.9.13	God does not restrain his anger;
JOB.9.13	even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.
JOB.9.14	“How then can I dispute with him?
JOB.9.14	How can I find words to argue with him?
JOB.9.15	Though I were innocent, I could not answer him;
JOB.9.15	I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.
JOB.9.16	Even if I summoned him and he responded,
JOB.9.16	I do not believe he would give me a hearing.
JOB.9.17	He would crush me with a storm
JOB.9.17	and multiply my wounds for no reason.
JOB.9.18	He would not let me catch my breath
JOB.9.18	but would overwhelm me with misery.
JOB.9.19	If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty!
JOB.9.19	And if it is a matter of justice, who can challenge him
JOB.9.20	Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me;
JOB.9.20	if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.
JOB.9.21	“Although I am blameless,
JOB.9.21	I have no concern for myself;
JOB.9.21	I despise my own life.
JOB.9.22	It is all the same; that is why I say,
JOB.9.22	‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’
JOB.9.23	When a scourge brings sudden death,
JOB.9.23	he mocks the despair of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	When a land falls into the hands of the wicked,
JOB.9.24	he blindfolds its judges.
JOB.9.24	If it is not he, then who is it?
JOB.9.25	“My days are swifter than a runner;
JOB.9.25	they fly away without a glimpse of joy.
JOB.9.26	They skim past like boats of papyrus,
JOB.9.26	like eagles swooping down on their prey.
JOB.9.27	If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
JOB.9.27	I will change my expression, and smile,’
JOB.9.28	I still dread all my sufferings,
JOB.9.28	for I know you will not hold me innocent.
JOB.9.29	Since I am already found guilty,
JOB.9.29	why should I struggle in vain?
JOB.9.30	Even if I washed myself with soap
JOB.9.30	and my hands with cleansing powder,
JOB.9.31	you would plunge me into a slime pit
JOB.9.31	so that even my clothes would detest me.
JOB.9.32	“He is not a mere mortal like me that I might answer him,
JOB.9.32	that we might confront each other in court.
JOB.9.33	If only there were someone to mediate between us,
JOB.9.33	someone to bring us together,
JOB.9.34	someone to remove God’s rod from me,
JOB.9.34	so that his terror would frighten me no more.
JOB.9.35	Then I would speak up without fear of him,
JOB.9.35	but as it now stands with me, I cannot.
JOB.10.1	“I loathe my very life;
JOB.10.1	therefore I will give free rein to my complaint
JOB.10.1	and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I say to God: Do not declare me guilty,
JOB.10.2	but tell me what charges you have against me.
JOB.10.3	Does it please you to oppress me,
JOB.10.3	to spurn the work of your hands,
JOB.10.3	while you smile on the plans of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Do you have eyes of flesh?
JOB.10.4	Do you see as a mortal sees?
JOB.10.5	Are your days like those of a mortal
JOB.10.5	or your years like those of a strong man,
JOB.10.6	that you must search out my faults
JOB.10.6	and probe after my sin—
JOB.10.7	though you know that I am not guilty
JOB.10.7	and that no one can rescue me from your hand?
JOB.10.8	“Your hands shaped me and made me.
JOB.10.8	Will you now turn and destroy me?
JOB.10.9	Remember that you molded me like clay.
JOB.10.9	Will you now turn me to dust again?
JOB.10.10	Did you not pour me out like milk
JOB.10.10	and curdle me like cheese,
JOB.10.11	clothe me with skin and flesh
JOB.10.11	and knit me together with bones and sinews?
JOB.10.12	You gave me life and showed me kindness,
JOB.10.12	and in your providence watched over my spirit.
JOB.10.13	“But this is what you concealed in your heart,
JOB.10.13	and I know that this was in your mind:
JOB.10.14	If I sinned, you would be watching me
JOB.10.14	and would not let my offense go unpunished.
JOB.10.15	If I am guilty—woe to me!
JOB.10.15	Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head,
JOB.10.15	for I am full of shame
JOB.10.15	and drowned in
JOB.10.16	If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion
JOB.10.16	and again display your awesome power against me.
JOB.10.17	You bring new witnesses against me
JOB.10.17	and increase your anger toward me;
JOB.10.17	your forces come against me wave upon wave.
JOB.10.18	“Why then did you bring me out of the womb?
JOB.10.18	I wish I had died before any eye saw me.
JOB.10.19	If only I had never come into being,
JOB.10.19	or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!
JOB.10.20	Are not my few days almost over?
JOB.10.20	Turn away from me so I can have a moment’s joy
JOB.10.21	before I go to the place of no return,
JOB.10.21	to the land of gloom and utter darkness,
JOB.10.22	to the land of deepest night,
JOB.10.22	of utter darkness and disorder,
JOB.10.22	where even the light is like darkness.”
JOB.11.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
JOB.11.2	“Are all these words to go unanswered?
JOB.11.2	Is this talker to be vindicated?
JOB.11.3	Will your idle talk reduce others to silence?
JOB.11.3	Will no one rebuke you when you mock?
JOB.11.4	You say to God, ‘My beliefs are flawless
JOB.11.4	and I am pure in your sight.’
JOB.11.5	Oh, how I wish that God would speak,
JOB.11.5	that he would open his lips against you
JOB.11.6	and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom,
JOB.11.6	for true wisdom has two sides.
JOB.11.6	Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.
JOB.11.7	“Can you fathom the mysteries of God?
JOB.11.7	Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
JOB.11.8	They are higher than the heavens above—what can you do?
JOB.11.8	They are deeper than the depths below—what can you know?
JOB.11.9	Their measure is longer than the earth
JOB.11.9	and wider than the sea.
JOB.11.10	“If he comes along and confines you in prison
JOB.11.10	and convenes a court, who can oppose him?
JOB.11.11	Surely he recognizes deceivers;
JOB.11.11	and when he sees evil, does he not take note?
JOB.11.12	But the witless can no more become wise
JOB.11.12	than a wild donkey’s colt can be born human.
JOB.11.13	“Yet if you devote your heart to him
JOB.11.13	and stretch out your hands to him,
JOB.11.14	if you put away the sin that is in your hand
JOB.11.14	and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,
JOB.11.15	then, free of fault, you will lift up your face;
JOB.11.15	you will stand firm and without fear.
JOB.11.16	You will surely forget your trouble,
JOB.11.16	recalling it only as waters gone by.
JOB.11.17	Life will be brighter than noonday,
JOB.11.17	and darkness will become like morning.
JOB.11.18	You will be secure, because there is hope;
JOB.11.18	you will look about you and take your rest in safety.
JOB.11.19	You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid,
JOB.11.19	and many will court your favor.
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked will fail,
JOB.11.20	and escape will elude them;
JOB.11.20	their hope will become a dying gasp.”
JOB.12.1	Then Job replied:
JOB.12.2	“Doubtless you are the only people who matter,
JOB.12.2	and wisdom will die with you!
JOB.12.3	But I have a mind as well as you;
JOB.12.3	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.12.3	Who does not know all these things?
JOB.12.4	“I have become a laughingstock to my friends,
JOB.12.4	though I called on God and he answered—
JOB.12.4	a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!
JOB.12.5	Those who are at ease have contempt for misfortune
JOB.12.5	as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
JOB.12.6	The tents of marauders are undisturbed,
JOB.12.6	and those who provoke God are secure—
JOB.12.6	those God has in his hand.
JOB.12.7	“But ask the animals, and they will teach you,
JOB.12.7	or the birds in the sky, and they will tell you;
JOB.12.8	or speak to the earth, and it will teach you,
JOB.12.8	or let the fish in the sea inform you.
JOB.12.9	Which of all these does not know
JOB.12.9	that the hand of the 
JOB.12.10	In his hand is the life of every creature
JOB.12.10	and the breath of all mankind.
JOB.12.11	Does not the ear test words
JOB.12.11	as the tongue tastes food?
JOB.12.12	Is not wisdom found among the aged?
JOB.12.12	Does not long life bring understanding?
JOB.12.13	“To God belong wisdom and power;
JOB.12.13	counsel and understanding are his.
JOB.12.14	What he tears down cannot be rebuilt;
JOB.12.14	those he imprisons cannot be released.
JOB.12.15	If he holds back the waters, there is drought;
JOB.12.15	if he lets them loose, they devastate the land.
JOB.12.16	To him belong strength and insight;
JOB.12.16	both deceived and deceiver are his.
JOB.12.17	He leads rulers away stripped
JOB.12.17	and makes fools of judges.
JOB.12.18	He takes off the shackles put on by kings
JOB.12.18	and ties a loincloth
JOB.12.19	He leads priests away stripped
JOB.12.19	and overthrows officials long established.
JOB.12.20	He silences the lips of trusted advisers
JOB.12.20	and takes away the discernment of elders.
JOB.12.21	He pours contempt on nobles
JOB.12.21	and disarms the mighty.
JOB.12.22	He reveals the deep things of darkness
JOB.12.22	and brings utter darkness into the light.
JOB.12.23	He makes nations great, and destroys them;
JOB.12.23	he enlarges nations, and disperses them.
JOB.12.24	He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason;
JOB.12.24	he makes them wander in a trackless waste.
JOB.12.25	They grope in darkness with no light;
JOB.12.25	he makes them stagger like drunkards.
JOB.13.1	“My eyes have seen all this,
JOB.13.1	my ears have heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	What you know, I also know;
JOB.13.2	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.13.3	But I desire to speak to the Almighty
JOB.13.3	and to argue my case with God.
JOB.13.4	You, however, smear me with lies;
JOB.13.4	you are worthless physicians, all of you!
JOB.13.5	If only you would be altogether silent!
JOB.13.5	For you, that would be wisdom.
JOB.13.6	Hear now my argument;
JOB.13.6	listen to the pleas of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf?
JOB.13.7	Will you speak deceitfully for him?
JOB.13.8	Will you show him partiality?
JOB.13.8	Will you argue the case for God?
JOB.13.9	Would it turn out well if he examined you?
JOB.13.9	Could you deceive him as you might deceive a mortal?
JOB.13.10	He would surely call you to account
JOB.13.10	if you secretly showed partiality.
JOB.13.11	Would not his splendor terrify you?
JOB.13.11	Would not the dread of him fall on you?
JOB.13.12	Your maxims are proverbs of ashes;
JOB.13.12	your defenses are defenses of clay.
JOB.13.13	“Keep silent and let me speak;
JOB.13.13	then let come to me what may.
JOB.13.14	Why do I put myself in jeopardy
JOB.13.14	and take my life in my hands?
JOB.13.15	Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him;
JOB.13.15	I will surely
JOB.13.16	Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance,
JOB.13.16	for no godless person would dare come before him!
JOB.13.17	Listen carefully to what I say;
JOB.13.17	let my words ring in your ears.
JOB.13.18	Now that I have prepared my case,
JOB.13.18	I know I will be vindicated.
JOB.13.19	Can anyone bring charges against me?
JOB.13.19	If so, I will be silent and die.
JOB.13.20	“Only grant me these two things, God,
JOB.13.20	and then I will not hide from you:
JOB.13.21	Withdraw your hand far from me,
JOB.13.21	and stop frightening me with your terrors.
JOB.13.22	Then summon me and I will answer,
JOB.13.22	or let me speak, and you reply to me.
JOB.13.23	How many wrongs and sins have I committed?
JOB.13.23	Show me my offense and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Why do you hide your face
JOB.13.24	and consider me your enemy?
JOB.13.25	Will you torment a windblown leaf?
JOB.13.25	Will you chase after dry chaff?
JOB.13.26	For you write down bitter things against me
JOB.13.26	and make me reap the sins of my youth.
JOB.13.27	You fasten my feet in shackles;
JOB.13.27	you keep close watch on all my paths
JOB.13.27	by putting marks on the soles of my feet.
JOB.13.28	“So man wastes away like something rotten,
JOB.13.28	like a garment eaten by moths.
JOB.14.1	“Mortals, born of woman,
JOB.14.1	are of few days and full of trouble.
JOB.14.2	They spring up like flowers and wither away;
JOB.14.2	like fleeting shadows, they do not endure.
JOB.14.3	Do you fix your eye on them?
JOB.14.3	Will you bring them
JOB.14.4	Who can bring what is pure from the impure?
JOB.14.4	No one!
JOB.14.5	A person’s days are determined;
JOB.14.5	you have decreed the number of his months
JOB.14.5	and have set limits he cannot exceed.
JOB.14.6	So look away from him and let him alone,
JOB.14.6	till he has put in his time like a hired laborer.
JOB.14.7	“At least there is hope for a tree:
JOB.14.7	If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
JOB.14.7	and its new shoots will not fail.
JOB.14.8	Its roots may grow old in the ground
JOB.14.8	and its stump die in the soil,
JOB.14.9	yet at the scent of water it will bud
JOB.14.9	and put forth shoots like a plant.
JOB.14.10	But a man dies and is laid low;
JOB.14.10	he breathes his last and is no more.
JOB.14.11	As the water of a lake dries up
JOB.14.11	or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,
JOB.14.12	so he lies down and does not rise;
JOB.14.12	till the heavens are no more, people will not awake
JOB.14.12	or be roused from their sleep.
JOB.14.13	“If only you would hide me in the grave
JOB.14.13	and conceal me till your anger has passed!
JOB.14.13	If only you would set me a time
JOB.14.13	and then remember me!
JOB.14.14	If someone dies, will they live again?
JOB.14.14	All the days of my hard service
JOB.14.14	I will wait for my renewal
JOB.14.15	You will call and I will answer you;
JOB.14.15	you will long for the creature your hands have made.
JOB.14.16	Surely then you will count my steps
JOB.14.16	but not keep track of my sin.
JOB.14.17	My offenses will be sealed up in a bag;
JOB.14.17	you will cover over my sin.
JOB.14.18	“But as a mountain erodes and crumbles
JOB.14.18	and as a rock is moved from its place,
JOB.14.19	as water wears away stones
JOB.14.19	and torrents wash away the soil,
JOB.14.19	so you destroy a person’s hope.
JOB.14.20	You overpower them once for all, and they are gone;
JOB.14.20	you change their countenance and send them away.
JOB.14.21	If their children are honored, they do not know it;
JOB.14.21	if their offspring are brought low, they do not see it.
JOB.14.22	They feel but the pain of their own bodies
JOB.14.22	and mourn only for themselves.”
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
JOB.15.2	“Would a wise person answer with empty notions
JOB.15.2	or fill their belly with the hot east wind?
JOB.15.3	Would they argue with useless words,
JOB.15.3	with speeches that have no value?
JOB.15.4	But you even undermine piety
JOB.15.4	and hinder devotion to God.
JOB.15.5	Your sin prompts your mouth;
JOB.15.5	you adopt the tongue of the crafty.
JOB.15.6	Your own mouth condemns you, not mine;
JOB.15.6	your own lips testify against you.
JOB.15.7	“Are you the first man ever born?
JOB.15.7	Were you brought forth before the hills?
JOB.15.8	Do you listen in on God’s council?
JOB.15.8	Do you have a monopoly on wisdom?
JOB.15.9	What do you know that we do not know?
JOB.15.9	What insights do you have that we do not have?
JOB.15.10	The gray-haired and the aged are on our side,
JOB.15.10	men even older than your father.
JOB.15.11	Are God’s consolations not enough for you,
JOB.15.11	words spoken gently to you?
JOB.15.12	Why has your heart carried you away,
JOB.15.12	and why do your eyes flash,
JOB.15.13	so that you vent your rage against God
JOB.15.13	and pour out such words from your mouth?
JOB.15.14	“What are mortals, that they could be pure,
JOB.15.14	or those born of woman, that they could be righteous?
JOB.15.15	If God places no trust in his holy ones,
JOB.15.15	if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,
JOB.15.16	how much less mortals, who are vile and corrupt,
JOB.15.16	who drink up evil like water!
JOB.15.17	“Listen to me and I will explain to you;
JOB.15.17	let me tell you what I have seen,
JOB.15.18	what the wise have declared,
JOB.15.18	hiding nothing received from their ancestors
JOB.15.19	(to whom alone the land was given
JOB.15.19	when no foreigners moved among them):
JOB.15.20	All his days the wicked man suffers torment,
JOB.15.20	the ruthless man through all the years stored up for him.
JOB.15.21	Terrifying sounds fill his ears;
JOB.15.21	when all seems well, marauders attack him.
JOB.15.22	He despairs of escaping the realm of darkness;
JOB.15.22	he is marked for the sword.
JOB.15.23	He wanders about for food like a vulture;
JOB.15.23	he knows the day of darkness is at hand.
JOB.15.24	Distress and anguish fill him with terror;
JOB.15.24	troubles overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,
JOB.15.25	because he shakes his fist at God
JOB.15.25	and vaunts himself against the Almighty,
JOB.15.26	defiantly charging against him
JOB.15.26	with a thick, strong shield.
JOB.15.27	“Though his face is covered with fat
JOB.15.27	and his waist bulges with flesh,
JOB.15.28	he will inhabit ruined towns
JOB.15.28	and houses where no one lives,
JOB.15.28	houses crumbling to rubble.
JOB.15.29	He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure,
JOB.15.29	nor will his possessions spread over the land.
JOB.15.30	He will not escape the darkness;
JOB.15.30	a flame will wither his shoots,
JOB.15.30	and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.
JOB.15.31	Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless,
JOB.15.31	for he will get nothing in return.
JOB.15.32	Before his time he will wither,
JOB.15.32	and his branches will not flourish.
JOB.15.33	He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes,
JOB.15.33	like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.
JOB.15.34	For the company of the godless will be barren,
JOB.15.34	and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.
JOB.15.35	They conceive trouble and give birth to evil;
JOB.15.35	their womb fashions deceit.”
JOB.16.1	Then Job replied:
JOB.16.2	“I have heard many things like these;
JOB.16.2	you are miserable comforters, all of you!
JOB.16.3	Will your long-winded speeches never end?
JOB.16.3	What ails you that you keep on arguing?
JOB.16.4	I also could speak like you,
JOB.16.4	if you were in my place;
JOB.16.4	I could make fine speeches against you
JOB.16.4	and shake my head at you.
JOB.16.5	But my mouth would encourage you;
JOB.16.5	comfort from my lips would bring you relief.
JOB.16.6	“Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved;
JOB.16.6	and if I refrain, it does not go away.
JOB.16.7	Surely, God, you have worn me out;
JOB.16.7	you have devastated my entire household.
JOB.16.8	You have shriveled me up—and it has become a witness;
JOB.16.8	my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.
JOB.16.9	God assails me and tears me in his anger
JOB.16.9	and gnashes his teeth at me;
JOB.16.9	my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.
JOB.16.10	People open their mouths to jeer at me;
JOB.16.10	they strike my cheek in scorn
JOB.16.10	and unite together against me.
JOB.16.11	God has turned me over to the ungodly
JOB.16.11	and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.
JOB.16.12	All was well with me, but he shattered me;
JOB.16.12	he seized me by the neck and crushed me.
JOB.16.12	He has made me his target;
JOB.16.13	his archers surround me.
JOB.16.13	Without pity, he pierces my kidneys
JOB.16.13	and spills my gall on the ground.
JOB.16.14	Again and again he bursts upon me;
JOB.16.14	he rushes at me like a warrior.
JOB.16.15	“I have sewed sackcloth over my skin
JOB.16.15	and buried my brow in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is red with weeping,
JOB.16.16	dark shadows ring my eyes;
JOB.16.17	yet my hands have been free of violence
JOB.16.17	and my prayer is pure.
JOB.16.18	“Earth, do not cover my blood;
JOB.16.18	may my cry never be laid to rest!
JOB.16.19	Even now my witness is in heaven;
JOB.16.19	my advocate is on high.
JOB.16.20	My intercessor is my friend
JOB.16.20	as my eyes pour out tears to God;
JOB.16.21	on behalf of a man he pleads with God
JOB.16.21	as one pleads for a friend.
JOB.16.22	“Only a few years will pass
JOB.16.22	before I take the path of no return.
JOB.17.1	My spirit is broken,
JOB.17.1	my days are cut short,
JOB.17.1	the grave awaits me.
JOB.17.2	Surely mockers surround me;
JOB.17.2	my eyes must dwell on their hostility.
JOB.17.3	“Give me, O God, the pledge you demand.
JOB.17.3	Who else will put up security for me?
JOB.17.4	You have closed their minds to understanding;
JOB.17.4	therefore you will not let them triumph.
JOB.17.5	If anyone denounces their friends for reward,
JOB.17.5	the eyes of their children will fail.
JOB.17.6	“God has made me a byword to everyone,
JOB.17.6	a man in whose face people spit.
JOB.17.7	My eyes have grown dim with grief;
JOB.17.7	my whole frame is but a shadow.
JOB.17.8	The upright are appalled at this;
JOB.17.8	the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.
JOB.17.9	Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways,
JOB.17.9	and those with clean hands will grow stronger.
JOB.17.10	“But come on, all of you, try again!
JOB.17.10	I will not find a wise man among you.
JOB.17.11	My days have passed, my plans are shattered.
JOB.17.11	Yet the desires of my heart
JOB.17.12	turn night into day;
JOB.17.12	in the face of the darkness light is near.
JOB.17.13	If the only home I hope for is the grave,
JOB.17.13	if I spread out my bed in the realm of darkness,
JOB.17.14	if I say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’
JOB.17.14	and to the worm, ‘My mother’ or ‘My sister,’
JOB.17.15	where then is my hope—
JOB.17.15	who can see any hope for me?
JOB.17.16	Will it go down to the gates of death?
JOB.17.16	Will we descend together into the dust?”
JOB.18.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
JOB.18.2	“When will you end these speeches?
JOB.18.2	Be sensible, and then we can talk.
JOB.18.3	Why are we regarded as cattle
JOB.18.3	and considered stupid in your sight?
JOB.18.4	You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger,
JOB.18.4	is the earth to be abandoned for your sake?
JOB.18.4	Or must the rocks be moved from their place?
JOB.18.5	“The lamp of a wicked man is snuffed out;
JOB.18.5	the flame of his fire stops burning.
JOB.18.6	The light in his tent becomes dark;
JOB.18.6	the lamp beside him goes out.
JOB.18.7	The vigor of his step is weakened;
JOB.18.7	his own schemes throw him down.
JOB.18.8	His feet thrust him into a net;
JOB.18.8	he wanders into its mesh.
JOB.18.9	A trap seizes him by the heel;
JOB.18.9	a snare holds him fast.
JOB.18.10	A noose is hidden for him on the ground;
JOB.18.10	a trap lies in his path.
JOB.18.11	Terrors startle him on every side
JOB.18.11	and dog his every step.
JOB.18.12	Calamity is hungry for him;
JOB.18.12	disaster is ready for him when he falls.
JOB.18.13	It eats away parts of his skin;
JOB.18.13	death’s firstborn devours his limbs.
JOB.18.14	He is torn from the security of his tent
JOB.18.14	and marched off to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	Fire resides
JOB.18.15	burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.
JOB.18.16	His roots dry up below
JOB.18.16	and his branches wither above.
JOB.18.17	The memory of him perishes from the earth;
JOB.18.17	he has no name in the land.
JOB.18.18	He is driven from light into the realm of darkness
JOB.18.18	and is banished from the world.
JOB.18.19	He has no offspring or descendants among his people,
JOB.18.19	no survivor where once he lived.
JOB.18.20	People of the west are appalled at his fate;
JOB.18.20	those of the east are seized with horror.
JOB.18.21	Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man;
JOB.18.21	such is the place of one who does not know God.”
JOB.19.1	Then Job replied:
JOB.19.2	“How long will you torment me
JOB.19.2	and crush me with words?
JOB.19.3	Ten times now you have reproached me;
JOB.19.3	shamelessly you attack me.
JOB.19.4	If it is true that I have gone astray,
JOB.19.4	my error remains my concern alone.
JOB.19.5	If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me
JOB.19.5	and use my humiliation against me,
JOB.19.6	then know that God has wronged me
JOB.19.6	and drawn his net around me.
JOB.19.7	“Though I cry, ‘Violence!’ I get no response;
JOB.19.7	though I call for help, there is no justice.
JOB.19.8	He has blocked my way so I cannot pass;
JOB.19.8	he has shrouded my paths in darkness.
JOB.19.9	He has stripped me of my honor
JOB.19.9	and removed the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He tears me down on every side till I am gone;
JOB.19.10	he uproots my hope like a tree.
JOB.19.11	His anger burns against me;
JOB.19.11	he counts me among his enemies.
JOB.19.12	His troops advance in force;
JOB.19.12	they build a siege ramp against me
JOB.19.12	and encamp around my tent.
JOB.19.13	“He has alienated my family from me;
JOB.19.13	my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My relatives have gone away;
JOB.19.14	my closest friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	My guests and my female servants count me a foreigner;
JOB.19.15	they look on me as on a stranger.
JOB.19.16	I summon my servant, but he does not answer,
JOB.19.16	though I beg him with my own mouth.
JOB.19.17	My breath is offensive to my wife;
JOB.19.17	I am loathsome to my own family.
JOB.19.18	Even the little boys scorn me;
JOB.19.18	when I appear, they ridicule me.
JOB.19.19	All my intimate friends detest me;
JOB.19.19	those I love have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	I am nothing but skin and bones;
JOB.19.20	I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	“Have pity on me, my friends, have pity,
JOB.19.21	for the hand of God has struck me.
JOB.19.22	Why do you pursue me as God does?
JOB.19.22	Will you never get enough of my flesh?
JOB.19.23	“Oh, that my words were recorded,
JOB.19.23	that they were written on a scroll,
JOB.19.24	that they were inscribed with an iron tool on
JOB.19.24	or engraved in rock forever!
JOB.19.25	I know that my redeemer
JOB.19.25	and that in the end he will stand on the earth.
JOB.19.26	And after my skin has been destroyed,
JOB.19.26	yet
JOB.19.27	I myself will see him
JOB.19.27	with my own eyes—I, and not another.
JOB.19.27	How my heart yearns within me!
JOB.19.28	“If you say, ‘How we will hound him,
JOB.19.28	since the root of the trouble lies in him,
JOB.19.29	you should fear the sword yourselves;
JOB.19.29	for wrath will bring punishment by the sword,
JOB.19.29	and then you will know that there is judgment.
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
JOB.20.2	“My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer
JOB.20.2	because I am greatly disturbed.
JOB.20.3	I hear a rebuke that dishonors me,
JOB.20.3	and my understanding inspires me to reply.
JOB.20.4	“Surely you know how it has been from of old,
JOB.20.4	ever since mankind
JOB.20.5	that the mirth of the wicked is brief,
JOB.20.5	the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.
JOB.20.6	Though the pride of the godless person reaches to the heavens
JOB.20.6	and his head touches the clouds,
JOB.20.7	he will perish forever, like his own dung;
JOB.20.7	those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
JOB.20.8	Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found,
JOB.20.8	banished like a vision of the night.
JOB.20.9	The eye that saw him will not see him again;
JOB.20.9	his place will look on him no more.
JOB.20.10	His children must make amends to the poor;
JOB.20.10	his own hands must give back his wealth.
JOB.20.11	The youthful vigor that fills his bones
JOB.20.11	will lie with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	“Though evil is sweet in his mouth
JOB.20.12	and he hides it under his tongue,
JOB.20.13	though he cannot bear to let it go
JOB.20.13	and lets it linger in his mouth,
JOB.20.14	yet his food will turn sour in his stomach;
JOB.20.14	it will become the venom of serpents within him.
JOB.20.15	He will spit out the riches he swallowed;
JOB.20.15	God will make his stomach vomit them up.
JOB.20.16	He will suck the poison of serpents;
JOB.20.16	the fangs of an adder will kill him.
JOB.20.17	He will not enjoy the streams,
JOB.20.17	the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
JOB.20.18	What he toiled for he must give back uneaten;
JOB.20.18	he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.
JOB.20.19	For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute;
JOB.20.19	he has seized houses he did not build.
JOB.20.20	“Surely he will have no respite from his craving;
JOB.20.20	he cannot save himself by his treasure.
JOB.20.21	Nothing is left for him to devour;
JOB.20.21	his prosperity will not endure.
JOB.20.22	In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him;
JOB.20.22	the full force of misery will come upon him.
JOB.20.23	When he has filled his belly,
JOB.20.23	God will vent his burning anger against him
JOB.20.23	and rain down his blows on him.
JOB.20.24	Though he flees from an iron weapon,
JOB.20.24	a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.
JOB.20.25	He pulls it out of his back,
JOB.20.25	the gleaming point out of his liver.
JOB.20.25	Terrors will come over him;
JOB.20.26	total darkness lies in wait for his treasures.
JOB.20.26	A fire unfanned will consume him
JOB.20.26	and devour what is left in his tent.
JOB.20.27	The heavens will expose his guilt;
JOB.20.27	the earth will rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	A flood will carry off his house,
JOB.20.28	rushing waters
JOB.20.29	Such is the fate God allots the wicked,
JOB.20.29	the heritage appointed for them by God.”
JOB.21.1	Then Job replied:
JOB.21.2	“Listen carefully to my words;
JOB.21.2	let this be the consolation you give me.
JOB.21.3	Bear with me while I speak,
JOB.21.3	and after I have spoken, mock on.
JOB.21.4	“Is my complaint directed to a human being?
JOB.21.4	Why should I not be impatient?
JOB.21.5	Look at me and be appalled;
JOB.21.5	clap your hand over your mouth.
JOB.21.6	When I think about this, I am terrified;
JOB.21.6	trembling seizes my body.
JOB.21.7	Why do the wicked live on,
JOB.21.7	growing old and increasing in power?
JOB.21.8	They see their children established around them,
JOB.21.8	their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their homes are safe and free from fear;
JOB.21.9	the rod of God is not on them.
JOB.21.10	Their bulls never fail to breed;
JOB.21.10	their cows calve and do not miscarry.
JOB.21.11	They send forth their children as a flock;
JOB.21.11	their little ones dance about.
JOB.21.12	They sing to the music of timbrel and lyre;
JOB.21.12	they make merry to the sound of the pipe.
JOB.21.13	They spend their years in prosperity
JOB.21.13	and go down to the grave in peace.
JOB.21.14	Yet they say to God, ‘Leave us alone!
JOB.21.14	We have no desire to know your ways.
JOB.21.15	Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
JOB.21.15	What would we gain by praying to him?’
JOB.21.16	But their prosperity is not in their own hands,
JOB.21.16	so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked.
JOB.21.17	“Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out?
JOB.21.17	How often does calamity come upon them,
JOB.21.17	the fate God allots in his anger?
JOB.21.18	How often are they like straw before the wind,
JOB.21.18	like chaff swept away by a gale?
JOB.21.19	It is said, ‘God stores up the punishment of the wicked for their children.’
JOB.21.19	Let him repay the wicked, so that they themselves will experience it!
JOB.21.20	Let their own eyes see their destruction;
JOB.21.20	let them drink the cup of the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For what do they care about the families they leave behind
JOB.21.21	when their allotted months come to an end?
JOB.21.22	“Can anyone teach knowledge to God,
JOB.21.22	since he judges even the highest?
JOB.21.23	One person dies in full vigor,
JOB.21.23	completely secure and at ease,
JOB.21.24	well nourished in body,
JOB.21.24	bones rich with marrow.
JOB.21.25	Another dies in bitterness of soul,
JOB.21.25	never having enjoyed anything good.
JOB.21.26	Side by side they lie in the dust,
JOB.21.26	and worms cover them both.
JOB.21.27	“I know full well what you are thinking,
JOB.21.27	the schemes by which you would wrong me.
JOB.21.28	You say, ‘Where now is the house of the great,
JOB.21.28	the tents where the wicked lived?’
JOB.21.29	Have you never questioned those who travel?
JOB.21.29	Have you paid no regard to their accounts—
JOB.21.30	that the wicked are spared from the day of calamity,
JOB.21.30	that they are delivered from
JOB.21.31	Who denounces their conduct to their face?
JOB.21.31	Who repays them for what they have done?
JOB.21.32	They are carried to the grave,
JOB.21.32	and watch is kept over their tombs.
JOB.21.33	The soil in the valley is sweet to them;
JOB.21.33	everyone follows after them,
JOB.21.33	and a countless throng goes
JOB.21.34	“So how can you console me with your nonsense?
JOB.21.34	Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!”
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
JOB.22.2	“Can a man be of benefit to God?
JOB.22.2	Can even a wise person benefit him?
JOB.22.3	What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous?
JOB.22.3	What would he gain if your ways were blameless?
JOB.22.4	“Is it for your piety that he rebukes you
JOB.22.4	and brings charges against you?
JOB.22.5	Is not your wickedness great?
JOB.22.5	Are not your sins endless?
JOB.22.6	You demanded security from your relatives for no reason;
JOB.22.6	you stripped people of their clothing, leaving them naked.
JOB.22.7	You gave no water to the weary
JOB.22.7	and you withheld food from the hungry,
JOB.22.8	though you were a powerful man, owning land—
JOB.22.8	an honored man, living on it.
JOB.22.9	And you sent widows away empty-handed
JOB.22.9	and broke the strength of the fatherless.
JOB.22.10	That is why snares are all around you,
JOB.22.10	why sudden peril terrifies you,
JOB.22.11	why it is so dark you cannot see,
JOB.22.11	and why a flood of water covers you.
JOB.22.12	“Is not God in the heights of heaven?
JOB.22.12	And see how lofty are the highest stars!
JOB.22.13	Yet you say, ‘What does God know?
JOB.22.13	Does he judge through such darkness?
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us
JOB.22.14	as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.’
JOB.22.15	Will you keep to the old path
JOB.22.15	that the wicked have trod?
JOB.22.16	They were carried off before their time,
JOB.22.16	their foundations washed away by a flood.
JOB.22.17	They said to God, ‘Leave us alone!
JOB.22.17	What can the Almighty do to us?’
JOB.22.18	Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things,
JOB.22.18	so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked.
JOB.22.19	The righteous see their ruin and rejoice;
JOB.22.19	the innocent mock them, saying,
JOB.22.20	‘Surely our foes are destroyed,
JOB.22.20	and fire devours their wealth.’
JOB.22.21	“Submit to God and be at peace with him;
JOB.22.21	in this way prosperity will come to you.
JOB.22.22	Accept instruction from his mouth
JOB.22.22	and lay up his words in your heart.
JOB.22.23	If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored:
JOB.22.23	If you remove wickedness far from your tent
JOB.22.24	and assign your nuggets to the dust,
JOB.22.24	your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,
JOB.22.25	then the Almighty will be your gold,
JOB.22.25	the choicest silver for you.
JOB.22.26	Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty
JOB.22.26	and will lift up your face to God.
JOB.22.27	You will pray to him, and he will hear you,
JOB.22.27	and you will fulfill your vows.
JOB.22.28	What you decide on will be done,
JOB.22.28	and light will shine on your ways.
JOB.22.29	When people are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’
JOB.22.29	then he will save the downcast.
JOB.22.30	He will deliver even one who is not innocent,
JOB.22.30	who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”
JOB.23.1	Then Job replied:
JOB.23.2	“Even today my complaint is bitter;
JOB.23.2	his hand
JOB.23.3	If only I knew where to find him;
JOB.23.3	if only I could go to his dwelling!
JOB.23.4	I would state my case before him
JOB.23.4	and fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would find out what he would answer me,
JOB.23.5	and consider what he would say to me.
JOB.23.6	Would he vigorously oppose me?
JOB.23.6	No, he would not press charges against me.
JOB.23.7	There the upright can establish their innocence before him,
JOB.23.7	and there I would be delivered forever from my judge.
JOB.23.8	“But if I go to the east, he is not there;
JOB.23.8	if I go to the west, I do not find him.
JOB.23.9	When he is at work in the north, I do not see him;
JOB.23.9	when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.
JOB.23.10	But he knows the way that I take;
JOB.23.10	when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
JOB.23.11	My feet have closely followed his steps;
JOB.23.11	I have kept to his way without turning aside.
JOB.23.12	I have not departed from the commands of his lips;
JOB.23.12	I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.
JOB.23.13	“But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?
JOB.23.13	He does whatever he pleases.
JOB.23.14	He carries out his decree against me,
JOB.23.14	and many such plans he still has in store.
JOB.23.15	That is why I am terrified before him;
JOB.23.15	when I think of all this, I fear him.
JOB.23.16	God has made my heart faint;
JOB.23.16	the Almighty has terrified me.
JOB.23.17	Yet I am not silenced by the darkness,
JOB.23.17	by the thick darkness that covers my face.
JOB.24.1	“Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment?
JOB.24.1	Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?
JOB.24.2	There are those who move boundary stones;
JOB.24.2	they pasture flocks they have stolen.
JOB.24.3	They drive away the orphan’s donkey
JOB.24.3	and take the widow’s ox in pledge.
JOB.24.4	They thrust the needy from the path
JOB.24.4	and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
JOB.24.5	Like wild donkeys in the desert,
JOB.24.5	the poor go about their labor of foraging food;
JOB.24.5	the wasteland provides food for their children.
JOB.24.6	They gather fodder in the fields
JOB.24.6	and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked;
JOB.24.7	they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are drenched by mountain rains
JOB.24.8	and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.
JOB.24.9	The fatherless child is snatched from the breast;
JOB.24.9	the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.
JOB.24.10	Lacking clothes, they go about naked;
JOB.24.10	they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
JOB.24.11	They crush olives among the terraces
JOB.24.11	they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.
JOB.24.12	The groans of the dying rise from the city,
JOB.24.12	and the souls of the wounded cry out for help.
JOB.24.12	But God charges no one with wrongdoing.
JOB.24.13	“There are those who rebel against the light,
JOB.24.13	who do not know its ways
JOB.24.13	or stay in its paths.
JOB.24.14	When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up,
JOB.24.14	kills the poor and needy,
JOB.24.14	and in the night steals forth like a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk;
JOB.24.15	he thinks, ‘No eye will see me,’
JOB.24.15	and he keeps his face concealed.
JOB.24.16	In the dark, thieves break into houses,
JOB.24.16	but by day they shut themselves in;
JOB.24.16	they want nothing to do with the light.
JOB.24.17	For all of them, midnight is their morning;
JOB.24.17	they make friends with the terrors of darkness.
JOB.24.18	“Yet they are foam on the surface of the water;
JOB.24.18	their portion of the land is cursed,
JOB.24.18	so that no one goes to the vineyards.
JOB.24.19	As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow,
JOB.24.19	so the grave snatches away those who have sinned.
JOB.24.20	The womb forgets them,
JOB.24.20	the worm feasts on them;
JOB.24.20	the wicked are no longer remembered
JOB.24.20	but are broken like a tree.
JOB.24.21	They prey on the barren and childless woman,
JOB.24.21	and to the widow they show no kindness.
JOB.24.22	But God drags away the mighty by his power;
JOB.24.22	though they become established, they have no assurance of life.
JOB.24.23	He may let them rest in a feeling of security,
JOB.24.23	but his eyes are on their ways.
JOB.24.24	For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone;
JOB.24.24	they are brought low and gathered up like all others;
JOB.24.24	they are cut off like heads of grain.
JOB.24.25	“If this is not so, who can prove me false
JOB.24.25	and reduce my words to nothing?”
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
JOB.25.2	“Dominion and awe belong to God;
JOB.25.2	he establishes order in the heights of heaven.
JOB.25.3	Can his forces be numbered?
JOB.25.3	On whom does his light not rise?
JOB.25.4	How then can a mortal be righteous before God?
JOB.25.4	How can one born of woman be pure?
JOB.25.5	If even the moon is not bright
JOB.25.5	and the stars are not pure in his eyes,
JOB.25.6	how much less a mortal, who is but a maggot—
JOB.25.6	a human being, who is only a worm!”
JOB.26.1	Then Job replied:
JOB.26.2	“How you have helped the powerless!
JOB.26.2	How you have saved the arm that is feeble!
JOB.26.3	What advice you have offered to one without wisdom!
JOB.26.3	And what great insight you have displayed!
JOB.26.4	Who has helped you utter these words?
JOB.26.4	And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?
JOB.26.5	“The dead are in deep anguish,
JOB.26.5	those beneath the waters and all that live in them.
JOB.26.6	The realm of the dead is naked before God;
JOB.26.6	Destruction
JOB.26.7	He spreads out the northern skies over empty space;
JOB.26.7	he suspends the earth over nothing.
JOB.26.8	He wraps up the waters in his clouds,
JOB.26.8	yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.
JOB.26.9	He covers the face of the full moon,
JOB.26.9	spreading his clouds over it.
JOB.26.10	He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters
JOB.26.10	for a boundary between light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of the heavens quake,
JOB.26.11	aghast at his rebuke.
JOB.26.12	By his power he churned up the sea;
JOB.26.12	by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.
JOB.26.13	By his breath the skies became fair;
JOB.26.13	his hand pierced the gliding serpent.
JOB.26.14	And these are but the outer fringe of his works;
JOB.26.14	how faint the whisper we hear of him!
JOB.26.14	Who then can understand the thunder of his power?”
JOB.27.1	And Job continued his discourse:
JOB.27.2	“As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice,
JOB.27.2	the Almighty, who has made my life bitter,
JOB.27.3	as long as I have life within me,
JOB.27.3	the breath of God in my nostrils,
JOB.27.4	my lips will not say anything wicked,
JOB.27.4	and my tongue will not utter lies.
JOB.27.5	I will never admit you are in the right;
JOB.27.5	till I die, I will not deny my integrity.
JOB.27.6	I will maintain my innocence and never let go of it;
JOB.27.6	my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.
JOB.27.7	“May my enemy be like the wicked,
JOB.27.7	my adversary like the unjust!
JOB.27.8	For what hope have the godless when they are cut off,
JOB.27.8	when God takes away their life?
JOB.27.9	Does God listen to their cry
JOB.27.9	when distress comes upon them?
JOB.27.10	Will they find delight in the Almighty?
JOB.27.10	Will they call on God at all times?
JOB.27.11	“I will teach you about the power of God;
JOB.27.11	the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.
JOB.27.12	You have all seen this yourselves.
JOB.27.12	Why then this meaningless talk?
JOB.27.13	“Here is the fate God allots to the wicked,
JOB.27.13	the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:
JOB.27.14	However many his children, their fate is the sword;
JOB.27.14	his offspring will never have enough to eat.
JOB.27.15	The plague will bury those who survive him,
JOB.27.15	and their widows will not weep for them.
JOB.27.16	Though he heaps up silver like dust
JOB.27.16	and clothes like piles of clay,
JOB.27.17	what he lays up the righteous will wear,
JOB.27.17	and the innocent will divide his silver.
JOB.27.18	The house he builds is like a moth’s cocoon,
JOB.27.18	like a hut made by a watchman.
JOB.27.19	He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more;
JOB.27.19	when he opens his eyes, all is gone.
JOB.27.20	Terrors overtake him like a flood;
JOB.27.20	a tempest snatches him away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind carries him off, and he is gone;
JOB.27.21	it sweeps him out of his place.
JOB.27.22	It hurls itself against him without mercy
JOB.27.22	as he flees headlong from its power.
JOB.27.23	It claps its hands in derision
JOB.27.23	and hisses him out of his place.”
JOB.28.1	There is a mine for silver
JOB.28.1	and a place where gold is refined.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken from the earth,
JOB.28.2	and copper is smelted from ore.
JOB.28.3	Mortals put an end to the darkness;
JOB.28.3	they search out the farthest recesses
JOB.28.3	for ore in the blackest darkness.
JOB.28.4	Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft,
JOB.28.4	in places untouched by human feet;
JOB.28.4	far from other people they dangle and sway.
JOB.28.5	The earth, from which food comes,
JOB.28.5	is transformed below as by fire;
JOB.28.6	lapis lazuli comes from its rocks,
JOB.28.6	and its dust contains nuggets of gold.
JOB.28.7	No bird of prey knows that hidden path,
JOB.28.7	no falcon’s eye has seen it.
JOB.28.8	Proud beasts do not set foot on it,
JOB.28.8	and no lion prowls there.
JOB.28.9	People assault the flinty rock with their hands
JOB.28.9	and lay bare the roots of the mountains.
JOB.28.10	They tunnel through the rock;
JOB.28.10	their eyes see all its treasures.
JOB.28.11	They search
JOB.28.11	and bring hidden things to light.
JOB.28.12	But where can wisdom be found?
JOB.28.12	Where does understanding dwell?
JOB.28.13	No mortal comprehends its worth;
JOB.28.13	it cannot be found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The deep says, “It is not in me”;
JOB.28.14	the sea says, “It is not with me.”
JOB.28.15	It cannot be bought with the finest gold,
JOB.28.15	nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
JOB.28.16	It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir,
JOB.28.16	with precious onyx or lapis lazuli.
JOB.28.17	Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it,
JOB.28.17	nor can it be had for jewels of gold.
JOB.28.18	Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention;
JOB.28.18	the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it;
JOB.28.19	it cannot be bought with pure gold.
JOB.28.20	Where then does wisdom come from?
JOB.28.20	Where does understanding dwell?
JOB.28.21	It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing,
JOB.28.21	concealed even from the birds in the sky.
JOB.28.22	Destruction
JOB.28.22	“Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.”
JOB.28.23	God understands the way to it
JOB.28.23	and he alone knows where it dwells,
JOB.28.24	for he views the ends of the earth
JOB.28.24	and sees everything under the heavens.
JOB.28.25	When he established the force of the wind
JOB.28.25	and measured out the waters,
JOB.28.26	when he made a decree for the rain
JOB.28.26	and a path for the thunderstorm,
JOB.28.27	then he looked at wisdom and appraised it;
JOB.28.27	he confirmed it and tested it.
JOB.28.28	And he said to the human race,
JOB.28.28	“The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom,
JOB.28.28	and to shun evil is understanding.”
JOB.29.1	Job continued his discourse:
JOB.29.2	“How I long for the months gone by,
JOB.29.2	for the days when God watched over me,
JOB.29.3	when his lamp shone on my head
JOB.29.3	and by his light I walked through darkness!
JOB.29.4	Oh, for the days when I was in my prime,
JOB.29.4	when God’s intimate friendship blessed my house,
JOB.29.5	when the Almighty was still with me
JOB.29.5	and my children were around me,
JOB.29.6	when my path was drenched with cream
JOB.29.6	and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.
JOB.29.7	“When I went to the gate of the city
JOB.29.7	and took my seat in the public square,
JOB.29.8	the young men saw me and stepped aside
JOB.29.8	and the old men rose to their feet;
JOB.29.9	the chief men refrained from speaking
JOB.29.9	and covered their mouths with their hands;
JOB.29.10	the voices of the nobles were hushed,
JOB.29.10	and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
JOB.29.11	Whoever heard me spoke well of me,
JOB.29.11	and those who saw me commended me,
JOB.29.12	because I rescued the poor who cried for help,
JOB.29.12	and the fatherless who had none to assist them.
JOB.29.13	The one who was dying blessed me;
JOB.29.13	I made the widow’s heart sing.
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness as my clothing;
JOB.29.14	justice was my robe and my turban.
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind
JOB.29.15	and feet to the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the needy;
JOB.29.16	I took up the case of the stranger.
JOB.29.17	I broke the fangs of the wicked
JOB.29.17	and snatched the victims from their teeth.
JOB.29.18	“I thought, ‘I will die in my own house,
JOB.29.18	my days as numerous as the grains of sand.
JOB.29.19	My roots will reach to the water,
JOB.29.19	and the dew will lie all night on my branches.
JOB.29.20	My glory will not fade;
JOB.29.20	the bow will be ever new in my hand.’
JOB.29.21	“People listened to me expectantly,
JOB.29.21	waiting in silence for my counsel.
JOB.29.22	After I had spoken, they spoke no more;
JOB.29.22	my words fell gently on their ears.
JOB.29.23	They waited for me as for showers
JOB.29.23	and drank in my words as the spring rain.
JOB.29.24	When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it;
JOB.29.24	the light of my face was precious to them.
JOB.29.25	I chose the way for them and sat as their chief;
JOB.29.25	I dwelt as a king among his troops;
JOB.29.25	I was like one who comforts mourners.
JOB.30.1	“But now they mock me,
JOB.30.1	men younger than I,
JOB.30.1	whose fathers I would have disdained
JOB.30.1	to put with my sheep dogs.
JOB.30.2	Of what use was the strength of their hands to me,
JOB.30.2	since their vigor had gone from them?
JOB.30.3	Haggard from want and hunger,
JOB.30.3	they roamed
JOB.30.3	in desolate wastelands at night.
JOB.30.4	In the brush they gathered salt herbs,
JOB.30.4	and their food
JOB.30.5	They were banished from human society,
JOB.30.5	shouted at as if they were thieves.
JOB.30.6	They were forced to live in the dry stream beds,
JOB.30.6	among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
JOB.30.7	They brayed among the bushes
JOB.30.7	and huddled in the undergrowth.
JOB.30.8	A base and nameless brood,
JOB.30.8	they were driven out of the land.
JOB.30.9	“And now those young men mock me in song;
JOB.30.9	I have become a byword among them.
JOB.30.10	They detest me and keep their distance;
JOB.30.10	they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me,
JOB.30.11	they throw off restraint in my presence.
JOB.30.12	On my right the tribe
JOB.30.12	they lay snares for my feet,
JOB.30.12	they build their siege ramps against me.
JOB.30.13	They break up my road;
JOB.30.13	they succeed in destroying me.
JOB.30.13	‘No one can help him,’ they say.
JOB.30.14	They advance as through a gaping breach;
JOB.30.14	amid the ruins they come rolling in.
JOB.30.15	Terrors overwhelm me;
JOB.30.15	my dignity is driven away as by the wind,
JOB.30.15	my safety vanishes like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	“And now my life ebbs away;
JOB.30.16	days of suffering grip me.
JOB.30.17	Night pierces my bones;
JOB.30.17	my gnawing pains never rest.
JOB.30.18	In his great power God becomes like clothing to me
JOB.30.18	he binds me like the neck of my garment.
JOB.30.19	He throws me into the mud,
JOB.30.19	and I am reduced to dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	“I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer;
JOB.30.20	I stand up, but you merely look at me.
JOB.30.21	You turn on me ruthlessly;
JOB.30.21	with the might of your hand you attack me.
JOB.30.22	You snatch me up and drive me before the wind;
JOB.30.22	you toss me about in the storm.
JOB.30.23	I know you will bring me down to death,
JOB.30.23	to the place appointed for all the living.
JOB.30.24	“Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man
JOB.30.24	when he cries for help in his distress.
JOB.30.25	Have I not wept for those in trouble?
JOB.30.25	Has not my soul grieved for the poor?
JOB.30.26	Yet when I hoped for good, evil came;
JOB.30.26	when I looked for light, then came darkness.
JOB.30.27	The churning inside me never stops;
JOB.30.27	days of suffering confront me.
JOB.30.28	I go about blackened, but not by the sun;
JOB.30.28	I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
JOB.30.29	I have become a brother of jackals,
JOB.30.29	a companion of owls.
JOB.30.30	My skin grows black and peels;
JOB.30.30	my body burns with fever.
JOB.30.31	My lyre is tuned to mourning,
JOB.30.31	and my pipe to the sound of wailing.
JOB.31.1	“I made a covenant with my eyes
JOB.31.1	not to look lustfully at a young woman.
JOB.31.2	For what is our lot from God above,
JOB.31.2	our heritage from the Almighty on high?
JOB.31.3	Is it not ruin for the wicked,
JOB.31.3	disaster for those who do wrong?
JOB.31.4	Does he not see my ways
JOB.31.4	and count my every step?
JOB.31.5	“If I have walked with falsehood
JOB.31.5	or my foot has hurried after deceit—
JOB.31.6	let God weigh me in honest scales
JOB.31.6	and he will know that I am blameless—
JOB.31.7	if my steps have turned from the path,
JOB.31.7	if my heart has been led by my eyes,
JOB.31.7	or if my hands have been defiled,
JOB.31.8	then may others eat what I have sown,
JOB.31.8	and may my crops be uprooted.
JOB.31.9	“If my heart has been enticed by a woman,
JOB.31.9	or if I have lurked at my neighbor’s door,
JOB.31.10	then may my wife grind another man’s grain,
JOB.31.10	and may other men sleep with her.
JOB.31.11	For that would have been wicked,
JOB.31.11	a sin to be judged.
JOB.31.12	It is a fire that burns to Destruction
JOB.31.12	it would have uprooted my harvest.
JOB.31.13	“If I have denied justice to any of my servants,
JOB.31.13	whether male or female,
JOB.31.13	when they had a grievance against me,
JOB.31.14	what will I do when God confronts me?
JOB.31.14	What will I answer when called to account?
JOB.31.15	Did not he who made me in the womb make them?
JOB.31.15	Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?
JOB.31.16	“If I have denied the desires of the poor
JOB.31.16	or let the eyes of the widow grow weary,
JOB.31.17	if I have kept my bread to myself,
JOB.31.17	not sharing it with the fatherless—
JOB.31.18	but from my youth I reared them as a father would,
JOB.31.18	and from my birth I guided the widow—
JOB.31.19	if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing,
JOB.31.19	or the needy without garments,
JOB.31.20	and their hearts did not bless me
JOB.31.20	for warming them with the fleece from my sheep,
JOB.31.21	if I have raised my hand against the fatherless,
JOB.31.21	knowing that I had influence in court,
JOB.31.22	then let my arm fall from the shoulder,
JOB.31.22	let it be broken off at the joint.
JOB.31.23	For I dreaded destruction from God,
JOB.31.23	and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.
JOB.31.24	“If I have put my trust in gold
JOB.31.24	or said to pure gold, ‘You are my security,’
JOB.31.25	if I have rejoiced over my great wealth,
JOB.31.25	the fortune my hands had gained,
JOB.31.26	if I have regarded the sun in its radiance
JOB.31.26	or the moon moving in splendor,
JOB.31.27	so that my heart was secretly enticed
JOB.31.27	and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,
JOB.31.28	then these also would be sins to be judged,
JOB.31.28	for I would have been unfaithful to God on high.
JOB.31.29	“If I have rejoiced at my enemy’s misfortune
JOB.31.29	or gloated over the trouble that came to him—
JOB.31.30	I have not allowed my mouth to sin
JOB.31.30	by invoking a curse against their life—
JOB.31.31	if those of my household have never said,
JOB.31.31	‘Who has not been filled with Job’s meat?’—
JOB.31.32	but no stranger had to spend the night in the street,
JOB.31.32	for my door was always open to the traveler—
JOB.31.33	if I have concealed my sin as people do,
JOB.31.33	by hiding my guilt in my heart
JOB.31.34	because I so feared the crowd
JOB.31.34	and so dreaded the contempt of the clans
JOB.31.34	that I kept silent and would not go outside—
JOB.31.35	(“Oh, that I had someone to hear me!
JOB.31.35	I sign now my defense—let the Almighty answer me;
JOB.31.35	let my accuser put his indictment in writing.
JOB.31.36	Surely I would wear it on my shoulder,
JOB.31.36	I would put it on like a crown.
JOB.31.37	I would give him an account of my every step;
JOB.31.37	I would present it to him as to a ruler.)—
JOB.31.38	“if my land cries out against me
JOB.31.38	and all its furrows are wet with tears,
JOB.31.39	if I have devoured its yield without payment
JOB.31.39	or broken the spirit of its tenants,
JOB.31.40	then let briers come up instead of wheat
JOB.31.40	and stinkweed instead of barley.”
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
JOB.32.2	But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God. 
JOB.32.3	He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he. 
JOB.32.5	But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.
JOB.32.6	So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said:
JOB.32.6	“I am young in years,
JOB.32.6	and you are old;
JOB.32.6	that is why I was fearful,
JOB.32.6	not daring to tell you what I know.
JOB.32.7	I thought, ‘Age should speak;
JOB.32.7	advanced years should teach wisdom.’
JOB.32.8	But it is the spirit
JOB.32.8	the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.
JOB.32.9	It is not only the old
JOB.32.9	not only the aged who understand what is right.
JOB.32.10	“Therefore I say: Listen to me;
JOB.32.10	I too will tell you what I know.
JOB.32.11	I waited while you spoke,
JOB.32.11	I listened to your reasoning;
JOB.32.11	while you were searching for words,
JOB.32.12	I gave you my full attention.
JOB.32.12	But not one of you has proved Job wrong;
JOB.32.12	none of you has answered his arguments.
JOB.32.13	Do not say, ‘We have found wisdom;
JOB.32.13	let God, not a man, refute him.’
JOB.32.14	But Job has not marshaled his words against me,
JOB.32.14	and I will not answer him with your arguments.
JOB.32.15	“They are dismayed and have no more to say;
JOB.32.15	words have failed them.
JOB.32.16	Must I wait, now that they are silent,
JOB.32.16	now that they stand there with no reply?
JOB.32.17	I too will have my say;
JOB.32.17	I too will tell what I know.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of words,
JOB.32.18	and the spirit within me compels me;
JOB.32.19	inside I am like bottled-up wine,
JOB.32.19	like new wineskins ready to burst.
JOB.32.20	I must speak and find relief;
JOB.32.20	I must open my lips and reply.
JOB.32.21	I will show no partiality,
JOB.32.21	nor will I flatter anyone;
JOB.32.22	for if I were skilled in flattery,
JOB.32.22	my Maker would soon take me away.
JOB.33.1	“But now, Job, listen to my words;
JOB.33.1	pay attention to everything I say.
JOB.33.2	I am about to open my mouth;
JOB.33.2	my words are on the tip of my tongue.
JOB.33.3	My words come from an upright heart;
JOB.33.3	my lips sincerely speak what I know.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God has made me;
JOB.33.4	the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
JOB.33.5	Answer me then, if you can;
JOB.33.5	stand up and argue your case before me.
JOB.33.6	I am the same as you in God’s sight;
JOB.33.6	I too am a piece of clay.
JOB.33.7	No fear of me should alarm you,
JOB.33.7	nor should my hand be heavy on you.
JOB.33.8	“But you have said in my hearing—
JOB.33.8	I heard the very words—
JOB.33.9	‘I am pure, I have done no wrong;
JOB.33.9	I am clean and free from sin.
JOB.33.10	Yet God has found fault with me;
JOB.33.10	he considers me his enemy.
JOB.33.11	He fastens my feet in shackles;
JOB.33.11	he keeps close watch on all my paths.’
JOB.33.12	“But I tell you, in this you are not right,
JOB.33.12	for God is greater than any mortal.
JOB.33.13	Why do you complain to him
JOB.33.13	that he responds to no one’s words
JOB.33.14	For God does speak—now one way, now another—
JOB.33.14	though no one perceives it.
JOB.33.15	In a dream, in a vision of the night,
JOB.33.15	when deep sleep falls on people
JOB.33.15	as they slumber in their beds,
JOB.33.16	he may speak in their ears
JOB.33.16	and terrify them with warnings,
JOB.33.17	to turn them from wrongdoing
JOB.33.17	and keep them from pride,
JOB.33.18	to preserve them from the pit,
JOB.33.18	their lives from perishing by the sword.
JOB.33.19	“Or someone may be chastened on a bed of pain
JOB.33.19	with constant distress in their bones,
JOB.33.20	so that their body finds food repulsive
JOB.33.20	and their soul loathes the choicest meal.
JOB.33.21	Their flesh wastes away to nothing,
JOB.33.21	and their bones, once hidden, now stick out.
JOB.33.22	They draw near to the pit,
JOB.33.22	and their life to the messengers of death.
JOB.33.23	Yet if there is an angel at their side,
JOB.33.23	a messenger, one out of a thousand,
JOB.33.23	sent to tell them how to be upright,
JOB.33.24	and he is gracious to that person and says to God,
JOB.33.24	‘Spare them from going down to the pit;
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom for them—
JOB.33.25	let their flesh be renewed like a child’s;
JOB.33.25	let them be restored as in the days of their youth’—
JOB.33.26	then that person can pray to God and find favor with him,
JOB.33.26	they will see God’s face and shout for joy;
JOB.33.26	he will restore them to full well-being.
JOB.33.27	And they will go to others and say,
JOB.33.27	‘I have sinned, I have perverted what is right,
JOB.33.27	but I did not get what I deserved.
JOB.33.28	God has delivered me from going down to the pit,
JOB.33.28	and I shall live to enjoy the light of life.’
JOB.33.29	“God does all these things to a person—
JOB.33.29	twice, even three times—
JOB.33.30	to turn them back from the pit,
JOB.33.30	that the light of life may shine on them.
JOB.33.31	“Pay attention, Job, and listen to me;
JOB.33.31	be silent, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	If you have anything to say, answer me;
JOB.33.32	speak up, for I want to vindicate you.
JOB.33.33	But if not, then listen to me;
JOB.33.33	be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
JOB.34.1	Then Elihu said:
JOB.34.2	“Hear my words, you wise men;
JOB.34.2	listen to me, you men of learning.
JOB.34.3	For the ear tests words
JOB.34.3	as the tongue tastes food.
JOB.34.4	Let us discern for ourselves what is right;
JOB.34.4	let us learn together what is good.
JOB.34.5	“Job says, ‘I am innocent,
JOB.34.5	but God denies me justice.
JOB.34.6	Although I am right,
JOB.34.6	I am considered a liar;
JOB.34.6	although I am guiltless,
JOB.34.6	his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.’
JOB.34.7	Is there anyone like Job,
JOB.34.7	who drinks scorn like water?
JOB.34.8	He keeps company with evildoers;
JOB.34.8	he associates with the wicked.
JOB.34.9	For he says, ‘There is no profit
JOB.34.9	in trying to please God.’
JOB.34.10	“So listen to me, you men of understanding.
JOB.34.10	Far be it from God to do evil,
JOB.34.10	from the Almighty to do wrong.
JOB.34.11	He repays everyone for what they have done;
JOB.34.11	he brings on them what their conduct deserves.
JOB.34.12	It is unthinkable that God would do wrong,
JOB.34.12	that the Almighty would pervert justice.
JOB.34.13	Who appointed him over the earth?
JOB.34.13	Who put him in charge of the whole world?
JOB.34.14	If it were his intention
JOB.34.14	and he withdrew his spirit
JOB.34.15	all humanity would perish together
JOB.34.15	and mankind would return to the dust.
JOB.34.16	“If you have understanding, hear this;
JOB.34.16	listen to what I say.
JOB.34.17	Can someone who hates justice govern?
JOB.34.17	Will you condemn the just and mighty One?
JOB.34.18	Is he not the One who says to kings, ‘You are worthless,’
JOB.34.18	and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’
JOB.34.19	who shows no partiality to princes
JOB.34.19	and does not favor the rich over the poor,
JOB.34.19	for they are all the work of his hands?
JOB.34.20	They die in an instant, in the middle of the night;
JOB.34.20	the people are shaken and they pass away;
JOB.34.20	the mighty are removed without human hand.
JOB.34.21	“His eyes are on the ways of mortals;
JOB.34.21	he sees their every step.
JOB.34.22	There is no deep shadow, no utter darkness,
JOB.34.22	where evildoers can hide.
JOB.34.23	God has no need to examine people further,
JOB.34.23	that they should come before him for judgment.
JOB.34.24	Without inquiry he shatters the mighty
JOB.34.24	and sets up others in their place.
JOB.34.25	Because he takes note of their deeds,
JOB.34.25	he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
JOB.34.26	He punishes them for their wickedness
JOB.34.26	where everyone can see them,
JOB.34.27	because they turned from following him
JOB.34.27	and had no regard for any of his ways.
JOB.34.28	They caused the cry of the poor to come before him,
JOB.34.28	so that he heard the cry of the needy.
JOB.34.29	But if he remains silent, who can condemn him?
JOB.34.29	If he hides his face, who can see him?
JOB.34.29	Yet he is over individual and nation alike,
JOB.34.30	to keep the godless from ruling,
JOB.34.30	from laying snares for the people.
JOB.34.31	“Suppose someone says to God,
JOB.34.31	‘I am guilty but will offend no more.
JOB.34.32	Teach me what I cannot see;
JOB.34.32	if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.’
JOB.34.33	Should God then reward you on your terms,
JOB.34.33	when you refuse to repent?
JOB.34.33	You must decide, not I;
JOB.34.33	so tell me what you know.
JOB.34.34	“Men of understanding declare,
JOB.34.34	wise men who hear me say to me,
JOB.34.35	‘Job speaks without knowledge;
JOB.34.35	his words lack insight.’
JOB.34.36	Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost
JOB.34.36	for answering like a wicked man!
JOB.34.37	To his sin he adds rebellion;
JOB.34.37	scornfully he claps his hands among us
JOB.34.37	and multiplies his words against God.”
JOB.35.1	Then Elihu said:
JOB.35.2	“Do you think this is just?
JOB.35.2	You say, ‘I am in the right, not God.’
JOB.35.3	Yet you ask him, ‘What profit is it to me,
JOB.35.3	and what do I gain by not sinning?’
JOB.35.4	“I would like to reply to you
JOB.35.4	and to your friends with you.
JOB.35.5	Look up at the heavens and see;
JOB.35.5	gaze at the clouds so high above you.
JOB.35.6	If you sin, how does that affect him?
JOB.35.6	If your sins are many, what does that do to him?
JOB.35.7	If you are righteous, what do you give to him,
JOB.35.7	or what does he receive from your hand?
JOB.35.8	Your wickedness only affects humans like yourself,
JOB.35.8	and your righteousness only other people.
JOB.35.9	“People cry out under a load of oppression;
JOB.35.9	they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.
JOB.35.10	But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,
JOB.35.10	who gives songs in the night,
JOB.35.11	who teaches us more than he teaches
JOB.35.11	and makes us wiser than
JOB.35.12	He does not answer when people cry out
JOB.35.12	because of the arrogance of the wicked.
JOB.35.13	Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea;
JOB.35.13	the Almighty pays no attention to it.
JOB.35.14	How much less, then, will he listen
JOB.35.14	when you say that you do not see him,
JOB.35.14	that your case is before him
JOB.35.14	and you must wait for him,
JOB.35.15	and further, that his anger never punishes
JOB.35.15	and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.
JOB.35.16	So Job opens his mouth with empty talk;
JOB.35.16	without knowledge he multiplies words.”
JOB.36.1	Elihu continued:
JOB.36.2	“Bear with me a little longer and I will show you
JOB.36.2	that there is more to be said in God’s behalf.
JOB.36.3	I get my knowledge from afar;
JOB.36.3	I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	Be assured that my words are not false;
JOB.36.4	one who has perfect knowledge is with you.
JOB.36.5	“God is mighty, but despises no one;
JOB.36.5	he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.
JOB.36.6	He does not keep the wicked alive
JOB.36.6	but gives the afflicted their rights.
JOB.36.7	He does not take his eyes off the righteous;
JOB.36.7	he enthrones them with kings
JOB.36.7	and exalts them forever.
JOB.36.8	But if people are bound in chains,
JOB.36.8	held fast by cords of affliction,
JOB.36.9	he tells them what they have done—
JOB.36.9	that they have sinned arrogantly.
JOB.36.10	He makes them listen to correction
JOB.36.10	and commands them to repent of their evil.
JOB.36.11	If they obey and serve him,
JOB.36.11	they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity
JOB.36.11	and their years in contentment.
JOB.36.12	But if they do not listen,
JOB.36.12	they will perish by the sword
JOB.36.12	and die without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	“The godless in heart harbor resentment;
JOB.36.13	even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.
JOB.36.14	They die in their youth,
JOB.36.14	among male prostitutes of the shrines.
JOB.36.15	But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering;
JOB.36.15	he speaks to them in their affliction.
JOB.36.16	“He is wooing you from the jaws of distress
JOB.36.16	to a spacious place free from restriction,
JOB.36.16	to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.
JOB.36.17	But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked;
JOB.36.17	judgment and justice have taken hold of you.
JOB.36.18	Be careful that no one entices you by riches;
JOB.36.18	do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
JOB.36.19	Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts
JOB.36.19	sustain you so you would not be in distress?
JOB.36.20	Do not long for the night,
JOB.36.20	to drag people away from their homes.
JOB.36.21	Beware of turning to evil,
JOB.36.21	which you seem to prefer to affliction.
JOB.36.22	“God is exalted in his power.
JOB.36.22	Who is a teacher like him?
JOB.36.23	Who has prescribed his ways for him,
JOB.36.23	or said to him, ‘You have done wrong’?
JOB.36.24	Remember to extol his work,
JOB.36.24	which people have praised in song.
JOB.36.25	All humanity has seen it;
JOB.36.25	mortals gaze on it from afar.
JOB.36.26	How great is God—beyond our understanding!
JOB.36.26	The number of his years is past finding out.
JOB.36.27	“He draws up the drops of water,
JOB.36.27	which distill as rain to the streams
JOB.36.28	the clouds pour down their moisture
JOB.36.28	and abundant showers fall on mankind.
JOB.36.29	Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds,
JOB.36.29	how he thunders from his pavilion?
JOB.36.30	See how he scatters his lightning about him,
JOB.36.30	bathing the depths of the sea.
JOB.36.31	This is the way he governs
JOB.36.31	and provides food in abundance.
JOB.36.32	He fills his hands with lightning
JOB.36.32	and commands it to strike its mark.
JOB.36.33	His thunder announces the coming storm;
JOB.36.33	even the cattle make known its approach.
JOB.37.1	“At this my heart pounds
JOB.37.1	and leaps from its place.
JOB.37.2	Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice,
JOB.37.2	to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
JOB.37.3	He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven
JOB.37.3	and sends it to the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After that comes the sound of his roar;
JOB.37.4	he thunders with his majestic voice.
JOB.37.4	When his voice resounds,
JOB.37.4	he holds nothing back.
JOB.37.5	God’s voice thunders in marvelous ways;
JOB.37.5	he does great things beyond our understanding.
JOB.37.6	He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’
JOB.37.6	and to the rain shower, ‘Be a mighty downpour.’
JOB.37.7	So that everyone he has made may know his work,
JOB.37.7	he stops all people from their labor.
JOB.37.8	The animals take cover;
JOB.37.8	they remain in their dens.
JOB.37.9	The tempest comes out from its chamber,
JOB.37.9	the cold from the driving winds.
JOB.37.10	The breath of God produces ice,
JOB.37.10	and the broad waters become frozen.
JOB.37.11	He loads the clouds with moisture;
JOB.37.11	he scatters his lightning through them.
JOB.37.12	At his direction they swirl around
JOB.37.12	over the face of the whole earth
JOB.37.12	to do whatever he commands them.
JOB.37.13	He brings the clouds to punish people,
JOB.37.13	or to water his earth and show his love.
JOB.37.14	“Listen to this, Job;
JOB.37.14	stop and consider God’s wonders.
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God controls the clouds
JOB.37.15	and makes his lightning flash?
JOB.37.16	Do you know how the clouds hang poised,
JOB.37.16	those wonders of him who has perfect knowledge?
JOB.37.17	You who swelter in your clothes
JOB.37.17	when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
JOB.37.18	can you join him in spreading out the skies,
JOB.37.18	hard as a mirror of cast bronze?
JOB.37.19	“Tell us what we should say to him;
JOB.37.19	we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.
JOB.37.20	Should he be told that I want to speak?
JOB.37.20	Would anyone ask to be swallowed up?
JOB.37.21	Now no one can look at the sun,
JOB.37.21	bright as it is in the skies
JOB.37.21	after the wind has swept them clean.
JOB.37.22	Out of the north he comes in golden splendor;
JOB.37.22	God comes in awesome majesty.
JOB.37.23	The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power;
JOB.37.23	in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.
JOB.37.24	Therefore, people revere him,
JOB.37.24	for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?
JOB.38.1	Then the 
JOB.38.2	“Who is this that obscures my plans
JOB.38.2	with words without knowledge?
JOB.38.3	Brace yourself like a man;
JOB.38.3	I will question you,
JOB.38.3	and you shall answer me.
JOB.38.4	“Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?
JOB.38.4	Tell me, if you understand.
JOB.38.5	Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!
JOB.38.5	Who stretched a measuring line across it?
JOB.38.6	On what were its footings set,
JOB.38.6	or who laid its cornerstone—
JOB.38.7	while the morning stars sang together
JOB.38.7	and all the angels
JOB.38.8	“Who shut up the sea behind doors
JOB.38.8	when it burst forth from the womb,
JOB.38.9	when I made the clouds its garment
JOB.38.9	and wrapped it in thick darkness,
JOB.38.10	when I fixed limits for it
JOB.38.10	and set its doors and bars in place,
JOB.38.11	when I said, ‘This far you may come and no farther;
JOB.38.11	here is where your proud waves halt’?
JOB.38.12	“Have you ever given orders to the morning,
JOB.38.12	or shown the dawn its place,
JOB.38.13	that it might take the earth by the edges
JOB.38.13	and shake the wicked out of it?
JOB.38.14	The earth takes shape like clay under a seal;
JOB.38.14	its features stand out like those of a garment.
JOB.38.15	The wicked are denied their light,
JOB.38.15	and their upraised arm is broken.
JOB.38.16	“Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea
JOB.38.16	or walked in the recesses of the deep?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been shown to you?
JOB.38.17	Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness?
JOB.38.18	Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth?
JOB.38.18	Tell me, if you know all this.
JOB.38.19	“What is the way to the abode of light?
JOB.38.19	And where does darkness reside?
JOB.38.20	Can you take them to their places?
JOB.38.20	Do you know the paths to their dwellings?
JOB.38.21	Surely you know, for you were already born!
JOB.38.21	You have lived so many years!
JOB.38.22	“Have you entered the storehouses of the snow
JOB.38.22	or seen the storehouses of the hail,
JOB.38.23	which I reserve for times of trouble,
JOB.38.23	for days of war and battle?
JOB.38.24	What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed,
JOB.38.24	or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?
JOB.38.25	Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain,
JOB.38.25	and a path for the thunderstorm,
JOB.38.26	to water a land where no one lives,
JOB.38.26	an uninhabited desert,
JOB.38.27	to satisfy a desolate wasteland
JOB.38.27	and make it sprout with grass?
JOB.38.28	Does the rain have a father?
JOB.38.28	Who fathers the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	From whose womb comes the ice?
JOB.38.29	Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens
JOB.38.30	when the waters become hard as stone,
JOB.38.30	when the surface of the deep is frozen?
JOB.38.31	“Can you bind the chains
JOB.38.31	Can you loosen Orion’s belt?
JOB.38.32	Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons
JOB.38.32	or lead out the Bear
JOB.38.33	Do you know the laws of the heavens?
JOB.38.33	Can you set up God’s
JOB.38.34	“Can you raise your voice to the clouds
JOB.38.34	and cover yourself with a flood of water?
JOB.38.35	Do you send the lightning bolts on their way?
JOB.38.35	Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?
JOB.38.36	Who gives the ibis wisdom
JOB.38.36	or gives the rooster understanding?
JOB.38.37	Who has the wisdom to count the clouds?
JOB.38.37	Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens
JOB.38.38	when the dust becomes hard
JOB.38.38	and the clods of earth stick together?
JOB.38.39	“Do you hunt the prey for the lioness
JOB.38.39	and satisfy the hunger of the lions
JOB.38.40	when they crouch in their dens
JOB.38.40	or lie in wait in a thicket?
JOB.38.41	Who provides food for the raven
JOB.38.41	when its young cry out to God
JOB.38.41	and wander about for lack of food?
JOB.39.1	“Do you know when the mountain goats give birth?
JOB.39.1	Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn?
JOB.39.2	Do you count the months till they bear?
JOB.39.2	Do you know the time they give birth?
JOB.39.3	They crouch down and bring forth their young;
JOB.39.3	their labor pains are ended.
JOB.39.4	Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds;
JOB.39.4	they leave and do not return.
JOB.39.5	“Who let the wild donkey go free?
JOB.39.5	Who untied its ropes?
JOB.39.6	I gave it the wasteland as its home,
JOB.39.6	the salt flats as its habitat.
JOB.39.7	It laughs at the commotion in the town;
JOB.39.7	it does not hear a driver’s shout.
JOB.39.8	It ranges the hills for its pasture
JOB.39.8	and searches for any green thing.
JOB.39.9	“Will the wild ox consent to serve you?
JOB.39.9	Will it stay by your manger at night?
JOB.39.10	Can you hold it to the furrow with a harness?
JOB.39.10	Will it till the valleys behind you?
JOB.39.11	Will you rely on it for its great strength?
JOB.39.11	Will you leave your heavy work to it?
JOB.39.12	Can you trust it to haul in your grain
JOB.39.12	and bring it to your threshing floor?
JOB.39.13	“The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully,
JOB.39.13	though they cannot compare
JOB.39.13	with the wings and feathers of the stork.
JOB.39.14	She lays her eggs on the ground
JOB.39.14	and lets them warm in the sand,
JOB.39.15	unmindful that a foot may crush them,
JOB.39.15	that some wild animal may trample them.
JOB.39.16	She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers;
JOB.39.16	she cares not that her labor was in vain,
JOB.39.17	for God did not endow her with wisdom
JOB.39.17	or give her a share of good sense.
JOB.39.18	Yet when she spreads her feathers to run,
JOB.39.18	she laughs at horse and rider.
JOB.39.19	“Do you give the horse its strength
JOB.39.19	or clothe its neck with a flowing mane?
JOB.39.20	Do you make it leap like a locust,
JOB.39.20	striking terror with its proud snorting?
JOB.39.21	It paws fiercely, rejoicing in its strength,
JOB.39.21	and charges into the fray.
JOB.39.22	It laughs at fear, afraid of nothing;
JOB.39.22	it does not shy away from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The quiver rattles against its side,
JOB.39.23	along with the flashing spear and lance.
JOB.39.24	In frenzied excitement it eats up the ground;
JOB.39.24	it cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.
JOB.39.25	At the blast of the trumpet it snorts, ‘Aha!’
JOB.39.25	It catches the scent of battle from afar,
JOB.39.25	the shout of commanders and the battle cry.
JOB.39.26	“Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom
JOB.39.26	and spread its wings toward the south?
JOB.39.27	Does the eagle soar at your command
JOB.39.27	and build its nest on high?
JOB.39.28	It dwells on a cliff and stays there at night;
JOB.39.28	a rocky crag is its stronghold.
JOB.39.29	From there it looks for food;
JOB.39.29	its eyes detect it from afar.
JOB.39.30	Its young ones feast on blood,
JOB.39.30	and where the slain are, there it is.”
JOB.40.1	The 
JOB.40.2	“Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him?
JOB.40.2	Let him who accuses God answer him!”
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the 
JOB.40.4	“I am unworthy—how can I reply to you?
JOB.40.4	I put my hand over my mouth.
JOB.40.5	I spoke once, but I have no answer—
JOB.40.5	twice, but I will say no more.”
JOB.40.6	Then the 
JOB.40.7	“Brace yourself like a man;
JOB.40.7	I will question you,
JOB.40.7	and you shall answer me.
JOB.40.8	“Would you discredit my justice?
JOB.40.8	Would you condemn me to justify yourself?
JOB.40.9	Do you have an arm like God’s,
JOB.40.9	and can your voice thunder like his?
JOB.40.10	Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor,
JOB.40.10	and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.
JOB.40.11	Unleash the fury of your wrath,
JOB.40.11	look at all who are proud and bring them low,
JOB.40.12	look at all who are proud and humble them,
JOB.40.12	crush the wicked where they stand.
JOB.40.13	Bury them all in the dust together;
JOB.40.13	shroud their faces in the grave.
JOB.40.14	Then I myself will admit to you
JOB.40.14	that your own right hand can save you.
JOB.40.15	“Look at Behemoth,
JOB.40.15	which I made along with you
JOB.40.15	and which feeds on grass like an ox.
JOB.40.16	What strength it has in its loins,
JOB.40.16	what power in the muscles of its belly!
JOB.40.17	Its tail sways like a cedar;
JOB.40.17	the sinews of its thighs are close-knit.
JOB.40.18	Its bones are tubes of bronze,
JOB.40.18	its limbs like rods of iron.
JOB.40.19	It ranks first among the works of God,
JOB.40.19	yet its Maker can approach it with his sword.
JOB.40.20	The hills bring it their produce,
JOB.40.20	and all the wild animals play nearby.
JOB.40.21	Under the lotus plants it lies,
JOB.40.21	hidden among the reeds in the marsh.
JOB.40.22	The lotuses conceal it in their shadow;
JOB.40.22	the poplars by the stream surround it.
JOB.40.23	A raging river does not alarm it;
JOB.40.23	it is secure, though the Jordan should surge against its mouth.
JOB.40.24	Can anyone capture it by the eyes,
JOB.40.24	or trap it and pierce its nose?
JOB.41.1	“Can you pull in Leviathan with a fishhook
JOB.41.1	or tie down its tongue with a rope?
JOB.41.2	Can you put a cord through its nose
JOB.41.2	or pierce its jaw with a hook?
JOB.41.3	Will it keep begging you for mercy?
JOB.41.3	Will it speak to you with gentle words?
JOB.41.4	Will it make an agreement with you
JOB.41.4	for you to take it as your slave for life?
JOB.41.5	Can you make a pet of it like a bird
JOB.41.5	or put it on a leash for the young women in your house?
JOB.41.6	Will traders barter for it?
JOB.41.6	Will they divide it up among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Can you fill its hide with harpoons
JOB.41.7	or its head with fishing spears?
JOB.41.8	If you lay a hand on it,
JOB.41.8	you will remember the struggle and never do it again!
JOB.41.9	Any hope of subduing it is false;
JOB.41.9	the mere sight of it is overpowering.
JOB.41.10	No one is fierce enough to rouse it.
JOB.41.10	Who then is able to stand against me?
JOB.41.11	Who has a claim against me that I must pay?
JOB.41.11	Everything under heaven belongs to me.
JOB.41.12	“I will not fail to speak of Leviathan’s limbs,
JOB.41.12	its strength and its graceful form.
JOB.41.13	Who can strip off its outer coat?
JOB.41.13	Who can penetrate its double coat of armor
JOB.41.14	Who dares open the doors of its mouth,
JOB.41.14	ringed about with fearsome teeth?
JOB.41.15	Its back has
JOB.41.15	tightly sealed together;
JOB.41.16	each is so close to the next
JOB.41.16	that no air can pass between.
JOB.41.17	They are joined fast to one another;
JOB.41.17	they cling together and cannot be parted.
JOB.41.18	Its snorting throws out flashes of light;
JOB.41.18	its eyes are like the rays of dawn.
JOB.41.19	Flames stream from its mouth;
JOB.41.19	sparks of fire shoot out.
JOB.41.20	Smoke pours from its nostrils
JOB.41.20	as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.
JOB.41.21	Its breath sets coals ablaze,
JOB.41.21	and flames dart from its mouth.
JOB.41.22	Strength resides in its neck;
JOB.41.22	dismay goes before it.
JOB.41.23	The folds of its flesh are tightly joined;
JOB.41.23	they are firm and immovable.
JOB.41.24	Its chest is hard as rock,
JOB.41.24	hard as a lower millstone.
JOB.41.25	When it rises up, the mighty are terrified;
JOB.41.25	they retreat before its thrashing.
JOB.41.26	The sword that reaches it has no effect,
JOB.41.26	nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.
JOB.41.27	Iron it treats like straw
JOB.41.27	and bronze like rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	Arrows do not make it flee;
JOB.41.28	slingstones are like chaff to it.
JOB.41.29	A club seems to it but a piece of straw;
JOB.41.29	it laughs at the rattling of the lance.
JOB.41.30	Its undersides are jagged potsherds,
JOB.41.30	leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.
JOB.41.31	It makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron
JOB.41.31	and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
JOB.41.32	It leaves a glistening wake behind it;
JOB.41.32	one would think the deep had white hair.
JOB.41.33	Nothing on earth is its equal—
JOB.41.33	a creature without fear.
JOB.41.34	It looks down on all that are haughty;
JOB.41.34	it is king over all that are proud.”
JOB.42.1	Then Job replied to the 
JOB.42.2	“I know that you can do all things;
JOB.42.2	no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
JOB.42.3	You asked, ‘Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?’
JOB.42.3	Surely I spoke of things I did not understand,
JOB.42.3	things too wonderful for me to know.
JOB.42.4	“You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak;
JOB.42.4	I will question you,
JOB.42.4	and you shall answer me.’
JOB.42.5	My ears had heard of you
JOB.42.5	but now my eyes have seen you.
JOB.42.6	Therefore I despise myself
JOB.42.6	and repent in dust and ashes.”
JOB.42.7	After the 
JOB.42.8	So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has.” 
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the 
JOB.42.10	After Job had prayed for his friends, the 
JOB.42.11	All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the 
JOB.42.12	The 
JOB.42.13	And he also had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch. 
JOB.42.15	Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.
JOB.42.16	After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. 
JOB.42.17	And so Job died, an old man and full of years.
PSA.1.1	Blessed is the one
PSA.1.1	who does not walk in step with the wicked
PSA.1.1	or stand in the way that sinners take
PSA.1.1	or sit in the company of mockers,
PSA.1.2	but whose delight is in the law of the 
PSA.1.2	and who meditates on his law day and night.
PSA.1.3	That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
PSA.1.3	which yields its fruit in season
PSA.1.3	and whose leaf does not wither—
PSA.1.3	whatever they do prospers.
PSA.1.4	Not so the wicked!
PSA.1.4	They are like chaff
PSA.1.4	that the wind blows away.
PSA.1.5	Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
PSA.1.5	nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
PSA.1.6	For the 
PSA.1.6	but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
PSA.2.1	Why do the nations conspire
PSA.2.1	and the peoples plot in vain?
PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth rise up
PSA.2.2	and the rulers band together
PSA.2.2	against the 
PSA.2.3	“Let us break their chains
PSA.2.3	and throw off their shackles.”
PSA.2.4	The One enthroned in heaven laughs;
PSA.2.4	the Lord scoffs at them.
PSA.2.5	He rebukes them in his anger
PSA.2.5	and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,
PSA.2.6	“I have installed my king
PSA.2.6	on Zion, my holy mountain.”
PSA.2.7	I will proclaim the 
PSA.2.7	He said to me, “You are my son;
PSA.2.7	today I have become your father.
PSA.2.8	Ask me,
PSA.2.8	and I will make the nations your inheritance,
PSA.2.8	the ends of the earth your possession.
PSA.2.9	You will break them with a rod of iron
PSA.2.9	you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”
PSA.2.10	Therefore, you kings, be wise;
PSA.2.10	be warned, you rulers of the earth.
PSA.2.11	Serve the 
PSA.2.11	and celebrate his rule with trembling.
PSA.2.12	Kiss his son, or he will be angry
PSA.2.12	and your way will lead to your destruction,
PSA.2.12	for his wrath can flare up in a moment.
PSA.2.12	Blessed are all who take refuge in him.
PSA.3.1	How many rise up against me!
PSA.3.2	Many are saying of me,
PSA.3.2	“God will not deliver him.”
PSA.3.3	But you, 
PSA.3.3	my glory, the One who lifts my head high.
PSA.3.4	I call out to the 
PSA.3.4	and he answers me from his holy mountain.
PSA.3.5	I lie down and sleep;
PSA.3.5	I wake again, because the 
PSA.3.6	I will not fear though tens of thousands
PSA.3.6	assail me on every side.
PSA.3.7	Arise, 
PSA.3.7	Deliver me, my God!
PSA.3.7	Strike all my enemies on the jaw;
PSA.3.7	break the teeth of the wicked.
PSA.3.8	From the 
PSA.3.8	May your blessing be on your people.
PSA.4.1	Answer me when I call to you,
PSA.4.1	my righteous God.
PSA.4.1	Give me relief from my distress;
PSA.4.1	have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
PSA.4.2	How long will you people turn my glory into shame?
PSA.4.2	How long will you love delusions and seek false gods
PSA.4.3	Know that the 
PSA.4.3	the 
PSA.4.4	Tremble and
PSA.4.4	when you are on your beds,
PSA.4.4	search your hearts and be silent.
PSA.4.5	Offer the sacrifices of the righteous
PSA.4.5	and trust in the 
PSA.4.6	Many, 
PSA.4.6	Let the light of your face shine on us.
PSA.4.7	Fill my heart with joy
PSA.4.7	when their grain and new wine abound.
PSA.4.8	In peace I will lie down and sleep,
PSA.4.8	for you alone, 
PSA.4.8	make me dwell in safety.
PSA.5.1	Listen to my words, 
PSA.5.1	consider my lament.
PSA.5.2	Hear my cry for help,
PSA.5.2	my King and my God,
PSA.5.2	for to you I pray.
PSA.5.3	In the morning, 
PSA.5.3	in the morning I lay my requests before you
PSA.5.3	and wait expectantly.
PSA.5.4	For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness;
PSA.5.4	with you, evil people are not welcome.
PSA.5.5	The arrogant cannot stand
PSA.5.5	in your presence.
PSA.5.5	You hate all who do wrong;
PSA.5.6	you destroy those who tell lies.
PSA.5.6	The bloodthirsty and deceitful
PSA.5.6	you, 
PSA.5.7	But I, by your great love,
PSA.5.7	can come into your house;
PSA.5.7	in reverence I bow down
PSA.5.7	toward your holy temple.
PSA.5.8	Lead me, 
PSA.5.8	because of my enemies—
PSA.5.8	make your way straight before me.
PSA.5.9	Not a word from their mouth can be trusted;
PSA.5.9	their heart is filled with malice.
PSA.5.9	Their throat is an open grave;
PSA.5.9	with their tongues they tell lies.
PSA.5.10	Declare them guilty, O God!
PSA.5.10	Let their intrigues be their downfall.
PSA.5.10	Banish them for their many sins,
PSA.5.10	for they have rebelled against you.
PSA.5.11	But let all who take refuge in you be glad;
PSA.5.11	let them ever sing for joy.
PSA.5.11	Spread your protection over them,
PSA.5.11	that those who love your name may rejoice in you.
PSA.5.12	Surely, 
PSA.5.12	you surround them with your favor as with a shield.
PSA.6.1	or discipline me in your wrath.
PSA.6.2	Have mercy on me, 
PSA.6.2	heal me, 
PSA.6.3	My soul is in deep anguish.
PSA.6.3	How long, 
PSA.6.4	Turn, 
PSA.6.4	save me because of your unfailing love.
PSA.6.5	Among the dead no one proclaims your name.
PSA.6.5	Who praises you from the grave?
PSA.6.6	I am worn out from my groaning.
PSA.6.6	All night long I flood my bed with weeping
PSA.6.6	and drench my couch with tears.
PSA.6.7	My eyes grow weak with sorrow;
PSA.6.7	they fail because of all my foes.
PSA.6.8	Away from me, all you who do evil,
PSA.6.8	for the 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.9	the 
PSA.6.10	All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish;
PSA.6.10	they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.
PSA.7.1	save and deliver me from all who pursue me,
PSA.7.2	or they will tear me apart like a lion
PSA.7.2	and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
PSA.7.3	and there is guilt on my hands—
PSA.7.4	if I have repaid my ally with evil
PSA.7.4	or without cause have robbed my foe—
PSA.7.5	then let my enemy pursue and overtake me;
PSA.7.5	let him trample my life to the ground
PSA.7.5	and make me sleep in the dust.
PSA.7.6	Arise, 
PSA.7.6	rise up against the rage of my enemies.
PSA.7.6	Awake, my God; decree justice.
PSA.7.7	Let the assembled peoples gather around you,
PSA.7.7	while you sit enthroned over them on high.
PSA.7.8	Let the 
PSA.7.8	Vindicate me, 
PSA.7.8	according to my integrity, O Most High.
PSA.7.9	Bring to an end the violence of the wicked
PSA.7.9	and make the righteous secure—
PSA.7.9	you, the righteous God
PSA.7.9	who probes minds and hearts.
PSA.7.10	My shield
PSA.7.10	who saves the upright in heart.
PSA.7.11	God is a righteous judge,
PSA.7.11	a God who displays his wrath every day.
PSA.7.12	If he does not relent,
PSA.7.12	he
PSA.7.12	he will bend and string his bow.
PSA.7.13	He has prepared his deadly weapons;
PSA.7.13	he makes ready his flaming arrows.
PSA.7.14	Whoever is pregnant with evil
PSA.7.14	conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment.
PSA.7.15	Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out
PSA.7.15	falls into the pit they have made.
PSA.7.16	The trouble they cause recoils on them;
PSA.7.16	their violence comes down on their own heads.
PSA.7.17	I will give thanks to the 
PSA.7.17	I will sing the praises of the name of the 
PSA.8.1	how majestic is your name in all the earth!
PSA.8.1	You have set your glory
PSA.8.1	in the heavens.
PSA.8.2	Through the praise of children and infants
PSA.8.2	you have established a stronghold against your enemies,
PSA.8.2	to silence the foe and the avenger.
PSA.8.3	When I consider your heavens,
PSA.8.3	the work of your fingers,
PSA.8.3	the moon and the stars,
PSA.8.3	which you have set in place,
PSA.8.4	what is mankind that you are mindful of them,
PSA.8.4	human beings that you care for them?
PSA.8.5	You have made them
PSA.8.5	and crowned them
PSA.8.6	You made them rulers over the works of your hands;
PSA.8.6	you put everything under their
PSA.8.7	all flocks and herds,
PSA.8.7	and the animals of the wild,
PSA.8.8	the birds in the sky,
PSA.8.8	and the fish in the sea,
PSA.8.8	all that swim the paths of the seas.
PSA.8.9	how majestic is your name in all the earth!
PSA.9.1	I will give thanks to you, 
PSA.9.1	I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
PSA.9.2	I will be glad and rejoice in you;
PSA.9.2	I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High.
PSA.9.3	My enemies turn back;
PSA.9.3	they stumble and perish before you.
PSA.9.4	For you have upheld my right and my cause,
PSA.9.4	sitting enthroned as the righteous judge.
PSA.9.5	You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked;
PSA.9.5	you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
PSA.9.6	Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies,
PSA.9.6	you have uprooted their cities;
PSA.9.6	even the memory of them has perished.
PSA.9.7	The 
PSA.9.7	he has established his throne for judgment.
PSA.9.8	He rules the world in righteousness
PSA.9.8	and judges the peoples with equity.
PSA.9.9	The 
PSA.9.9	a stronghold in times of trouble.
PSA.9.10	Those who know your name trust in you,
PSA.9.10	for you, 
PSA.9.11	Sing the praises of the 
PSA.9.11	proclaim among the nations what he has done.
PSA.9.12	For he who avenges blood remembers;
PSA.9.12	he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted.
PSA.9.13	Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,
PSA.9.14	that I may declare your praises
PSA.9.14	in the gates of Daughter Zion,
PSA.9.14	and there rejoice in your salvation.
PSA.9.15	The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug;
PSA.9.15	their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
PSA.9.16	The 
PSA.9.16	the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.
PSA.9.17	The wicked go down to the realm of the dead,
PSA.9.17	all the nations that forget God.
PSA.9.18	But God will never forget the needy;
PSA.9.18	the hope of the afflicted will never perish.
PSA.9.19	Arise, 
PSA.9.19	let the nations be judged in your presence.
PSA.9.20	Strike them with terror, 
PSA.9.20	let the nations know they are only mortal.
PSA.10.1	Why, 
PSA.10.1	Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
PSA.10.2	In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak,
PSA.10.2	who are caught in the schemes he devises.
PSA.10.3	He boasts about the cravings of his heart;
PSA.10.3	he blesses the greedy and reviles the 
PSA.10.4	In his pride the wicked man does not seek him;
PSA.10.4	in all his thoughts there is no room for God.
PSA.10.5	His ways are always prosperous;
PSA.10.5	your laws are rejected by
PSA.10.5	he sneers at all his enemies.
PSA.10.6	He says to himself, “Nothing will ever shake me.”
PSA.10.6	He swears, “No one will ever do me harm.”
PSA.10.7	His mouth is full of lies and threats;
PSA.10.7	trouble and evil are under his tongue.
PSA.10.8	He lies in wait near the villages;
PSA.10.8	from ambush he murders the innocent.
PSA.10.8	His eyes watch in secret for his victims;
PSA.10.9	like a lion in cover he lies in wait.
PSA.10.9	He lies in wait to catch the helpless;
PSA.10.9	he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.
PSA.10.10	His victims are crushed, they collapse;
PSA.10.10	they fall under his strength.
PSA.10.11	He says to himself, “God will never notice;
PSA.10.11	he covers his face and never sees.”
PSA.10.12	Arise, 
PSA.10.12	Do not forget the helpless.
PSA.10.13	Why does the wicked man revile God?
PSA.10.13	Why does he say to himself,
PSA.10.13	“He won’t call me to account”?
PSA.10.14	But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted;
PSA.10.14	you consider their grief and take it in hand.
PSA.10.14	The victims commit themselves to you;
PSA.10.14	you are the helper of the fatherless.
PSA.10.15	Break the arm of the wicked man;
PSA.10.15	call the evildoer to account for his wickedness
PSA.10.15	that would not otherwise be found out.
PSA.10.16	The 
PSA.10.16	the nations will perish from his land.
PSA.10.17	You, 
PSA.10.17	you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,
PSA.10.18	defending the fatherless and the oppressed,
PSA.10.18	so that mere earthly mortals
PSA.10.18	will never again strike terror.
PSA.11.1	In the 
PSA.11.1	How then can you say to me:
PSA.11.1	“Flee like a bird to your mountain.
PSA.11.2	For look, the wicked bend their bows;
PSA.11.2	they set their arrows against the strings
PSA.11.2	to shoot from the shadows
PSA.11.2	at the upright in heart.
PSA.11.3	When the foundations are being destroyed,
PSA.11.3	what can the righteous do?”
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.4	the 
PSA.11.4	He observes everyone on earth;
PSA.11.4	his eyes examine them.
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.5	but the wicked, those who love violence,
PSA.11.5	he hates with a passion.
PSA.11.6	On the wicked he will rain
PSA.11.6	fiery coals and burning sulfur;
PSA.11.6	a scorching wind will be their lot.
PSA.11.7	For the 
PSA.11.7	he loves justice;
PSA.11.7	the upright will see his face.
PSA.12.1	Help, 
PSA.12.1	those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.
PSA.12.2	Everyone lies to their neighbor;
PSA.12.2	they flatter with their lips
PSA.12.2	but harbor deception in their hearts.
PSA.12.3	May the 
PSA.12.3	and every boastful tongue—
PSA.12.4	those who say,
PSA.12.4	“By our tongues we will prevail;
PSA.12.4	our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?”
PSA.12.5	“Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan,
PSA.12.5	I will now arise,” says the 
PSA.12.5	“I will protect them from those who malign them.”
PSA.12.6	And the words of the 
PSA.12.6	like silver purified in a crucible,
PSA.12.6	like gold
PSA.12.7	You, 
PSA.12.7	and will protect us forever from the wicked,
PSA.12.8	who freely strut about
PSA.12.8	when what is vile is honored by the human race.
PSA.13.1	How long, 
PSA.13.1	How long will you hide your face from me?
PSA.13.2	How long must I wrestle with my thoughts
PSA.13.2	and day after day have sorrow in my heart?
PSA.13.2	How long will my enemy triumph over me?
PSA.13.3	Look on me and answer, 
PSA.13.3	Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death,
PSA.13.4	and my enemy will say, “I have overcome him,”
PSA.13.4	and my foes will rejoice when I fall.
PSA.13.5	But I trust in your unfailing love;
PSA.13.5	my heart rejoices in your salvation.
PSA.13.6	I will sing the 
PSA.13.6	for he has been good to me.
PSA.14.1	The fool
PSA.14.1	“There is no God.”
PSA.14.1	They are corrupt, their deeds are vile;
PSA.14.1	there is no one who does good.
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.2	on all mankind
PSA.14.2	to see if there are any who understand,
PSA.14.2	any who seek God.
PSA.14.3	All have turned away, all have become corrupt;
PSA.14.3	there is no one who does good,
PSA.14.3	not even one.
PSA.14.4	Do all these evildoers know nothing?
PSA.14.4	They devour my people as though eating bread;
PSA.14.4	they never call on the 
PSA.14.5	But there they are, overwhelmed with dread,
PSA.14.5	for God is present in the company of the righteous.
PSA.14.6	You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor,
PSA.14.6	but the 
PSA.14.7	Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!
PSA.14.7	When the 
PSA.14.7	let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
PSA.15.1	Who may live on your holy mountain?
PSA.15.2	The one whose walk is blameless,
PSA.15.2	who does what is righteous,
PSA.15.2	who speaks the truth from their heart;
PSA.15.3	whose tongue utters no slander,
PSA.15.3	who does no wrong to a neighbor,
PSA.15.3	and casts no slur on others;
PSA.15.4	who despises a vile person
PSA.15.4	but honors those who fear the 
PSA.15.4	who keeps an oath even when it hurts,
PSA.15.4	and does not change their mind;
PSA.15.5	who lends money to the poor without interest;
PSA.15.5	who does not accept a bribe against the innocent.
PSA.15.5	Whoever does these things
PSA.15.5	will never be shaken.
PSA.16.1	Keep me safe, my God,
PSA.16.1	for in you I take refuge.
PSA.16.2	I say to the 
PSA.16.2	apart from you I have no good thing.”
PSA.16.3	I say of the holy people who are in the land,
PSA.16.3	“They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.”
PSA.16.4	Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more.
PSA.16.4	I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods
PSA.16.4	or take up their names on my lips.
PSA.16.5	you make my lot secure.
PSA.16.6	The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;
PSA.16.6	surely I have a delightful inheritance.
PSA.16.7	I will praise the 
PSA.16.7	even at night my heart instructs me.
PSA.16.8	I keep my eyes always on the 
PSA.16.8	With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
PSA.16.9	Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
PSA.16.9	my body also will rest secure,
PSA.16.10	because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,
PSA.16.10	nor will you let your faithful
PSA.16.11	You make known to me the path of life;
PSA.16.11	you will fill me with joy in your presence,
PSA.16.11	with eternal pleasures at your right hand.
PSA.17.1	Hear me, 
PSA.17.1	listen to my cry.
PSA.17.1	Hear my prayer—
PSA.17.1	it does not rise from deceitful lips.
PSA.17.2	Let my vindication come from you;
PSA.17.2	may your eyes see what is right.
PSA.17.3	Though you probe my heart,
PSA.17.3	though you examine me at night and test me,
PSA.17.3	you will find that I have planned no evil;
PSA.17.3	my mouth has not transgressed.
PSA.17.4	Though people tried to bribe me,
PSA.17.4	I have kept myself from the ways of the violent
PSA.17.4	through what your lips have commanded.
PSA.17.5	My steps have held to your paths;
PSA.17.5	my feet have not stumbled.
PSA.17.6	I call on you, my God, for you will answer me;
PSA.17.6	turn your ear to me and hear my prayer.
PSA.17.7	Show me the wonders of your great love,
PSA.17.7	you who save by your right hand
PSA.17.7	those who take refuge in you from their foes.
PSA.17.8	Keep me as the apple of your eye;
PSA.17.8	hide me in the shadow of your wings
PSA.17.9	from the wicked who are out to destroy me,
PSA.17.9	from my mortal enemies who surround me.
PSA.17.10	They close up their callous hearts,
PSA.17.10	and their mouths speak with arrogance.
PSA.17.11	They have tracked me down, they now surround me,
PSA.17.11	with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground.
PSA.17.12	They are like a lion hungry for prey,
PSA.17.12	like a fierce lion crouching in cover.
PSA.17.13	Rise up, 
PSA.17.13	with your sword rescue me from the wicked.
PSA.17.14	By your hand save me from such people, 
PSA.17.14	from those of this world whose reward is in this life.
PSA.17.14	May what you have stored up for the wicked fill their bellies;
PSA.17.14	may their children gorge themselves on it,
PSA.17.14	and may there be leftovers for their little ones.
PSA.17.15	As for me, I will be vindicated and will see your face;
PSA.17.15	when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.
PSA.18.1	I love you, 
PSA.18.2	The 
PSA.18.2	my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,
PSA.18.2	my shield
PSA.18.3	I called to the 
PSA.18.3	and I have been saved from my enemies.
PSA.18.4	The cords of death entangled me;
PSA.18.4	the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
PSA.18.5	The cords of the grave coiled around me;
PSA.18.5	the snares of death confronted me.
PSA.18.6	In my distress I called to the 
PSA.18.6	I cried to my God for help.
PSA.18.6	From his temple he heard my voice;
PSA.18.6	my cry came before him, into his ears.
PSA.18.7	The earth trembled and quaked,
PSA.18.7	and the foundations of the mountains shook;
PSA.18.7	they trembled because he was angry.
PSA.18.8	Smoke rose from his nostrils;
PSA.18.8	consuming fire came from his mouth,
PSA.18.8	burning coals blazed out of it.
PSA.18.9	He parted the heavens and came down;
PSA.18.9	dark clouds were under his feet.
PSA.18.10	He mounted the cherubim and flew;
PSA.18.10	he soared on the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him—
PSA.18.11	the dark rain clouds of the sky.
PSA.18.12	Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced,
PSA.18.12	with hailstones and bolts of lightning.
PSA.18.13	The 
PSA.18.13	the voice of the Most High resounded.
PSA.18.14	He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy,
PSA.18.14	with great bolts of lightning he routed them.
PSA.18.15	The valleys of the sea were exposed
PSA.18.15	and the foundations of the earth laid bare
PSA.18.15	at your rebuke, 
PSA.18.15	at the blast of breath from your nostrils.
PSA.18.16	He reached down from on high and took hold of me;
PSA.18.16	he drew me out of deep waters.
PSA.18.17	He rescued me from my powerful enemy,
PSA.18.17	from my foes, who were too strong for me.
PSA.18.18	They confronted me in the day of my disaster,
PSA.18.18	but the 
PSA.18.19	He brought me out into a spacious place;
PSA.18.19	he rescued me because he delighted in me.
PSA.18.20	The 
PSA.18.20	according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
PSA.18.21	For I have kept the ways of the 
PSA.18.21	I am not guilty of turning from my God.
PSA.18.22	All his laws are before me;
PSA.18.22	I have not turned away from his decrees.
PSA.18.23	I have been blameless before him
PSA.18.23	and have kept myself from sin.
PSA.18.24	The 
PSA.18.24	according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
PSA.18.25	To the faithful you show yourself faithful,
PSA.18.25	to the blameless you show yourself blameless,
PSA.18.26	to the pure you show yourself pure,
PSA.18.26	but to the devious you show yourself shrewd.
PSA.18.27	You save the humble
PSA.18.27	but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.
PSA.18.28	You, 
PSA.18.28	my God turns my darkness into light.
PSA.18.29	With your help I can advance against a troop
PSA.18.29	with my God I can scale a wall.
PSA.18.30	As for God, his way is perfect:
PSA.18.30	The 
PSA.18.30	he shields all who take refuge in him.
PSA.18.31	For who is God besides the 
PSA.18.31	And who is the Rock except our God?
PSA.18.32	It is God who arms me with strength
PSA.18.32	and keeps my way secure.
PSA.18.33	He makes my feet like the feet of a deer;
PSA.18.33	he causes me to stand on the heights.
PSA.18.34	He trains my hands for battle;
PSA.18.34	my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
PSA.18.35	You make your saving help my shield,
PSA.18.35	and your right hand sustains me;
PSA.18.35	your help has made me great.
PSA.18.36	You provide a broad path for my feet,
PSA.18.36	so that my ankles do not give way.
PSA.18.37	I pursued my enemies and overtook them;
PSA.18.37	I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
PSA.18.38	I crushed them so that they could not rise;
PSA.18.38	they fell beneath my feet.
PSA.18.39	You armed me with strength for battle;
PSA.18.39	you humbled my adversaries before me.
PSA.18.40	You made my enemies turn their backs in flight,
PSA.18.40	and I destroyed my foes.
PSA.18.41	They cried for help, but there was no one to save them—
PSA.18.41	to the 
PSA.18.42	I beat them as fine as windblown dust;
PSA.18.42	I trampled them
PSA.18.43	You have delivered me from the attacks of the people;
PSA.18.43	you have made me the head of nations.
PSA.18.43	People I did not know now serve me,
PSA.18.44	foreigners cower before me;
PSA.18.44	as soon as they hear of me, they obey me.
PSA.18.45	They all lose heart;
PSA.18.45	they come trembling from their strongholds.
PSA.18.46	The 
PSA.18.46	Exalted be God my Savior!
PSA.18.47	He is the God who avenges me,
PSA.18.47	who subdues nations under me,
PSA.18.48	who saves me from my enemies.
PSA.18.48	You exalted me above my foes;
PSA.18.48	from a violent man you rescued me.
PSA.18.49	Therefore I will praise you, 
PSA.18.49	I will sing the praises of your name.
PSA.18.50	He gives his king great victories;
PSA.18.50	he shows unfailing love to his anointed,
PSA.18.50	to David and to his descendants forever.
PSA.19.1	The heavens declare the glory of God;
PSA.19.1	the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
PSA.19.2	Day after day they pour forth speech;
PSA.19.2	night after night they reveal knowledge.
PSA.19.3	They have no speech, they use no words;
PSA.19.3	no sound is heard from them.
PSA.19.4	Yet their voice
PSA.19.4	their words to the ends of the world.
PSA.19.4	In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.
PSA.19.5	It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
PSA.19.5	like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
PSA.19.6	It rises at one end of the heavens
PSA.19.6	and makes its circuit to the other;
PSA.19.6	nothing is deprived of its warmth.
PSA.19.7	The law of the 
PSA.19.7	refreshing the soul.
PSA.19.7	The statutes of the 
PSA.19.7	making wise the simple.
PSA.19.8	The precepts of the 
PSA.19.8	giving joy to the heart.
PSA.19.8	The commands of the 
PSA.19.8	giving light to the eyes.
PSA.19.9	The fear of the 
PSA.19.9	enduring forever.
PSA.19.9	The decrees of the 
PSA.19.9	and all of them are righteous.
PSA.19.10	They are more precious than gold,
PSA.19.10	than much pure gold;
PSA.19.10	they are sweeter than honey,
PSA.19.10	than honey from the honeycomb.
PSA.19.11	By them your servant is warned;
PSA.19.11	in keeping them there is great reward.
PSA.19.12	But who can discern their own errors?
PSA.19.12	Forgive my hidden faults.
PSA.19.13	Keep your servant also from willful sins;
PSA.19.13	may they not rule over me.
PSA.19.13	Then I will be blameless,
PSA.19.13	innocent of great transgression.
PSA.19.14	May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart
PSA.19.14	be pleasing in your sight,
PSA.20.1	May the 
PSA.20.1	may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
PSA.20.2	May he send you help from the sanctuary
PSA.20.2	and grant you support from Zion.
PSA.20.3	May he remember all your sacrifices
PSA.20.3	and accept your burnt offerings.
PSA.20.4	May he give you the desire of your heart
PSA.20.4	and make all your plans succeed.
PSA.20.5	May we shout for joy over your victory
PSA.20.5	and lift up our banners in the name of our God.
PSA.20.5	May the 
PSA.20.6	Now this I know:
PSA.20.6	The 
PSA.20.6	He answers him from his heavenly sanctuary
PSA.20.6	with the victorious power of his right hand.
PSA.20.7	Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
PSA.20.7	but we trust in the name of the 
PSA.20.8	They are brought to their knees and fall,
PSA.20.8	but we rise up and stand firm.
PSA.20.9	Answer us when we call!
PSA.21.1	The king rejoices in your strength, 
PSA.21.1	How great is his joy in the victories you give!
PSA.21.2	You have granted him his heart’s desire
PSA.21.2	and have not withheld the request of his lips.
PSA.21.3	You came to greet him with rich blessings
PSA.21.3	and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.
PSA.21.4	He asked you for life, and you gave it to him—
PSA.21.4	length of days, for ever and ever.
PSA.21.5	Through the victories you gave, his glory is great;
PSA.21.5	you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.
PSA.21.6	Surely you have granted him unending blessings
PSA.21.6	and made him glad with the joy of your presence.
PSA.21.7	For the king trusts in the 
PSA.21.7	through the unfailing love of the Most High
PSA.21.7	he will not be shaken.
PSA.21.8	Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies;
PSA.21.8	your right hand will seize your foes.
PSA.21.9	When you appear for battle,
PSA.21.9	you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace.
PSA.21.9	The 
PSA.21.9	and his fire will consume them.
PSA.21.10	You will destroy their descendants from the earth,
PSA.21.10	their posterity from mankind.
PSA.21.11	Though they plot evil against you
PSA.21.11	and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed.
PSA.21.12	You will make them turn their backs
PSA.21.12	when you aim at them with drawn bow.
PSA.21.13	Be exalted in your strength, 
PSA.21.13	we will sing and praise your might.
PSA.22.1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
PSA.22.1	Why are you so far from saving me,
PSA.22.1	so far from my cries of anguish?
PSA.22.2	My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer,
PSA.22.2	by night, but I find no rest.
PSA.22.3	Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;
PSA.22.3	you are the one Israel praises.
PSA.22.4	In you our ancestors put their trust;
PSA.22.4	they trusted and you delivered them.
PSA.22.5	To you they cried out and were saved;
PSA.22.5	in you they trusted and were not put to shame.
PSA.22.6	But I am a worm and not a man,
PSA.22.6	scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
PSA.22.7	All who see me mock me;
PSA.22.7	they hurl insults, shaking their heads.
PSA.22.8	“He trusts in the 
PSA.22.8	“let the 
PSA.22.8	Let him deliver him,
PSA.22.8	since he delights in him.”
PSA.22.9	Yet you brought me out of the womb;
PSA.22.9	you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.
PSA.22.10	From birth I was cast on you;
PSA.22.10	from my mother’s womb you have been my God.
PSA.22.11	Do not be far from me,
PSA.22.11	for trouble is near
PSA.22.11	and there is no one to help.
PSA.22.12	Many bulls surround me;
PSA.22.12	strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
PSA.22.13	Roaring lions that tear their prey
PSA.22.13	open their mouths wide against me.
PSA.22.14	I am poured out like water,
PSA.22.14	and all my bones are out of joint.
PSA.22.14	My heart has turned to wax;
PSA.22.14	it has melted within me.
PSA.22.15	My mouth
PSA.22.15	and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth;
PSA.22.15	you lay me in the dust of death.
PSA.22.16	Dogs surround me,
PSA.22.16	a pack of villains encircles me;
PSA.22.16	they pierce
PSA.22.17	All my bones are on display;
PSA.22.17	people stare and gloat over me.
PSA.22.18	They divide my clothes among them
PSA.22.18	and cast lots for my garment.
PSA.22.19	But you, 
PSA.22.19	You are my strength; come quickly to help me.
PSA.22.20	Deliver me from the sword,
PSA.22.20	my precious life from the power of the dogs.
PSA.22.21	Rescue me from the mouth of the lions;
PSA.22.21	save me from the horns of the wild oxen.
PSA.22.22	I will declare your name to my people;
PSA.22.22	in the assembly I will praise you.
PSA.22.23	You who fear the 
PSA.22.23	All you descendants of Jacob, honor him!
PSA.22.23	Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!
PSA.22.24	For he has not despised or scorned
PSA.22.24	the suffering of the afflicted one;
PSA.22.24	he has not hidden his face from him
PSA.22.24	but has listened to his cry for help.
PSA.22.25	From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly;
PSA.22.25	before those who fear you
PSA.22.26	The poor will eat and be satisfied;
PSA.22.26	those who seek the 
PSA.22.26	may your hearts live forever!
PSA.22.27	All the ends of the earth
PSA.22.27	will remember and turn to the 
PSA.22.27	and all the families of the nations
PSA.22.27	will bow down before him,
PSA.22.28	for dominion belongs to the 
PSA.22.28	and he rules over the nations.
PSA.22.29	All the rich of the earth will feast and worship;
PSA.22.29	all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—
PSA.22.29	those who cannot keep themselves alive.
PSA.22.30	Posterity will serve him;
PSA.22.30	future generations will be told about the Lord.
PSA.22.31	They will proclaim his righteousness,
PSA.22.31	declaring to a people yet unborn:
PSA.22.31	He has done it!
PSA.23.1	The 
PSA.23.2	He makes me lie down in green pastures,
PSA.23.2	he leads me beside quiet waters,
PSA.23.3	he refreshes my soul.
PSA.23.3	He guides me along the right paths
PSA.23.3	for his name’s sake.
PSA.23.4	Even though I walk
PSA.23.4	through the darkest valley,
PSA.23.4	I will fear no evil,
PSA.23.4	for you are with me;
PSA.23.4	your rod and your staff,
PSA.23.4	they comfort me.
PSA.23.5	You prepare a table before me
PSA.23.5	in the presence of my enemies.
PSA.23.5	You anoint my head with oil;
PSA.23.5	my cup overflows.
PSA.23.6	Surely your goodness and love will follow me
PSA.23.6	all the days of my life,
PSA.23.6	and I will dwell in the house of the 
PSA.23.6	forever.
PSA.24.1	The earth is the 
PSA.24.1	the world, and all who live in it;
PSA.24.2	for he founded it on the seas
PSA.24.2	and established it on the waters.
PSA.24.3	Who may ascend the mountain of the 
PSA.24.3	Who may stand in his holy place?
PSA.24.4	The one who has clean hands and a pure heart,
PSA.24.4	who does not trust in an idol
PSA.24.4	or swear by a false god.
PSA.24.5	They will receive blessing from the 
PSA.24.5	and vindication from God their Savior.
PSA.24.6	Such is the generation of those who seek him,
PSA.24.6	who seek your face, God of Jacob.
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, you gates;
PSA.24.7	be lifted up, you ancient doors,
PSA.24.7	that the King of glory may come in.
PSA.24.8	Who is this King of glory?
PSA.24.8	The 
PSA.24.8	the 
PSA.24.9	Lift up your heads, you gates;
PSA.24.9	lift them up, you ancient doors,
PSA.24.9	that the King of glory may come in.
PSA.24.10	Who is he, this King of glory?
PSA.24.10	The 
PSA.24.10	he is the King of glory.
PSA.25.1	In you, 
PSA.25.1	I put my trust.
PSA.25.2	I trust in you;
PSA.25.2	do not let me be put to shame,
PSA.25.2	nor let my enemies triumph over me.
PSA.25.3	No one who hopes in you
PSA.25.3	will ever be put to shame,
PSA.25.3	but shame will come on those
PSA.25.3	who are treacherous without cause.
PSA.25.4	Show me your ways, 
PSA.25.4	teach me your paths.
PSA.25.5	Guide me in your truth and teach me,
PSA.25.5	for you are God my Savior,
PSA.25.5	and my hope is in you all day long.
PSA.25.6	Remember, 
PSA.25.6	for they are from of old.
PSA.25.7	Do not remember the sins of my youth
PSA.25.7	and my rebellious ways;
PSA.25.7	according to your love remember me,
PSA.25.7	for you, 
PSA.25.8	Good and upright is the 
PSA.25.8	therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.
PSA.25.9	He guides the humble in what is right
PSA.25.9	and teaches them his way.
PSA.25.10	All the ways of the 
PSA.25.10	toward those who keep the demands of his covenant.
PSA.25.11	For the sake of your name, 
PSA.25.11	forgive my iniquity, though it is great.
PSA.25.12	Who, then, are those who fear the 
PSA.25.12	He will instruct them in the ways they should choose.
PSA.25.13	They will spend their days in prosperity,
PSA.25.13	and their descendants will inherit the land.
PSA.25.14	The 
PSA.25.14	he makes his covenant known to them.
PSA.25.15	My eyes are ever on the 
PSA.25.15	for only he will release my feet from the snare.
PSA.25.16	Turn to me and be gracious to me,
PSA.25.16	for I am lonely and afflicted.
PSA.25.17	Relieve the troubles of my heart
PSA.25.17	and free me from my anguish.
PSA.25.18	Look on my affliction and my distress
PSA.25.18	and take away all my sins.
PSA.25.19	See how numerous are my enemies
PSA.25.19	and how fiercely they hate me!
PSA.25.20	Guard my life and rescue me;
PSA.25.20	do not let me be put to shame,
PSA.25.20	for I take refuge in you.
PSA.25.21	May integrity and uprightness protect me,
PSA.25.21	because my hope, 
PSA.25.22	Deliver Israel, O God,
PSA.25.22	from all their troubles!
PSA.26.1	Vindicate me, 
PSA.26.1	for I have led a blameless life;
PSA.26.1	I have trusted in the 
PSA.26.1	and have not faltered.
PSA.26.2	Test me, 
PSA.26.2	examine my heart and my mind;
PSA.26.3	for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love
PSA.26.3	and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness.
PSA.26.4	I do not sit with the deceitful,
PSA.26.4	nor do I associate with hypocrites.
PSA.26.5	I abhor the assembly of evildoers
PSA.26.5	and refuse to sit with the wicked.
PSA.26.6	I wash my hands in innocence,
PSA.26.6	and go about your altar, 
PSA.26.7	proclaiming aloud your praise
PSA.26.7	and telling of all your wonderful deeds.
PSA.26.8	the place where your glory dwells.
PSA.26.9	Do not take away my soul along with sinners,
PSA.26.9	my life with those who are bloodthirsty,
PSA.26.10	in whose hands are wicked schemes,
PSA.26.10	whose right hands are full of bribes.
PSA.26.11	I lead a blameless life;
PSA.26.11	deliver me and be merciful to me.
PSA.26.12	My feet stand on level ground;
PSA.26.12	in the great congregation I will praise the 
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	whom shall I fear?
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	of whom shall I be afraid?
PSA.27.2	When the wicked advance against me
PSA.27.2	to devour
PSA.27.2	it is my enemies and my foes
PSA.27.2	who will stumble and fall.
PSA.27.3	Though an army besiege me,
PSA.27.3	my heart will not fear;
PSA.27.3	though war break out against me,
PSA.27.3	even then I will be confident.
PSA.27.4	One thing I ask from the 
PSA.27.4	this only do I seek:
PSA.27.4	that I may dwell in the house of the 
PSA.27.4	all the days of my life,
PSA.27.4	to gaze on the beauty of the 
PSA.27.4	and to seek him in his temple.
PSA.27.5	For in the day of trouble
PSA.27.5	he will keep me safe in his dwelling;
PSA.27.5	he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent
PSA.27.5	and set me high upon a rock.
PSA.27.6	Then my head will be exalted
PSA.27.6	above the enemies who surround me;
PSA.27.6	at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy;
PSA.27.6	I will sing and make music to the 
PSA.27.7	Hear my voice when I call, 
PSA.27.7	be merciful to me and answer me.
PSA.27.8	My heart says of you, “Seek his face!”
PSA.27.8	Your face, 
PSA.27.9	Do not hide your face from me,
PSA.27.9	do not turn your servant away in anger;
PSA.27.9	you have been my helper.
PSA.27.9	Do not reject me or forsake me,
PSA.27.9	God my Savior.
PSA.27.10	Though my father and mother forsake me,
PSA.27.10	the 
PSA.27.11	Teach me your way, 
PSA.27.11	lead me in a straight path
PSA.27.11	because of my oppressors.
PSA.27.12	Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes,
PSA.27.12	for false witnesses rise up against me,
PSA.27.12	spouting malicious accusations.
PSA.27.13	I remain confident of this:
PSA.27.13	I will see the goodness of the 
PSA.27.13	in the land of the living.
PSA.27.14	Wait for the 
PSA.27.14	be strong and take heart
PSA.27.14	and wait for the 
PSA.28.1	To you, 
PSA.28.1	you are my Rock,
PSA.28.1	do not turn a deaf ear to me.
PSA.28.1	For if you remain silent,
PSA.28.1	I will be like those who go down to the pit.
PSA.28.2	Hear my cry for mercy
PSA.28.2	as I call to you for help,
PSA.28.2	as I lift up my hands
PSA.28.2	toward your Most Holy Place.
PSA.28.3	Do not drag me away with the wicked,
PSA.28.3	with those who do evil,
PSA.28.3	who speak cordially with their neighbors
PSA.28.3	but harbor malice in their hearts.
PSA.28.4	Repay them for their deeds
PSA.28.4	and for their evil work;
PSA.28.4	repay them for what their hands have done
PSA.28.4	and bring back on them what they deserve.
PSA.28.5	Because they have no regard for the deeds of the 
PSA.28.5	and what his hands have done,
PSA.28.5	he will tear them down
PSA.28.5	and never build them up again.
PSA.28.6	Praise be to the 
PSA.28.6	for he has heard my cry for mercy.
PSA.28.7	The 
PSA.28.7	my heart trusts in him, and he helps me.
PSA.28.7	My heart leaps for joy,
PSA.28.7	and with my song I praise him.
PSA.28.8	The 
PSA.28.8	a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
PSA.28.9	Save your people and bless your inheritance;
PSA.28.9	be their shepherd and carry them forever.

PSA.29.9	And in his temple all cry, “Glory!”
PSA.29.10	The 
PSA.29.10	the 
PSA.29.11	The 
PSA.29.11	the 
PSA.30.1	I will exalt you, 
PSA.30.1	for you lifted me out of the depths
PSA.30.1	and did not let my enemies gloat over me.
PSA.30.2	and you healed me.
PSA.30.3	You, 
PSA.30.3	you spared me from going down to the pit.
PSA.30.4	Sing the praises of the 
PSA.30.4	praise his holy name.
PSA.30.5	For his anger lasts only a moment,
PSA.30.5	but his favor lasts a lifetime;
PSA.30.5	weeping may stay for the night,
PSA.30.5	but rejoicing comes in the morning.
PSA.30.6	When I felt secure, I said,
PSA.30.6	“I will never be shaken.”
PSA.30.7	you made my royal mountain
PSA.30.7	but when you hid your face,
PSA.30.7	I was dismayed.
PSA.30.8	To you, 
PSA.30.8	to the Lord I cried for mercy:
PSA.30.9	“What is gained if I am silenced,
PSA.30.9	if I go down to the pit?
PSA.30.9	Will the dust praise you?
PSA.30.9	Will it proclaim your faithfulness?
PSA.30.10	Hear, 
PSA.30.11	You turned my wailing into dancing;
PSA.30.11	you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,
PSA.30.12	that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent.
PSA.31.1	In you, 
PSA.31.1	let me never be put to shame;
PSA.31.1	deliver me in your righteousness.
PSA.31.2	Turn your ear to me,
PSA.31.2	come quickly to my rescue;
PSA.31.2	be my rock of refuge,
PSA.31.2	a strong fortress to save me.
PSA.31.3	Since you are my rock and my fortress,
PSA.31.3	for the sake of your name lead and guide me.
PSA.31.4	Keep me free from the trap that is set for me,
PSA.31.4	for you are my refuge.
PSA.31.5	Into your hands I commit my spirit;
PSA.31.5	deliver me, 
PSA.31.6	I hate those who cling to worthless idols;
PSA.31.6	as for me, I trust in the 
PSA.31.7	I will be glad and rejoice in your love,
PSA.31.7	for you saw my affliction
PSA.31.7	and knew the anguish of my soul.
PSA.31.8	You have not given me into the hands of the enemy
PSA.31.8	but have set my feet in a spacious place.
PSA.31.9	Be merciful to me, 
PSA.31.9	my eyes grow weak with sorrow,
PSA.31.9	my soul and body with grief.
PSA.31.10	My life is consumed by anguish
PSA.31.10	and my years by groaning;
PSA.31.10	my strength fails because of my affliction,
PSA.31.10	and my bones grow weak.
PSA.31.11	Because of all my enemies,
PSA.31.11	I am the utter contempt of my neighbors
PSA.31.11	and an object of dread to my closest friends—
PSA.31.11	those who see me on the street flee from me.
PSA.31.12	I am forgotten as though I were dead;
PSA.31.12	I have become like broken pottery.
PSA.31.13	For I hear many whispering,
PSA.31.13	“Terror on every side!”
PSA.31.13	They conspire against me
PSA.31.13	and plot to take my life.
PSA.31.14	But I trust in you, 
PSA.31.14	I say, “You are my God.”
PSA.31.15	My times are in your hands;
PSA.31.15	deliver me from the hands of my enemies,
PSA.31.15	from those who pursue me.
PSA.31.16	Let your face shine on your servant;
PSA.31.16	save me in your unfailing love.
PSA.31.17	Let me not be put to shame, 
PSA.31.17	for I have cried out to you;
PSA.31.17	but let the wicked be put to shame
PSA.31.17	and be silent in the realm of the dead.
PSA.31.18	Let their lying lips be silenced,
PSA.31.18	for with pride and contempt
PSA.31.18	they speak arrogantly against the righteous.
PSA.31.19	How abundant are the good things
PSA.31.19	that you have stored up for those who fear you,
PSA.31.19	that you bestow in the sight of all,
PSA.31.19	on those who take refuge in you.
PSA.31.20	In the shelter of your presence you hide them
PSA.31.20	from all human intrigues;
PSA.31.20	you keep them safe in your dwelling
PSA.31.20	from accusing tongues.
PSA.31.21	Praise be to the 
PSA.31.21	for he showed me the wonders of his love
PSA.31.21	when I was in a city under siege.
PSA.31.22	In my alarm I said,
PSA.31.22	“I am cut off from your sight!”
PSA.31.22	Yet you heard my cry for mercy
PSA.31.22	when I called to you for help.
PSA.31.23	Love the 
PSA.31.23	The 
PSA.31.23	but the proud he pays back in full.
PSA.31.24	Be strong and take heart,
PSA.31.24	all you who hope in the 
PSA.32.1	Blessed is the one
PSA.32.1	whose transgressions are forgiven,
PSA.32.1	whose sins are covered.
PSA.32.2	Blessed is the one
PSA.32.2	whose sin the 
PSA.32.2	and in whose spirit is no deceit.
PSA.32.3	When I kept silent,
PSA.32.3	my bones wasted away
PSA.32.3	through my groaning all day long.
PSA.32.4	For day and night
PSA.32.4	your hand was heavy on me;
PSA.32.4	my strength was sapped
PSA.32.4	as in the heat of summer.
PSA.32.5	Then I acknowledged my sin to you
PSA.32.5	and did not cover up my iniquity.
PSA.32.5	I said, “I will confess
PSA.32.5	my transgressions to the 
PSA.32.5	And you forgave
PSA.32.5	the guilt of my sin.
PSA.32.6	Therefore let all the faithful pray to you
PSA.32.6	while you may be found;
PSA.32.6	surely the rising of the mighty waters
PSA.32.6	will not reach them.
PSA.32.7	You are my hiding place;
PSA.32.7	you will protect me from trouble
PSA.32.7	and surround me with songs of deliverance.
PSA.32.8	I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;
PSA.32.8	I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.
PSA.32.9	Do not be like the horse or the mule,
PSA.32.9	which have no understanding
PSA.32.9	but must be controlled by bit and bridle
PSA.32.9	or they will not come to you.
PSA.32.10	Many are the woes of the wicked,
PSA.32.10	but the 
PSA.32.10	surrounds the one who trusts in him.
PSA.32.11	Rejoice in the 
PSA.32.11	sing, all you who are upright in heart!
PSA.33.1	Sing joyfully to the 
PSA.33.1	it is fitting for the upright to praise him.
PSA.33.2	Praise the 
PSA.33.2	make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.
PSA.33.3	Sing to him a new song;
PSA.33.3	play skillfully, and shout for joy.
PSA.33.4	For the word of the 
PSA.33.4	he is faithful in all he does.
PSA.33.5	The 
PSA.33.5	the earth is full of his unfailing love.
PSA.33.6	By the word of the 
PSA.33.6	their starry host by the breath of his mouth.
PSA.33.7	He gathers the waters of the sea into jars
PSA.33.7	he puts the deep into storehouses.
PSA.33.8	Let all the earth fear the 
PSA.33.8	let all the people of the world revere him.
PSA.33.9	For he spoke, and it came to be;
PSA.33.9	he commanded, and it stood firm.
PSA.33.10	The 
PSA.33.10	he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.
PSA.33.11	But the plans of the 
PSA.33.11	the purposes of his heart through all generations.
PSA.33.12	Blessed is the nation whose God is the 
PSA.33.12	the people he chose for his inheritance.
PSA.33.13	From heaven the 
PSA.33.13	and sees all mankind;
PSA.33.14	from his dwelling place he watches
PSA.33.14	all who live on earth—
PSA.33.15	he who forms the hearts of all,
PSA.33.15	who considers everything they do.
PSA.33.16	No king is saved by the size of his army;
PSA.33.16	no warrior escapes by his great strength.
PSA.33.17	A horse is a vain hope for deliverance;
PSA.33.17	despite all its great strength it cannot save.
PSA.33.18	But the eyes of the 
PSA.33.18	on those whose hope is in his unfailing love,
PSA.33.19	to deliver them from death
PSA.33.19	and keep them alive in famine.
PSA.33.20	We wait in hope for the 
PSA.33.20	he is our help and our shield.
PSA.33.21	In him our hearts rejoice,
PSA.33.21	for we trust in his holy name.
PSA.33.22	May your unfailing love be with us, 
PSA.33.22	even as we put our hope in you.
PSA.34.1	I will extol the 
PSA.34.1	his praise will always be on my lips.
PSA.34.2	I will glory in the 
PSA.34.2	let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
PSA.34.3	Glorify the 
PSA.34.3	let us exalt his name together.
PSA.34.4	I sought the 
PSA.34.4	he delivered me from all my fears.
PSA.34.5	Those who look to him are radiant;
PSA.34.5	their faces are never covered with shame.
PSA.34.6	This poor man called, and the 
PSA.34.6	he saved him out of all his troubles.
PSA.34.7	The angel of the 
PSA.34.7	and he delivers them.
PSA.34.8	Taste and see that the 
PSA.34.8	blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.
PSA.34.9	Fear the 
PSA.34.9	for those who fear him lack nothing.
PSA.34.10	The lions may grow weak and hungry,
PSA.34.10	but those who seek the 
PSA.34.11	Come, my children, listen to me;
PSA.34.11	I will teach you the fear of the 
PSA.34.12	Whoever of you loves life
PSA.34.12	and desires to see many good days,
PSA.34.13	keep your tongue from evil
PSA.34.13	and your lips from telling lies.
PSA.34.14	Turn from evil and do good;
PSA.34.14	seek peace and pursue it.
PSA.34.15	The eyes of the 
PSA.34.15	and his ears are attentive to their cry;
PSA.34.16	but the face of the 
PSA.34.16	to blot out their name from the earth.
PSA.34.17	The righteous cry out, and the 
PSA.34.17	he delivers them from all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.18	and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
PSA.34.19	The righteous person may have many troubles,
PSA.34.19	but the 
PSA.34.20	he protects all his bones,
PSA.34.20	not one of them will be broken.
PSA.34.21	Evil will slay the wicked;
PSA.34.21	the foes of the righteous will be condemned.
PSA.34.22	The 
PSA.34.22	no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.
PSA.35.1	Contend, 
PSA.35.1	fight against those who fight against me.
PSA.35.2	Take up shield and armor;
PSA.35.2	arise and come to my aid.
PSA.35.3	Brandish spear and javelin
PSA.35.3	against those who pursue me.
PSA.35.3	Say to me,
PSA.35.3	“I am your salvation.”
PSA.35.4	May those who seek my life
PSA.35.4	be disgraced and put to shame;
PSA.35.4	may those who plot my ruin
PSA.35.4	be turned back in dismay.
PSA.35.5	May they be like chaff before the wind,
PSA.35.5	with the angel of the 
PSA.35.6	may their path be dark and slippery,
PSA.35.6	with the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	Since they hid their net for me without cause
PSA.35.7	and without cause dug a pit for me,
PSA.35.8	may ruin overtake them by surprise—
PSA.35.8	may the net they hid entangle them,
PSA.35.8	may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.
PSA.35.9	Then my soul will rejoice in the 
PSA.35.9	and delight in his salvation.
PSA.35.10	My whole being will exclaim,
PSA.35.10	“Who is like you, 
PSA.35.10	You rescue the poor from those too strong for them,
PSA.35.10	the poor and needy from those who rob them.”
PSA.35.11	Ruthless witnesses come forward;
PSA.35.11	they question me on things I know nothing about.
PSA.35.12	They repay me evil for good
PSA.35.12	and leave me like one bereaved.
PSA.35.13	Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth
PSA.35.13	and humbled myself with fasting.
PSA.35.13	When my prayers returned to me unanswered,
PSA.35.14	I went about mourning
PSA.35.14	as though for my friend or brother.
PSA.35.14	I bowed my head in grief
PSA.35.14	as though weeping for my mother.
PSA.35.15	But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee;
PSA.35.15	assailants gathered against me without my knowledge.
PSA.35.15	They slandered me without ceasing.
PSA.35.16	Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked;
PSA.35.16	they gnashed their teeth at me.
PSA.35.17	How long, Lord, will you look on?
PSA.35.17	Rescue me from their ravages,
PSA.35.17	my precious life from these lions.
PSA.35.18	I will give you thanks in the great assembly;
PSA.35.18	among the throngs I will praise you.
PSA.35.19	Do not let those gloat over me
PSA.35.19	who are my enemies without cause;
PSA.35.19	do not let those who hate me without reason
PSA.35.19	maliciously wink the eye.
PSA.35.20	They do not speak peaceably,
PSA.35.20	but devise false accusations
PSA.35.20	against those who live quietly in the land.
PSA.35.21	They sneer at me and say, “Aha! Aha!
PSA.35.21	With our own eyes we have seen it.”
PSA.35.22	Do not be far from me, Lord.
PSA.35.23	Awake, and rise to my defense!
PSA.35.23	Contend for me, my God and Lord.
PSA.35.24	Vindicate me in your righteousness, 
PSA.35.24	do not let them gloat over me.
PSA.35.25	Do not let them think, “Aha, just what we wanted!”
PSA.35.25	or say, “We have swallowed him up.”
PSA.35.26	May all who gloat over my distress
PSA.35.26	be put to shame and confusion;
PSA.35.26	may all who exalt themselves over me
PSA.35.26	be clothed with shame and disgrace.
PSA.35.27	May those who delight in my vindication
PSA.35.27	shout for joy and gladness;
PSA.35.27	may they always say, “The 
PSA.35.27	who delights in the well-being of his servant.”
PSA.35.28	My tongue will proclaim your righteousness,
PSA.35.28	your praises all day long.
PSA.36.1	I have a message from God in my heart
PSA.36.1	concerning the sinfulness of the wicked:
PSA.36.1	There is no fear of God
PSA.36.1	before their eyes.
PSA.36.2	In their own eyes they flatter themselves
PSA.36.2	too much to detect or hate their sin.
PSA.36.3	The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful;
PSA.36.3	they fail to act wisely or do good.
PSA.36.4	Even on their beds they plot evil;
PSA.36.4	they commit themselves to a sinful course
PSA.36.4	and do not reject what is wrong.
PSA.36.5	Your love, 
PSA.36.5	your faithfulness to the skies.
PSA.36.6	Your righteousness is like the highest mountains,
PSA.36.6	your justice like the great deep.
PSA.36.6	You, 
PSA.36.7	How priceless is your unfailing love, O God!
PSA.36.7	People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
PSA.36.8	They feast on the abundance of your house;
PSA.36.8	you give them drink from your river of delights.
PSA.36.9	For with you is the fountain of life;
PSA.36.9	in your light we see light.
PSA.36.10	Continue your love to those who know you,
PSA.36.10	your righteousness to the upright in heart.
PSA.36.11	May the foot of the proud not come against me,
PSA.36.11	nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
PSA.36.12	See how the evildoers lie fallen—
PSA.36.12	thrown down, not able to rise!
PSA.37.1	Do not fret because of those who are evil
PSA.37.1	or be envious of those who do wrong;
PSA.37.2	for like the grass they will soon wither,
PSA.37.2	like green plants they will soon die away.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.3	dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.
PSA.37.4	Take delight in the 
PSA.37.4	and he will give you the desires of your heart.
PSA.37.5	Commit your way to the 
PSA.37.5	trust in him and he will do this:
PSA.37.6	He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn,
PSA.37.6	your vindication like the noonday sun.
PSA.37.7	Be still before the 
PSA.37.7	and wait patiently for him;
PSA.37.7	do not fret when people succeed in their ways,
PSA.37.7	when they carry out their wicked schemes.
PSA.37.8	Refrain from anger and turn from wrath;
PSA.37.8	do not fret—it leads only to evil.
PSA.37.9	For those who are evil will be destroyed,
PSA.37.9	but those who hope in the 
PSA.37.10	A little while, and the wicked will be no more;
PSA.37.10	though you look for them, they will not be found.
PSA.37.11	But the meek will inherit the land
PSA.37.11	and enjoy peace and prosperity.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plot against the righteous
PSA.37.12	and gnash their teeth at them;
PSA.37.13	but the Lord laughs at the wicked,
PSA.37.13	for he knows their day is coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked draw the sword
PSA.37.14	and bend the bow
PSA.37.14	to bring down the poor and needy,
PSA.37.14	to slay those whose ways are upright.
PSA.37.15	But their swords will pierce their own hearts,
PSA.37.15	and their bows will be broken.
PSA.37.16	Better the little that the righteous have
PSA.37.16	than the wealth of many wicked;
PSA.37.17	for the power of the wicked will be broken,
PSA.37.17	but the 
PSA.37.18	The blameless spend their days under the 
PSA.37.18	and their inheritance will endure forever.
PSA.37.19	In times of disaster they will not wither;
PSA.37.19	in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked will perish:
PSA.37.20	Though the 
PSA.37.20	they will be consumed, they will go up in smoke.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrow and do not repay,
PSA.37.21	but the righteous give generously;
PSA.37.22	those the 
PSA.37.22	but those he curses will be destroyed.
PSA.37.23	The 
PSA.37.23	of the one who delights in him;
PSA.37.24	though he may stumble, he will not fall,
PSA.37.24	for the 
PSA.37.25	I was young and now I am old,
PSA.37.25	yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken
PSA.37.25	or their children begging bread.
PSA.37.26	They are always generous and lend freely;
PSA.37.26	their children will be a blessing.
PSA.37.27	Turn from evil and do good;
PSA.37.27	then you will dwell in the land forever.
PSA.37.28	For the 
PSA.37.28	and will not forsake his faithful ones.
PSA.37.28	Wrongdoers will be completely destroyed
PSA.37.28	the offspring of the wicked will perish.
PSA.37.29	The righteous will inherit the land
PSA.37.29	and dwell in it forever.
PSA.37.30	The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom,
PSA.37.30	and their tongues speak what is just.
PSA.37.31	The law of their God is in their hearts;
PSA.37.31	their feet do not slip.
PSA.37.32	The wicked lie in wait for the righteous,
PSA.37.32	intent on putting them to death;
PSA.37.33	but the 
PSA.37.33	or let them be condemned when brought to trial.
PSA.37.34	Hope in the 
PSA.37.34	and keep his way.
PSA.37.34	He will exalt you to inherit the land;
PSA.37.34	when the wicked are destroyed, you will see it.
PSA.37.35	I have seen a wicked and ruthless man
PSA.37.35	flourishing like a luxuriant native tree,
PSA.37.36	but he soon passed away and was no more;
PSA.37.36	though I looked for him, he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	Consider the blameless, observe the upright;
PSA.37.37	a future awaits those who seek peace.
PSA.37.38	But all sinners will be destroyed;
PSA.37.38	there will be no future
PSA.37.39	The salvation of the righteous comes from the 
PSA.37.39	he is their stronghold in time of trouble.
PSA.37.40	The 
PSA.37.40	he delivers them from the wicked and saves them,
PSA.37.40	because they take refuge in him.
PSA.38.1	or discipline me in your wrath.
PSA.38.2	Your arrows have pierced me,
PSA.38.2	and your hand has come down on me.
PSA.38.3	Because of your wrath there is no health in my body;
PSA.38.3	there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	My guilt has overwhelmed me
PSA.38.4	like a burden too heavy to bear.
PSA.38.5	My wounds fester and are loathsome
PSA.38.5	because of my sinful folly.
PSA.38.6	I am bowed down and brought very low;
PSA.38.6	all day long I go about mourning.
PSA.38.7	My back is filled with searing pain;
PSA.38.7	there is no health in my body.
PSA.38.8	I am feeble and utterly crushed;
PSA.38.8	I groan in anguish of heart.
PSA.38.9	All my longings lie open before you, Lord;
PSA.38.9	my sighing is not hidden from you.
PSA.38.10	My heart pounds, my strength fails me;
PSA.38.10	even the light has gone from my eyes.
PSA.38.11	My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds;
PSA.38.11	my neighbors stay far away.
PSA.38.12	Those who want to kill me set their traps,
PSA.38.12	those who would harm me talk of my ruin;
PSA.38.12	all day long they scheme and lie.
PSA.38.13	I am like the deaf, who cannot hear,
PSA.38.13	like the mute, who cannot speak;
PSA.38.14	I have become like one who does not hear,
PSA.38.14	whose mouth can offer no reply.
PSA.38.15	you will answer, Lord my God.
PSA.38.16	For I said, “Do not let them gloat
PSA.38.16	or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip.”
PSA.38.17	For I am about to fall,
PSA.38.17	and my pain is ever with me.
PSA.38.18	I confess my iniquity;
PSA.38.18	I am troubled by my sin.
PSA.38.19	Many have become my enemies without cause
PSA.38.19	those who hate me without reason are numerous.
PSA.38.20	Those who repay my good with evil
PSA.38.20	lodge accusations against me,
PSA.38.20	though I seek only to do what is good.
PSA.38.21	do not be far from me, my God.
PSA.38.22	Come quickly to help me,
PSA.38.22	my Lord and my Savior.
PSA.39.1	I said, “I will watch my ways
PSA.39.1	and keep my tongue from sin;
PSA.39.1	I will put a muzzle on my mouth
PSA.39.1	while in the presence of the wicked.”
PSA.39.2	So I remained utterly silent,
PSA.39.2	not even saying anything good.
PSA.39.2	But my anguish increased;
PSA.39.3	my heart grew hot within me.
PSA.39.3	While I meditated, the fire burned;
PSA.39.3	then I spoke with my tongue:
PSA.39.4	“Show me, 
PSA.39.4	and the number of my days;
PSA.39.4	let me know how fleeting my life is.
PSA.39.5	You have made my days a mere handbreadth;
PSA.39.5	the span of my years is as nothing before you.
PSA.39.5	Everyone is but a breath,
PSA.39.5	even those who seem secure.
PSA.39.6	“Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom;
PSA.39.6	in vain they rush about, heaping up wealth
PSA.39.6	without knowing whose it will finally be.
PSA.39.7	“But now, Lord, what do I look for?
PSA.39.7	My hope is in you.
PSA.39.8	Save me from all my transgressions;
PSA.39.8	do not make me the scorn of fools.
PSA.39.9	I was silent; I would not open my mouth,
PSA.39.9	for you are the one who has done this.
PSA.39.10	Remove your scourge from me;
PSA.39.10	I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
PSA.39.11	When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin,
PSA.39.11	you consume their wealth like a moth—
PSA.39.11	surely everyone is but a breath.
PSA.39.12	“Hear my prayer, 
PSA.39.12	listen to my cry for help;
PSA.39.12	do not be deaf to my weeping.
PSA.39.12	I dwell with you as a foreigner,
PSA.39.12	a stranger, as all my ancestors were.
PSA.39.13	Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again
PSA.39.13	before I depart and am no more.”
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the 
PSA.40.1	he turned to me and heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He lifted me out of the slimy pit,
PSA.40.2	out of the mud and mire;
PSA.40.2	he set my feet on a rock
PSA.40.2	and gave me a firm place to stand.
PSA.40.3	He put a new song in my mouth,
PSA.40.3	a hymn of praise to our God.
PSA.40.3	Many will see and fear the 
PSA.40.3	and put their trust in him.
PSA.40.4	Blessed is the one
PSA.40.4	who trusts in the 
PSA.40.4	who does not look to the proud,
PSA.40.4	to those who turn aside to false gods.
PSA.40.5	Many, 
PSA.40.5	are the wonders you have done,
PSA.40.5	the things you planned for us.
PSA.40.5	None can compare with you;
PSA.40.5	were I to speak and tell of your deeds,
PSA.40.5	they would be too many to declare.
PSA.40.6	Sacrifice and offering you did not desire—
PSA.40.6	but my ears you have opened
PSA.40.6	burnt offerings and sin offerings
PSA.40.7	Then I said, “Here I am, I have come—
PSA.40.7	it is written about me in the scroll.
PSA.40.8	I desire to do your will, my God;
PSA.40.8	your law is within my heart.”
PSA.40.9	I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly;
PSA.40.9	I do not seal my lips, 
PSA.40.9	as you know.
PSA.40.10	I do not hide your righteousness in my heart;
PSA.40.10	I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help.
PSA.40.10	I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness
PSA.40.10	from the great assembly.
PSA.40.11	Do not withhold your mercy from me, 
PSA.40.11	may your love and faithfulness always protect me.
PSA.40.12	For troubles without number surround me;
PSA.40.12	my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.
PSA.40.12	They are more than the hairs of my head,
PSA.40.12	and my heart fails within me.
PSA.40.13	Be pleased to save me, 
PSA.40.13	come quickly, 
PSA.40.14	May all who want to take my life
PSA.40.14	be put to shame and confusion;
PSA.40.14	may all who desire my ruin
PSA.40.14	be turned back in disgrace.
PSA.40.15	May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”
PSA.40.15	be appalled at their own shame.
PSA.40.16	But may all who seek you
PSA.40.16	rejoice and be glad in you;
PSA.40.16	may those who long for your saving help always say,
PSA.40.16	“The 
PSA.40.17	But as for me, I am poor and needy;
PSA.40.17	may the Lord think of me.
PSA.40.17	You are my help and my deliverer;
PSA.40.17	you are my God, do not delay.
PSA.41.1	Blessed are those who have regard for the weak;
PSA.41.1	the 
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.2	they are counted among the blessed in the land—
PSA.41.2	he does not give them over to the desire of their foes.
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.3	and restores them from their bed of illness.
PSA.41.4	I said, “Have mercy on me, 
PSA.41.4	heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
PSA.41.5	My enemies say of me in malice,
PSA.41.5	“When will he die and his name perish?”
PSA.41.6	When one of them comes to see me,
PSA.41.6	he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander;
PSA.41.6	then he goes out and spreads it around.
PSA.41.7	All my enemies whisper together against me;
PSA.41.7	they imagine the worst for me, saying,
PSA.41.8	“A vile disease has afflicted him;
PSA.41.8	he will never get up from the place where he lies.”
PSA.41.9	Even my close friend,
PSA.41.9	someone I trusted,
PSA.41.9	one who shared my bread,
PSA.41.9	has turned
PSA.41.10	But may you have mercy on me, 
PSA.41.10	raise me up, that I may repay them.
PSA.41.11	I know that you are pleased with me,
PSA.41.11	for my enemy does not triumph over me.
PSA.41.12	Because of my integrity you uphold me
PSA.41.12	and set me in your presence forever.
PSA.41.13	Praise be to the 
PSA.41.13	from everlasting to everlasting.
PSA.41.13	Amen and Amen.
PSA.42.1	As the deer pants for streams of water,
PSA.42.1	so my soul pants for you, my God.
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
PSA.42.2	When can I go and meet with God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my food
PSA.42.3	day and night,
PSA.42.3	while people say to me all day long,
PSA.42.3	“Where is your God?”
PSA.42.4	These things I remember
PSA.42.4	as I pour out my soul:
PSA.42.4	how I used to go to the house of God
PSA.42.4	under the protection of the Mighty One
PSA.42.4	with shouts of joy and praise
PSA.42.4	among the festive throng.
PSA.42.5	Why, my soul, are you downcast?
PSA.42.5	Why so disturbed within me?
PSA.42.5	Put your hope in God,
PSA.42.5	for I will yet praise him,
PSA.42.5	my Savior and my God.
PSA.42.6	My soul is downcast within me;
PSA.42.6	therefore I will remember you
PSA.42.6	from the land of the Jordan,
PSA.42.6	the heights of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Deep calls to deep
PSA.42.7	in the roar of your waterfalls;
PSA.42.7	all your waves and breakers
PSA.42.7	have swept over me.
PSA.42.8	By day the 
PSA.42.8	at night his song is with me—
PSA.42.8	a prayer to the God of my life.
PSA.42.9	I say to God my Rock,
PSA.42.9	“Why have you forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why must I go about mourning,
PSA.42.9	oppressed by the enemy?”
PSA.42.10	My bones suffer mortal agony
PSA.42.10	as my foes taunt me,
PSA.42.10	saying to me all day long,
PSA.42.10	“Where is your God?”
PSA.42.11	Why, my soul, are you downcast?
PSA.42.11	Why so disturbed within me?
PSA.42.11	Put your hope in God,
PSA.42.11	for I will yet praise him,
PSA.42.11	my Savior and my God.
PSA.43.1	Vindicate me, my God,
PSA.43.1	and plead my cause
PSA.43.1	against an unfaithful nation.
PSA.43.1	Rescue me from those who are
PSA.43.1	deceitful and wicked.
PSA.43.2	You are God my stronghold.
PSA.43.2	Why have you rejected me?
PSA.43.2	Why must I go about mourning,
PSA.43.2	oppressed by the enemy?
PSA.43.3	Send me your light and your faithful care,
PSA.43.3	let them lead me;
PSA.43.3	let them bring me to your holy mountain,
PSA.43.3	to the place where you dwell.
PSA.43.4	Then I will go to the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	to God, my joy and my delight.
PSA.43.4	I will praise you with the lyre,
PSA.43.4	O God, my God.
PSA.43.5	Why, my soul, are you downcast?
PSA.43.5	Why so disturbed within me?
PSA.43.5	Put your hope in God,
PSA.43.5	for I will yet praise him,
PSA.43.5	my Savior and my God.
PSA.44.1	We have heard it with our ears, O God;
PSA.44.1	our ancestors have told us
PSA.44.1	what you did in their days,
PSA.44.1	in days long ago.
PSA.44.2	With your hand you drove out the nations
PSA.44.2	and planted our ancestors;
PSA.44.2	you crushed the peoples
PSA.44.2	and made our ancestors flourish.
PSA.44.3	It was not by their sword that they won the land,
PSA.44.3	nor did their arm bring them victory;
PSA.44.3	it was your right hand, your arm,
PSA.44.3	and the light of your face, for you loved them.
PSA.44.4	You are my King and my God,
PSA.44.4	who decrees
PSA.44.5	Through you we push back our enemies;
PSA.44.5	through your name we trample our foes.
PSA.44.6	I put no trust in my bow,
PSA.44.6	my sword does not bring me victory;
PSA.44.7	but you give us victory over our enemies,
PSA.44.7	you put our adversaries to shame.
PSA.44.8	In God we make our boast all day long,
PSA.44.8	and we will praise your name forever.
PSA.44.9	But now you have rejected and humbled us;
PSA.44.9	you no longer go out with our armies.
PSA.44.10	You made us retreat before the enemy,
PSA.44.10	and our adversaries have plundered us.
PSA.44.11	You gave us up to be devoured like sheep
PSA.44.11	and have scattered us among the nations.
PSA.44.12	You sold your people for a pittance,
PSA.44.12	gaining nothing from their sale.
PSA.44.13	You have made us a reproach to our neighbors,
PSA.44.13	the scorn and derision of those around us.
PSA.44.14	You have made us a byword among the nations;
PSA.44.14	the peoples shake their heads at us.
PSA.44.15	I live in disgrace all day long,
PSA.44.15	and my face is covered with shame
PSA.44.16	at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me,
PSA.44.16	because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.
PSA.44.17	All this came upon us,
PSA.44.17	though we had not forgotten you;
PSA.44.17	we had not been false to your covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our hearts had not turned back;
PSA.44.18	our feet had not strayed from your path.
PSA.44.19	But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals;
PSA.44.19	you covered us over with deep darkness.
PSA.44.20	If we had forgotten the name of our God
PSA.44.20	or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
PSA.44.21	would not God have discovered it,
PSA.44.21	since he knows the secrets of the heart?
PSA.44.22	Yet for your sake we face death all day long;
PSA.44.22	we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
PSA.44.23	Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep?
PSA.44.23	Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.
PSA.44.24	Why do you hide your face
PSA.44.24	and forget our misery and oppression?
PSA.44.25	We are brought down to the dust;
PSA.44.25	our bodies cling to the ground.
PSA.44.26	Rise up and help us;
PSA.44.26	rescue us because of your unfailing love.
PSA.45.1	My heart is stirred by a noble theme
PSA.45.1	as I recite my verses for the king;
PSA.45.1	my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
PSA.45.2	You are the most excellent of men
PSA.45.2	and your lips have been anointed with grace,
PSA.45.2	since God has blessed you forever.
PSA.45.3	Gird your sword on your side, you mighty one;
PSA.45.3	clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.
PSA.45.4	In your majesty ride forth victoriously
PSA.45.4	in the cause of truth, humility and justice;
PSA.45.4	let your right hand achieve awesome deeds.
PSA.45.5	Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies;
PSA.45.5	let the nations fall beneath your feet.
PSA.45.6	Your throne, O God,
PSA.45.6	a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.
PSA.45.7	You love righteousness and hate wickedness;
PSA.45.7	therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions
PSA.45.7	by anointing you with the oil of joy.
PSA.45.8	All your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia;
PSA.45.8	from palaces adorned with ivory
PSA.45.8	the music of the strings makes you glad.
PSA.45.9	Daughters of kings are among your honored women;
PSA.45.9	at your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Listen, daughter, and pay careful attention:
PSA.45.10	Forget your people and your father’s house.
PSA.45.11	Let the king be enthralled by your beauty;
PSA.45.11	honor him, for he is your lord.
PSA.45.12	The city of Tyre will come with a gift,
PSA.45.12	people of wealth will seek your favor.
PSA.45.13	All glorious is the princess within her chamber;
PSA.45.13	her gown is interwoven with gold.
PSA.45.14	In embroidered garments she is led to the king;
PSA.45.14	her virgin companions follow her—
PSA.45.14	those brought to be with her.
PSA.45.15	Led in with joy and gladness,
PSA.45.15	they enter the palace of the king.
PSA.45.16	Your sons will take the place of your fathers;
PSA.45.16	you will make them princes throughout the land.
PSA.45.17	I will perpetuate your memory through all generations;
PSA.45.17	therefore the nations will praise you for ever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength,
PSA.46.1	an ever-present help in trouble.
PSA.46.2	Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way
PSA.46.2	and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,
PSA.46.3	though its waters roar and foam
PSA.46.3	and the mountains quake with their surging.
PSA.46.4	There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
PSA.46.4	the holy place where the Most High dwells.
PSA.46.5	God is within her, she will not fall;
PSA.46.5	God will help her at break of day.
PSA.46.6	Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall;
PSA.46.6	he lifts his voice, the earth melts.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.7	the God of Jacob is our fortress.
PSA.46.8	Come and see what the 
PSA.46.8	the desolations he has brought on the earth.
PSA.46.9	He makes wars cease
PSA.46.9	to the ends of the earth.
PSA.46.9	He breaks the bow and shatters the spear;
PSA.46.9	he burns the shields
PSA.46.10	He says, “Be still, and know that I am God;
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted among the nations,
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted in the earth.”
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.46.11	the God of Jacob is our fortress.
PSA.47.1	Clap your hands, all you nations;
PSA.47.1	shout to God with cries of joy.
PSA.47.2	For the 
PSA.47.2	the great King over all the earth.
PSA.47.3	He subdued nations under us,
PSA.47.3	peoples under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He chose our inheritance for us,
PSA.47.4	the pride of Jacob, whom he loved.
PSA.47.5	God has ascended amid shouts of joy,
PSA.47.5	the 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God, sing praises;
PSA.47.6	sing praises to our King, sing praises.
PSA.47.7	For God is the King of all the earth;
PSA.47.7	sing to him a psalm of praise.
PSA.47.8	God reigns over the nations;
PSA.47.8	God is seated on his holy throne.
PSA.47.9	The nobles of the nations assemble
PSA.47.9	as the people of the God of Abraham,
PSA.47.9	for the kings
PSA.47.9	he is greatly exalted.
PSA.48.1	Great is the 
PSA.48.1	in the city of our God, his holy mountain.
PSA.48.2	Beautiful in its loftiness,
PSA.48.2	the joy of the whole earth,
PSA.48.2	like the heights of Zaphon
PSA.48.2	the city of the Great King.
PSA.48.3	God is in her citadels;
PSA.48.3	he has shown himself to be her fortress.
PSA.48.4	When the kings joined forces,
PSA.48.4	when they advanced together,
PSA.48.5	they saw her and were astounded;
PSA.48.5	they fled in terror.
PSA.48.6	Trembling seized them there,
PSA.48.6	pain like that of a woman in labor.
PSA.48.7	You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish
PSA.48.7	shattered by an east wind.
PSA.48.8	As we have heard,
PSA.48.8	so we have seen
PSA.48.8	in the city of the 
PSA.48.8	in the city of our God:
PSA.48.8	God makes her secure
PSA.48.8	forever.
PSA.48.9	Within your temple, O God,
PSA.48.9	we meditate on your unfailing love.
PSA.48.10	Like your name, O God,
PSA.48.10	your praise reaches to the ends of the earth;
PSA.48.10	your right hand is filled with righteousness.
PSA.48.11	Mount Zion rejoices,
PSA.48.11	the villages of Judah are glad
PSA.48.11	because of your judgments.
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion, go around her,
PSA.48.12	count her towers,
PSA.48.13	consider well her ramparts,
PSA.48.13	view her citadels,
PSA.48.13	that you may tell of them
PSA.48.13	to the next generation.
PSA.48.14	For this God is our God for ever and ever;
PSA.48.14	he will be our guide even to the end.
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all you peoples;
PSA.49.1	listen, all who live in this world,
PSA.49.2	both low and high,
PSA.49.2	rich and poor alike:
PSA.49.3	My mouth will speak words of wisdom;
PSA.49.3	the meditation of my heart will give you understanding.
PSA.49.4	I will turn my ear to a proverb;
PSA.49.4	with the harp I will expound my riddle:
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear when evil days come,
PSA.49.5	when wicked deceivers surround me—
PSA.49.6	those who trust in their wealth
PSA.49.6	and boast of their great riches?
PSA.49.7	No one can redeem the life of another
PSA.49.7	or give to God a ransom for them—
PSA.49.8	the ransom for a life is costly,
PSA.49.8	no payment is ever enough—
PSA.49.9	so that they should live on forever
PSA.49.9	and not see decay.
PSA.49.10	For all can see that the wise die,
PSA.49.10	that the foolish and the senseless also perish,
PSA.49.10	leaving their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their tombs will remain their houses
PSA.49.11	their dwellings for endless generations,
PSA.49.11	though they had
PSA.49.12	People, despite their wealth, do not endure;
PSA.49.12	they are like the beasts that perish.
PSA.49.13	This is the fate of those who trust in themselves,
PSA.49.13	and of their followers, who approve their sayings.
PSA.49.14	They are like sheep and are destined to die;
PSA.49.14	death will be their shepherd
PSA.49.14	(but the upright will prevail over them in the morning).
PSA.49.14	Their forms will decay in the grave,
PSA.49.14	far from their princely mansions.
PSA.49.15	But God will redeem me from the realm of the dead;
PSA.49.15	he will surely take me to himself.
PSA.49.16	Do not be overawed when others grow rich,
PSA.49.16	when the splendor of their houses increases;
PSA.49.17	for they will take nothing with them when they die,
PSA.49.17	their splendor will not descend with them.
PSA.49.18	Though while they live they count themselves blessed—
PSA.49.18	and people praise you when you prosper—
PSA.49.19	they will join those who have gone before them,
PSA.49.19	who will never again see the light of life.
PSA.49.20	People who have wealth but lack understanding
PSA.49.20	are like the beasts that perish.
PSA.50.1	The Mighty One, God, the 
PSA.50.1	speaks and summons the earth
PSA.50.1	from the rising of the sun to where it sets.
PSA.50.2	From Zion, perfect in beauty,
PSA.50.2	God shines forth.
PSA.50.3	Our God comes
PSA.50.3	and will not be silent;
PSA.50.3	a fire devours before him,
PSA.50.3	and around him a tempest rages.
PSA.50.4	He summons the heavens above,
PSA.50.4	and the earth, that he may judge his people:
PSA.50.5	“Gather to me this consecrated people,
PSA.50.5	who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”
PSA.50.6	And the heavens proclaim his righteousness,
PSA.50.6	for he is a God of justice.
PSA.50.7	“Listen, my people, and I will speak;
PSA.50.7	I will testify against you, Israel:
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God.
PSA.50.8	I bring no charges against you concerning your sacrifices
PSA.50.8	or concerning your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.
PSA.50.9	I have no need of a bull from your stall
PSA.50.9	or of goats from your pens,
PSA.50.10	for every animal of the forest is mine,
PSA.50.10	and the cattle on a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know every bird in the mountains,
PSA.50.11	and the insects in the fields are mine.
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry I would not tell you,
PSA.50.12	for the world is mine, and all that is in it.
PSA.50.13	Do I eat the flesh of bulls
PSA.50.13	or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	“Sacrifice thank offerings to God,
PSA.50.14	fulfill your vows to the Most High,
PSA.50.15	and call on me in the day of trouble;
PSA.50.15	I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”
PSA.50.16	But to the wicked person, God says:
PSA.50.16	“What right have you to recite my laws
PSA.50.16	or take my covenant on your lips?
PSA.50.17	You hate my instruction
PSA.50.17	and cast my words behind you.
PSA.50.18	When you see a thief, you join with him;
PSA.50.18	you throw in your lot with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	You use your mouth for evil
PSA.50.19	and harness your tongue to deceit.
PSA.50.20	You sit and testify against your brother
PSA.50.20	and slander your own mother’s son.
PSA.50.21	When you did these things and I kept silent,
PSA.50.21	you thought I was exactly
PSA.50.21	But I now arraign you
PSA.50.21	and set my accusations before you.
PSA.50.22	“Consider this, you who forget God,
PSA.50.22	or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:
PSA.50.23	Those who sacrifice thank offerings honor me,
PSA.50.23	and to the blameless
PSA.51.1	Have mercy on me, O God,
PSA.51.1	according to your unfailing love;
PSA.51.1	according to your great compassion
PSA.51.1	blot out my transgressions.
PSA.51.2	Wash away all my iniquity
PSA.51.2	and cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I know my transgressions,
PSA.51.3	and my sin is always before me.
PSA.51.4	Against you, you only, have I sinned
PSA.51.4	and done what is evil in your sight;
PSA.51.4	so you are right in your verdict
PSA.51.4	and justified when you judge.
PSA.51.5	Surely I was sinful at birth,
PSA.51.5	sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
PSA.51.6	Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb;
PSA.51.6	you taught me wisdom in that secret place.
PSA.51.7	Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean;
PSA.51.7	wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Let me hear joy and gladness;
PSA.51.8	let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
PSA.51.9	Hide your face from my sins
PSA.51.9	and blot out all my iniquity.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a pure heart, O God,
PSA.51.10	and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
PSA.51.11	Do not cast me from your presence
PSA.51.11	or take your Holy Spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	Restore to me the joy of your salvation
PSA.51.12	and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.
PSA.51.13	Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
PSA.51.13	so that sinners will turn back to you.
PSA.51.14	Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God,
PSA.51.14	you who are God my Savior,
PSA.51.14	and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
PSA.51.15	Open my lips, Lord,
PSA.51.15	and my mouth will declare your praise.
PSA.51.16	You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it;
PSA.51.16	you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
PSA.51.17	My sacrifice, O God, is
PSA.51.17	a broken and contrite heart
PSA.51.17	you, God, will not despise.
PSA.51.18	May it please you to prosper Zion,
PSA.51.18	to build up the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then you will delight in the sacrifices of the righteous,
PSA.51.19	in burnt offerings offered whole;
PSA.51.19	then bulls will be offered on your altar.
PSA.52.1	Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero?
PSA.52.1	Why do you boast all day long,
PSA.52.1	you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?
PSA.52.2	You who practice deceit,
PSA.52.2	your tongue plots destruction;
PSA.52.2	it is like a sharpened razor.
PSA.52.3	You love evil rather than good,
PSA.52.3	falsehood rather than speaking the truth.
PSA.52.4	You love every harmful word,
PSA.52.4	you deceitful tongue!
PSA.52.5	Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin:
PSA.52.5	He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent;
PSA.52.5	he will uproot you from the land of the living.
PSA.52.6	The righteous will see and fear;
PSA.52.6	they will laugh at you, saying,
PSA.52.7	“Here now is the man
PSA.52.7	who did not make God his stronghold
PSA.52.7	but trusted in his great wealth
PSA.52.7	and grew strong by destroying others!”
PSA.52.8	But I am like an olive tree
PSA.52.8	flourishing in the house of God;
PSA.52.8	I trust in God’s unfailing love
PSA.52.8	for ever and ever.
PSA.52.9	For what you have done I will always praise you
PSA.52.9	in the presence of your faithful people.
PSA.52.9	And I will hope in your name,
PSA.52.9	for your name is good.
PSA.53.1	The fool says in his heart,
PSA.53.1	“There is no God.”
PSA.53.1	They are corrupt, and their ways are vile;
PSA.53.1	there is no one who does good.
PSA.53.2	God looks down from heaven
PSA.53.2	on all mankind
PSA.53.2	to see if there are any who understand,
PSA.53.2	any who seek God.
PSA.53.3	Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt;
PSA.53.3	there is no one who does good,
PSA.53.3	not even one.
PSA.53.4	Do all these evildoers know nothing?
PSA.53.4	They devour my people as though eating bread;
PSA.53.4	they never call on God.
PSA.53.5	But there they are, overwhelmed with dread,
PSA.53.5	where there was nothing to dread.
PSA.53.5	God scattered the bones of those who attacked you;
PSA.53.5	you put them to shame, for God despised them.
PSA.53.6	Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!
PSA.53.6	When God restores his people,
PSA.53.6	let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God, by your name;
PSA.54.1	vindicate me by your might.
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God;
PSA.54.2	listen to the words of my mouth.
PSA.54.3	Arrogant foes are attacking me;
PSA.54.3	ruthless people are trying to kill me—
PSA.54.3	people without regard for God.
PSA.54.4	Surely God is my help;
PSA.54.4	the Lord is the one who sustains me.
PSA.54.5	Let evil recoil on those who slander me;
PSA.54.5	in your faithfulness destroy them.
PSA.54.6	I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you;
PSA.54.6	I will praise your name, 
PSA.54.7	You have delivered me from all my troubles,
PSA.54.7	and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.
PSA.55.1	Listen to my prayer, O God,
PSA.55.1	do not ignore my plea;
PSA.55.2	hear me and answer me.
PSA.55.2	My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught
PSA.55.3	because of what my enemy is saying,
PSA.55.3	because of the threats of the wicked;
PSA.55.3	for they bring down suffering on me
PSA.55.3	and assail me in their anger.
PSA.55.4	My heart is in anguish within me;
PSA.55.4	the terrors of death have fallen on me.
PSA.55.5	Fear and trembling have beset me;
PSA.55.5	horror has overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	I said, “Oh, that I had the wings of a dove!
PSA.55.6	I would fly away and be at rest.
PSA.55.7	I would flee far away
PSA.55.7	and stay in the desert;
PSA.55.8	I would hurry to my place of shelter,
PSA.55.8	far from the tempest and storm.”
PSA.55.9	Lord, confuse the wicked, confound their words,
PSA.55.9	for I see violence and strife in the city.
PSA.55.10	Day and night they prowl about on its walls;
PSA.55.10	malice and abuse are within it.
PSA.55.11	Destructive forces are at work in the city;
PSA.55.11	threats and lies never leave its streets.
PSA.55.12	If an enemy were insulting me,
PSA.55.12	I could endure it;
PSA.55.12	if a foe were rising against me,
PSA.55.12	I could hide.
PSA.55.13	But it is you, a man like myself,
PSA.55.13	my companion, my close friend,
PSA.55.14	with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship
PSA.55.14	at the house of God,
PSA.55.14	as we walked about
PSA.55.14	among the worshipers.
PSA.55.15	Let death take my enemies by surprise;
PSA.55.15	let them go down alive to the realm of the dead,
PSA.55.15	for evil finds lodging among them.
PSA.55.16	As for me, I call to God,
PSA.55.16	and the 
PSA.55.17	Evening, morning and noon
PSA.55.17	I cry out in distress,
PSA.55.17	and he hears my voice.
PSA.55.18	He rescues me unharmed
PSA.55.18	from the battle waged against me,
PSA.55.18	even though many oppose me.
PSA.55.19	God, who is enthroned from of old,
PSA.55.19	who does not change—
PSA.55.19	he will hear them and humble them,
PSA.55.19	because they have no fear of God.
PSA.55.20	My companion attacks his friends;
PSA.55.20	he violates his covenant.
PSA.55.21	His talk is smooth as butter,
PSA.55.21	yet war is in his heart;
PSA.55.21	his words are more soothing than oil,
PSA.55.21	yet they are drawn swords.
PSA.55.22	Cast your cares on the 
PSA.55.22	and he will sustain you;
PSA.55.22	he will never let
PSA.55.22	the righteous be shaken.
PSA.55.23	But you, God, will bring down the wicked
PSA.55.23	into the pit of decay;
PSA.55.23	the bloodthirsty and deceitful
PSA.55.23	will not live out half their days.
PSA.55.23	But as for me, I trust in you.
PSA.56.1	Be merciful to me, my God,
PSA.56.1	for my enemies are in hot pursuit;
PSA.56.1	all day long they press their attack.
PSA.56.2	My adversaries pursue me all day long;
PSA.56.2	in their pride many are attacking me.
PSA.56.3	When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
PSA.56.4	In God, whose word I praise—
PSA.56.4	in God I trust and am not afraid.
PSA.56.4	What can mere mortals do to me?
PSA.56.5	All day long they twist my words;
PSA.56.5	all their schemes are for my ruin.
PSA.56.6	They conspire, they lurk,
PSA.56.6	they watch my steps,
PSA.56.6	hoping to take my life.
PSA.56.7	Because of their wickedness do not
PSA.56.7	in your anger, God, bring the nations down.
PSA.56.8	Record my misery;
PSA.56.8	list my tears on your scroll
PSA.56.8	are they not in your record?
PSA.56.9	Then my enemies will turn back
PSA.56.9	when I call for help.
PSA.56.9	By this I will know that God is for me.
PSA.56.10	In God, whose word I praise,
PSA.56.10	in the 
PSA.56.11	in God I trust and am not afraid.
PSA.56.11	What can man do to me?
PSA.56.12	I am under vows to you, my God;
PSA.56.12	I will present my thank offerings to you.
PSA.56.13	For you have delivered me from death
PSA.56.13	and my feet from stumbling,
PSA.56.13	that I may walk before God
PSA.56.13	in the light of life.
PSA.57.1	Have mercy on me, my God, have mercy on me,
PSA.57.1	for in you I take refuge.
PSA.57.1	I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings
PSA.57.1	until the disaster has passed.
PSA.57.2	I cry out to God Most High,
PSA.57.2	to God, who vindicates me.
PSA.57.3	He sends from heaven and saves me,
PSA.57.3	rebuking those who hotly pursue me—
PSA.57.3	God sends forth his love and his faithfulness.
PSA.57.4	I am in the midst of lions;
PSA.57.4	I am forced to dwell among ravenous beasts—
PSA.57.4	men whose teeth are spears and arrows,
PSA.57.4	whose tongues are sharp swords.
PSA.57.5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
PSA.57.5	let your glory be over all the earth.
PSA.57.6	They spread a net for my feet—
PSA.57.6	I was bowed down in distress.
PSA.57.6	They dug a pit in my path—
PSA.57.6	but they have fallen into it themselves.
PSA.57.7	My heart, O God, is steadfast,
PSA.57.7	my heart is steadfast;
PSA.57.7	I will sing and make music.
PSA.57.8	Awake, my soul!
PSA.57.8	Awake, harp and lyre!
PSA.57.8	I will awaken the dawn.
PSA.57.9	I will praise you, Lord, among the nations;
PSA.57.9	I will sing of you among the peoples.
PSA.57.10	For great is your love, reaching to the heavens;
PSA.57.10	your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
PSA.57.11	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
PSA.57.11	let your glory be over all the earth.
PSA.58.1	Do you rulers indeed speak justly?
PSA.58.1	Do you judge people with equity?
PSA.58.2	No, in your heart you devise injustice,
PSA.58.2	and your hands mete out violence on the earth.
PSA.58.3	Even from birth the wicked go astray;
PSA.58.3	from the womb they are wayward, spreading lies.
PSA.58.4	Their venom is like the venom of a snake,
PSA.58.4	like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,
PSA.58.5	that will not heed the tune of the charmer,
PSA.58.5	however skillful the enchanter may be.
PSA.58.6	Break the teeth in their mouths, O God;
PSA.58.7	Let them vanish like water that flows away;
PSA.58.7	when they draw the bow, let their arrows fall short.
PSA.58.8	May they be like a slug that melts away as it moves along,
PSA.58.8	like a stillborn child that never sees the sun.
PSA.58.9	Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns—
PSA.58.9	whether they be green or dry—the wicked will be swept away.
PSA.58.10	The righteous will be glad when they are avenged,
PSA.58.10	when they dip their feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	Then people will say,
PSA.58.11	“Surely the righteous still are rewarded;
PSA.58.11	surely there is a God who judges the earth.”
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from my enemies, O God;
PSA.59.1	be my fortress against those who are attacking me.
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from evildoers
PSA.59.2	and save me from those who are after my blood.
PSA.59.3	See how they lie in wait for me!
PSA.59.3	Fierce men conspire against me
PSA.59.3	for no offense or sin of mine, 
PSA.59.4	I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.
PSA.59.4	Arise to help me; look on my plight!
PSA.59.5	You, 
PSA.59.5	you who are the God of Israel,
PSA.59.5	rouse yourself to punish all the nations;
PSA.59.5	show no mercy to wicked traitors.
PSA.59.6	They return at evening,
PSA.59.6	snarling like dogs,
PSA.59.6	and prowl about the city.
PSA.59.7	See what they spew from their mouths—
PSA.59.7	the words from their lips are sharp as swords,
PSA.59.7	and they think, “Who can hear us?”
PSA.59.8	But you laugh at them, 
PSA.59.8	you scoff at all those nations.
PSA.59.9	You are my strength, I watch for you;
PSA.59.9	you, God, are my fortress,
PSA.59.10	my God on whom I can rely.
PSA.59.10	God will go before me
PSA.59.10	and will let me gloat over those who slander me.
PSA.59.11	But do not kill them, Lord our shield,
PSA.59.11	or my people will forget.
PSA.59.11	In your might uproot them
PSA.59.11	and bring them down.
PSA.59.12	For the sins of their mouths,
PSA.59.12	for the words of their lips,
PSA.59.12	let them be caught in their pride.
PSA.59.12	For the curses and lies they utter,
PSA.59.13	consume them in your wrath,
PSA.59.13	consume them till they are no more.
PSA.59.13	Then it will be known to the ends of the earth
PSA.59.13	that God rules over Jacob.
PSA.59.14	They return at evening,
PSA.59.14	snarling like dogs,
PSA.59.14	and prowl about the city.
PSA.59.15	They wander about for food
PSA.59.15	and howl if not satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing of your strength,
PSA.59.16	in the morning I will sing of your love;
PSA.59.16	for you are my fortress,
PSA.59.16	my refuge in times of trouble.
PSA.59.17	You are my strength, I sing praise to you;
PSA.59.17	you, God, are my fortress,
PSA.59.17	my God on whom I can rely.
PSA.60.1	You have rejected us, God, and burst upon us;
PSA.60.1	you have been angry—now restore us!
PSA.60.2	You have shaken the land and torn it open;
PSA.60.2	mend its fractures, for it is quaking.
PSA.60.3	You have shown your people desperate times;
PSA.60.3	you have given us wine that makes us stagger.
PSA.60.4	But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner
PSA.60.4	to be unfurled against the bow.
PSA.60.5	Save us and help us with your right hand,
PSA.60.5	that those you love may be delivered.
PSA.60.6	God has spoken from his sanctuary:
PSA.60.6	“In triumph I will parcel out Shechem
PSA.60.6	and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth.
PSA.60.7	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
PSA.60.7	Ephraim is my helmet,
PSA.60.7	Judah is my scepter.
PSA.60.8	Moab is my washbasin,
PSA.60.8	on Edom I toss my sandal;
PSA.60.8	over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me to the fortified city?
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	Is it not you, God, you who have now rejected us
PSA.60.10	and no longer go out with our armies?
PSA.60.11	Give us aid against the enemy,
PSA.60.11	for human help is worthless.
PSA.60.12	With God we will gain the victory,
PSA.60.12	and he will trample down our enemies.
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God;
PSA.61.1	listen to my prayer.
PSA.61.2	From the ends of the earth I call to you,
PSA.61.2	I call as my heart grows faint;
PSA.61.2	lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
PSA.61.3	For you have been my refuge,
PSA.61.3	a strong tower against the foe.
PSA.61.4	I long to dwell in your tent forever
PSA.61.4	and take refuge in the shelter of your wings.
PSA.61.5	For you, God, have heard my vows;
PSA.61.5	you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
PSA.61.6	Increase the days of the king’s life,
PSA.61.6	his years for many generations.
PSA.61.7	May he be enthroned in God’s presence forever;
PSA.61.7	appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him.
PSA.61.8	Then I will ever sing in praise of your name
PSA.61.8	and fulfill my vows day after day.
PSA.62.1	Truly my soul finds rest in God;
PSA.62.1	my salvation comes from him.
PSA.62.2	Truly he is my rock and my salvation;
PSA.62.2	he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.
PSA.62.3	How long will you assault me?
PSA.62.3	Would all of you throw me down—
PSA.62.3	this leaning wall, this tottering fence?
PSA.62.4	Surely they intend to topple me
PSA.62.4	from my lofty place;
PSA.62.4	they take delight in lies.
PSA.62.4	With their mouths they bless,
PSA.62.4	but in their hearts they curse.
PSA.62.5	Yes, my soul, find rest in God;
PSA.62.5	my hope comes from him.
PSA.62.6	Truly he is my rock and my salvation;
PSA.62.6	he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.
PSA.62.7	My salvation and my honor depend on God
PSA.62.7	he is my mighty rock, my refuge.
PSA.62.8	Trust in him at all times, you people;
PSA.62.8	pour out your hearts to him,
PSA.62.8	for God is our refuge.
PSA.62.9	Surely the lowborn are but a breath,
PSA.62.9	the highborn are but a lie.
PSA.62.9	If weighed on a balance, they are nothing;
PSA.62.9	together they are only a breath.
PSA.62.10	Do not trust in extortion
PSA.62.10	or put vain hope in stolen goods;
PSA.62.10	though your riches increase,
PSA.62.10	do not set your heart on them.
PSA.62.11	One thing God has spoken,
PSA.62.11	two things I have heard:
PSA.62.11	“Power belongs to you, God,
PSA.62.12	and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”;
PSA.62.12	and, “You reward everyone
PSA.62.12	according to what they have done.”
PSA.63.1	You, God, are my God,
PSA.63.1	earnestly I seek you;
PSA.63.1	I thirst for you,
PSA.63.1	my whole being longs for you,
PSA.63.1	in a dry and parched land
PSA.63.1	where there is no water.
PSA.63.2	I have seen you in the sanctuary
PSA.63.2	and beheld your power and your glory.
PSA.63.3	Because your love is better than life,
PSA.63.3	my lips will glorify you.
PSA.63.4	I will praise you as long as I live,
PSA.63.4	and in your name I will lift up my hands.
PSA.63.5	I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods;
PSA.63.5	with singing lips my mouth will praise you.
PSA.63.6	On my bed I remember you;
PSA.63.6	I think of you through the watches of the night.
PSA.63.7	Because you are my help,
PSA.63.7	I sing in the shadow of your wings.
PSA.63.8	I cling to you;
PSA.63.8	your right hand upholds me.
PSA.63.9	Those who want to kill me will be destroyed;
PSA.63.9	they will go down to the depths of the earth.
PSA.63.10	They will be given over to the sword
PSA.63.10	and become food for jackals.
PSA.63.11	But the king will rejoice in God;
PSA.63.11	all who swear by God will glory in him,
PSA.63.11	while the mouths of liars will be silenced.
PSA.64.1	Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint;
PSA.64.1	protect my life from the threat of the enemy.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked,
PSA.64.2	from the plots of evildoers.
PSA.64.3	They sharpen their tongues like swords
PSA.64.3	and aim cruel words like deadly arrows.
PSA.64.4	They shoot from ambush at the innocent;
PSA.64.4	they shoot suddenly, without fear.
PSA.64.5	They encourage each other in evil plans,
PSA.64.5	they talk about hiding their snares;
PSA.64.5	they say, “Who will see it
PSA.64.6	They plot injustice and say,
PSA.64.6	“We have devised a perfect plan!”
PSA.64.6	Surely the human mind and heart are cunning.
PSA.64.7	But God will shoot them with his arrows;
PSA.64.7	they will suddenly be struck down.
PSA.64.8	He will turn their own tongues against them
PSA.64.8	and bring them to ruin;
PSA.64.8	all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.
PSA.64.9	All people will fear;
PSA.64.9	they will proclaim the works of God
PSA.64.9	and ponder what he has done.
PSA.64.10	The righteous will rejoice in the 
PSA.64.10	and take refuge in him;
PSA.64.10	all the upright in heart will glory in him!
PSA.65.1	Praise awaits
PSA.65.1	to you our vows will be fulfilled.
PSA.65.2	You who answer prayer,
PSA.65.2	to you all people will come.
PSA.65.3	When we were overwhelmed by sins,
PSA.65.3	you forgave
PSA.65.4	Blessed are those you choose
PSA.65.4	and bring near to live in your courts!
PSA.65.4	We are filled with the good things of your house,
PSA.65.4	of your holy temple.
PSA.65.5	You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds,
PSA.65.5	God our Savior,
PSA.65.5	the hope of all the ends of the earth
PSA.65.5	and of the farthest seas,
PSA.65.6	who formed the mountains by your power,
PSA.65.6	having armed yourself with strength,
PSA.65.7	who stilled the roaring of the seas,
PSA.65.7	the roaring of their waves,
PSA.65.7	and the turmoil of the nations.
PSA.65.8	The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders;
PSA.65.8	where morning dawns, where evening fades,
PSA.65.8	you call forth songs of joy.
PSA.65.9	You care for the land and water it;
PSA.65.9	you enrich it abundantly.
PSA.65.9	The streams of God are filled with water
PSA.65.9	to provide the people with grain,
PSA.65.9	for so you have ordained it.
PSA.65.10	You drench its furrows and level its ridges;
PSA.65.10	you soften it with showers and bless its crops.
PSA.65.11	You crown the year with your bounty,
PSA.65.11	and your carts overflow with abundance.
PSA.65.12	The grasslands of the wilderness overflow;
PSA.65.12	the hills are clothed with gladness.
PSA.65.13	The meadows are covered with flocks
PSA.65.13	and the valleys are mantled with grain;
PSA.65.13	they shout for joy and sing.
PSA.66.1	Shout for joy to God, all the earth!
PSA.66.2	Sing the glory of his name;
PSA.66.2	make his praise glorious.
PSA.66.3	Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds!
PSA.66.3	So great is your power
PSA.66.3	that your enemies cringe before you.
PSA.66.4	All the earth bows down to you;
PSA.66.4	they sing praise to you,
PSA.66.4	they sing the praises of your name.”
PSA.66.5	Come and see what God has done,
PSA.66.5	his awesome deeds for mankind!
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land,
PSA.66.6	they passed through the waters on foot—
PSA.66.6	come, let us rejoice in him.
PSA.66.7	He rules forever by his power,
PSA.66.7	his eyes watch the nations—
PSA.66.7	let not the rebellious rise up against him.
PSA.66.8	Praise our God, all peoples,
PSA.66.8	let the sound of his praise be heard;
PSA.66.9	he has preserved our lives
PSA.66.9	and kept our feet from slipping.
PSA.66.10	For you, God, tested us;
PSA.66.10	you refined us like silver.
PSA.66.11	You brought us into prison
PSA.66.11	and laid burdens on our backs.
PSA.66.12	You let people ride over our heads;
PSA.66.12	we went through fire and water,
PSA.66.12	but you brought us to a place of abundance.
PSA.66.13	I will come to your temple with burnt offerings
PSA.66.13	and fulfill my vows to you—
PSA.66.14	vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke
PSA.66.14	when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	I will sacrifice fat animals to you
PSA.66.15	and an offering of rams;
PSA.66.15	I will offer bulls and goats.
PSA.66.16	Come and hear, all you who fear God;
PSA.66.16	let me tell you what he has done for me.
PSA.66.17	I cried out to him with my mouth;
PSA.66.17	his praise was on my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I had cherished sin in my heart,
PSA.66.18	the Lord would not have listened;
PSA.66.19	but God has surely listened
PSA.66.19	and has heard my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Praise be to God,
PSA.66.20	who has not rejected my prayer
PSA.66.20	or withheld his love from me!
PSA.67.1	May God be gracious to us and bless us
PSA.67.1	and make his face shine on us—
PSA.67.2	so that your ways may be known on earth,
PSA.67.2	your salvation among all nations.
PSA.67.3	May the peoples praise you, God;
PSA.67.3	may all the peoples praise you.
PSA.67.4	May the nations be glad and sing for joy,
PSA.67.4	for you rule the peoples with equity
PSA.67.4	and guide the nations of the earth.
PSA.67.5	May the peoples praise you, God;
PSA.67.5	may all the peoples praise you.
PSA.67.6	The land yields its harvest;
PSA.67.6	God, our God, blesses us.
PSA.67.7	May God bless us still,
PSA.67.7	so that all the ends of the earth will fear him.
PSA.68.1	May God arise, may his enemies be scattered;
PSA.68.1	may his foes flee before him.
PSA.68.2	May you blow them away like smoke—
PSA.68.2	as wax melts before the fire,
PSA.68.2	may the wicked perish before God.
PSA.68.3	But may the righteous be glad
PSA.68.3	and rejoice before God;
PSA.68.3	may they be happy and joyful.
PSA.68.4	Sing to God, sing in praise of his name,
PSA.68.4	extol him who rides on the clouds
PSA.68.4	rejoice before him—his name is the 
PSA.68.5	A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows,
PSA.68.5	is God in his holy dwelling.
PSA.68.6	God sets the lonely in families,
PSA.68.6	he leads out the prisoners with singing;
PSA.68.6	but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.
PSA.68.7	When you, God, went out before your people,
PSA.68.7	when you marched through the wilderness,
PSA.68.8	the earth shook, the heavens poured down rain,
PSA.68.8	before God, the One of Sinai,
PSA.68.8	before God, the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	You gave abundant showers, O God;
PSA.68.9	you refreshed your weary inheritance.
PSA.68.10	Your people settled in it,
PSA.68.10	and from your bounty, God, you provided for the poor.
PSA.68.11	The Lord announces the word,
PSA.68.11	and the women who proclaim it are a mighty throng:
PSA.68.12	“Kings and armies flee in haste;
PSA.68.12	the women at home divide the plunder.
PSA.68.13	Even while you sleep among the sheep pens,
PSA.68.13	the wings of my dove are sheathed with silver,
PSA.68.13	its feathers with shining gold.”
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty
PSA.68.14	it was like snow fallen on Mount Zalmon.
PSA.68.15	Mount Bashan, majestic mountain,
PSA.68.15	Mount Bashan, rugged mountain,
PSA.68.16	why gaze in envy, you rugged mountain,
PSA.68.16	at the mountain where God chooses to reign,
PSA.68.16	where the 
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God are tens of thousands
PSA.68.17	and thousands of thousands;
PSA.68.17	the Lord has come from Sinai into his sanctuary.
PSA.68.18	When you ascended on high,
PSA.68.18	you took many captives;
PSA.68.18	you received gifts from people,
PSA.68.18	even from
PSA.68.18	that you,
PSA.68.19	Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior,
PSA.68.19	who daily bears our burdens.
PSA.68.20	Our God is a God who saves;
PSA.68.20	from the Sovereign 
PSA.68.21	Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies,
PSA.68.21	the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins.
PSA.68.22	The Lord says, “I will bring them from Bashan;
PSA.68.22	I will bring them from the depths of the sea,
PSA.68.23	that your feet may wade in the blood of your foes,
PSA.68.23	while the tongues of your dogs have their share.”
PSA.68.24	Your procession, God, has come into view,
PSA.68.24	the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	In front are the singers, after them the musicians;
PSA.68.25	with them are the young women playing the timbrels.
PSA.68.26	Praise God in the great congregation;
PSA.68.26	praise the 
PSA.68.27	There is the little tribe of Benjamin, leading them,
PSA.68.27	there the great throng of Judah’s princes,
PSA.68.27	and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Summon your power, God
PSA.68.28	show us your strength, our God, as you have done before.
PSA.68.29	Because of your temple at Jerusalem
PSA.68.29	kings will bring you gifts.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the beast among the reeds,
PSA.68.30	the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations.
PSA.68.30	Humbled, may the beast bring bars of silver.
PSA.68.30	Scatter the nations who delight in war.
PSA.68.31	Envoys will come from Egypt;
PSA.68.31	Cush
PSA.68.32	Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth,
PSA.68.32	sing praise to the Lord,
PSA.68.33	to him who rides across the highest heavens, the ancient heavens,
PSA.68.33	who thunders with mighty voice.
PSA.68.34	Proclaim the power of God,
PSA.68.34	whose majesty is over Israel,
PSA.68.34	whose power is in the heavens.
PSA.68.35	You, God, are awesome in your sanctuary;
PSA.68.35	the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people.
PSA.68.35	Praise be to God!
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God,
PSA.69.1	for the waters have come up to my neck.
PSA.69.2	I sink in the miry depths,
PSA.69.2	where there is no foothold.
PSA.69.2	I have come into the deep waters;
PSA.69.2	the floods engulf me.
PSA.69.3	I am worn out calling for help;
PSA.69.3	my throat is parched.
PSA.69.3	My eyes fail,
PSA.69.3	looking for my God.
PSA.69.4	Those who hate me without reason
PSA.69.4	outnumber the hairs of my head;
PSA.69.4	many are my enemies without cause,
PSA.69.4	those who seek to destroy me.
PSA.69.4	I am forced to restore
PSA.69.4	what I did not steal.
PSA.69.5	You, God, know my folly;
PSA.69.5	my guilt is not hidden from you.
PSA.69.6	Lord, the 
PSA.69.6	may those who hope in you
PSA.69.6	not be disgraced because of me;
PSA.69.6	God of Israel,
PSA.69.6	may those who seek you
PSA.69.6	not be put to shame because of me.
PSA.69.7	For I endure scorn for your sake,
PSA.69.7	and shame covers my face.
PSA.69.8	I am a foreigner to my own family,
PSA.69.8	a stranger to my own mother’s children;
PSA.69.9	for zeal for your house consumes me,
PSA.69.9	and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.
PSA.69.10	When I weep and fast,
PSA.69.10	I must endure scorn;
PSA.69.11	when I put on sackcloth,
PSA.69.11	people make sport of me.
PSA.69.12	Those who sit at the gate mock me,
PSA.69.12	and I am the song of the drunkards.
PSA.69.13	But I pray to you, 
PSA.69.13	in the time of your favor;
PSA.69.13	in your great love, O God,
PSA.69.13	answer me with your sure salvation.
PSA.69.14	Rescue me from the mire,
PSA.69.14	do not let me sink;
PSA.69.14	deliver me from those who hate me,
PSA.69.14	from the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Do not let the floodwaters engulf me
PSA.69.15	or the depths swallow me up
PSA.69.15	or the pit close its mouth over me.
PSA.69.16	Answer me, 
PSA.69.16	in your great mercy turn to me.
PSA.69.17	Do not hide your face from your servant;
PSA.69.17	answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.
PSA.69.18	Come near and rescue me;
PSA.69.18	deliver me because of my foes.
PSA.69.19	You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed;
PSA.69.19	all my enemies are before you.
PSA.69.20	Scorn has broken my heart
PSA.69.20	and has left me helpless;
PSA.69.20	I looked for sympathy, but there was none,
PSA.69.20	for comforters, but I found none.
PSA.69.21	They put gall in my food
PSA.69.21	and gave me vinegar for my thirst.
PSA.69.22	May the table set before them become a snare;
PSA.69.22	may it become retribution and
PSA.69.23	May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,
PSA.69.23	and their backs be bent forever.
PSA.69.24	Pour out your wrath on them;
PSA.69.24	let your fierce anger overtake them.
PSA.69.25	May their place be deserted;
PSA.69.25	let there be no one to dwell in their tents.
PSA.69.26	For they persecute those you wound
PSA.69.26	and talk about the pain of those you hurt.
PSA.69.27	Charge them with crime upon crime;
PSA.69.27	do not let them share in your salvation.
PSA.69.28	May they be blotted out of the book of life
PSA.69.28	and not be listed with the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But as for me, afflicted and in pain—
PSA.69.29	may your salvation, God, protect me.
PSA.69.30	I will praise God’s name in song
PSA.69.30	and glorify him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.31	This will please the 
PSA.69.31	more than a bull with its horns and hooves.
PSA.69.32	The poor will see and be glad—
PSA.69.32	you who seek God, may your hearts live!
PSA.69.33	The 
PSA.69.33	and does not despise his captive people.
PSA.69.34	Let heaven and earth praise him,
PSA.69.34	the seas and all that move in them,
PSA.69.35	for God will save Zion
PSA.69.35	and rebuild the cities of Judah.
PSA.69.35	Then people will settle there and possess it;
PSA.69.36	the children of his servants will inherit it,
PSA.69.36	and those who love his name will dwell there.
PSA.70.1	Hasten, O God, to save me;
PSA.70.1	come quickly, 
PSA.70.2	May those who want to take my life
PSA.70.2	be put to shame and confusion;
PSA.70.2	may all who desire my ruin
PSA.70.2	be turned back in disgrace.
PSA.70.3	May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”
PSA.70.3	turn back because of their shame.
PSA.70.4	But may all who seek you
PSA.70.4	rejoice and be glad in you;
PSA.70.4	may those who long for your saving help always say,
PSA.70.4	“The 
PSA.70.5	But as for me, I am poor and needy;
PSA.70.5	come quickly to me, O God.
PSA.70.5	You are my help and my deliverer;
PSA.71.1	In you, 
PSA.71.1	let me never be put to shame.
PSA.71.2	In your righteousness, rescue me and deliver me;
PSA.71.2	turn your ear to me and save me.
PSA.71.3	Be my rock of refuge,
PSA.71.3	to which I can always go;
PSA.71.3	give the command to save me,
PSA.71.3	for you are my rock and my fortress.
PSA.71.4	Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,
PSA.71.4	from the grasp of those who are evil and cruel.
PSA.71.5	For you have been my hope, Sovereign 
PSA.71.5	my confidence since my youth.
PSA.71.6	From birth I have relied on you;
PSA.71.6	you brought me forth from my mother’s womb.
PSA.71.6	I will ever praise you.
PSA.71.7	I have become a sign to many;
PSA.71.7	you are my strong refuge.
PSA.71.8	My mouth is filled with your praise,
PSA.71.8	declaring your splendor all day long.
PSA.71.9	Do not cast me away when I am old;
PSA.71.9	do not forsake me when my strength is gone.
PSA.71.10	For my enemies speak against me;
PSA.71.10	those who wait to kill me conspire together.
PSA.71.11	They say, “God has forsaken him;
PSA.71.11	pursue him and seize him,
PSA.71.11	for no one will rescue him.”
PSA.71.12	Do not be far from me, my God;
PSA.71.12	come quickly, God, to help me.
PSA.71.13	May my accusers perish in shame;
PSA.71.13	may those who want to harm me
PSA.71.13	be covered with scorn and disgrace.
PSA.71.14	As for me, I will always have hope;
PSA.71.14	I will praise you more and more.
PSA.71.15	My mouth will tell of your righteous deeds,
PSA.71.15	of your saving acts all day long—
PSA.71.15	though I know not how to relate them all.
PSA.71.16	I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, Sovereign 
PSA.71.16	I will proclaim your righteous deeds, yours alone.
PSA.71.17	Since my youth, God, you have taught me,
PSA.71.17	and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.
PSA.71.18	Even when I am old and gray,
PSA.71.18	do not forsake me, my God,
PSA.71.18	till I declare your power to the next generation,
PSA.71.18	your mighty acts to all who are to come.
PSA.71.19	Your righteousness, God, reaches to the heavens,
PSA.71.19	you who have done great things.
PSA.71.19	Who is like you, God?
PSA.71.20	Though you have made me see troubles,
PSA.71.20	many and bitter,
PSA.71.20	you will restore my life again;
PSA.71.20	from the depths of the earth
PSA.71.20	you will again bring me up.
PSA.71.21	You will increase my honor
PSA.71.21	and comfort me once more.
PSA.71.22	I will praise you with the harp
PSA.71.22	for your faithfulness, my God;
PSA.71.22	I will sing praise to you with the lyre,
PSA.71.22	Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	My lips will shout for joy
PSA.71.23	when I sing praise to you—
PSA.71.23	I whom you have delivered.
PSA.71.24	My tongue will tell of your righteous acts
PSA.71.24	all day long,
PSA.71.24	for those who wanted to harm me
PSA.71.24	have been put to shame and confusion.
PSA.72.1	Endow the king with your justice, O God,
PSA.72.1	the royal son with your righteousness.
PSA.72.2	May he judge your people in righteousness,
PSA.72.2	your afflicted ones with justice.
PSA.72.3	May the mountains bring prosperity to the people,
PSA.72.3	the hills the fruit of righteousness.
PSA.72.4	May he defend the afflicted among the people
PSA.72.4	and save the children of the needy;
PSA.72.4	may he crush the oppressor.
PSA.72.5	May he endure
PSA.72.5	as long as the moon, through all generations.
PSA.72.6	May he be like rain falling on a mown field,
PSA.72.6	like showers watering the earth.
PSA.72.7	In his days may the righteous flourish
PSA.72.7	and prosperity abound till the moon is no more.
PSA.72.8	May he rule from sea to sea
PSA.72.8	and from the River
PSA.72.9	May the desert tribes bow before him
PSA.72.9	and his enemies lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	May the kings of Tarshish and of distant shores
PSA.72.10	bring tribute to him.
PSA.72.10	May the kings of Sheba and Seba
PSA.72.10	present him gifts.
PSA.72.11	May all kings bow down to him
PSA.72.11	and all nations serve him.
PSA.72.12	For he will deliver the needy who cry out,
PSA.72.12	the afflicted who have no one to help.
PSA.72.13	He will take pity on the weak and the needy
PSA.72.13	and save the needy from death.
PSA.72.14	He will rescue them from oppression and violence,
PSA.72.14	for precious is their blood in his sight.
PSA.72.15	Long may he live!
PSA.72.15	May gold from Sheba be given him.
PSA.72.15	May people ever pray for him
PSA.72.15	and bless him all day long.
PSA.72.16	May grain abound throughout the land;
PSA.72.16	on the tops of the hills may it sway.
PSA.72.16	May the crops flourish like Lebanon
PSA.72.16	and thrive
PSA.72.17	May his name endure forever;
PSA.72.17	may it continue as long as the sun.
PSA.72.17	Then all nations will be blessed through him,
PSA.72.17	and they will call him blessed.
PSA.72.18	Praise be to the 
PSA.72.18	who alone does marvelous deeds.
PSA.72.19	Praise be to his glorious name forever;
PSA.72.19	may the whole earth be filled with his glory.
PSA.72.19	Amen and Amen.
PSA.72.20	This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.
PSA.73.1	Surely God is good to Israel,
PSA.73.1	to those who are pure in heart.
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet had almost slipped;
PSA.73.2	I had nearly lost my foothold.
PSA.73.3	For I envied the arrogant
PSA.73.3	when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
PSA.73.4	They have no struggles;
PSA.73.4	their bodies are healthy and strong.
PSA.73.5	They are free from common human burdens;
PSA.73.5	they are not plagued by human ills.
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride is their necklace;
PSA.73.6	they clothe themselves with violence.
PSA.73.7	From their callous hearts comes iniquity
PSA.73.7	their evil imaginations have no limits.
PSA.73.8	They scoff, and speak with malice;
PSA.73.8	with arrogance they threaten oppression.
PSA.73.9	Their mouths lay claim to heaven,
PSA.73.9	and their tongues take possession of the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore their people turn to them
PSA.73.10	and drink up waters in abundance.
PSA.73.11	They say, “How would God know?
PSA.73.11	Does the Most High know anything?”
PSA.73.12	This is what the wicked are like—
PSA.73.12	always free of care, they go on amassing wealth.
PSA.73.13	Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure
PSA.73.13	and have washed my hands in innocence.
PSA.73.14	All day long I have been afflicted,
PSA.73.14	and every morning brings new punishments.
PSA.73.15	If I had spoken out like that,
PSA.73.15	I would have betrayed your children.
PSA.73.16	When I tried to understand all this,
PSA.73.16	it troubled me deeply
PSA.73.17	till I entered the sanctuary of God;
PSA.73.17	then I understood their final destiny.
PSA.73.18	Surely you place them on slippery ground;
PSA.73.18	you cast them down to ruin.
PSA.73.19	How suddenly are they destroyed,
PSA.73.19	completely swept away by terrors!
PSA.73.20	They are like a dream when one awakes;
PSA.73.20	when you arise, Lord,
PSA.73.20	you will despise them as fantasies.
PSA.73.21	When my heart was grieved
PSA.73.21	and my spirit embittered,
PSA.73.22	I was senseless and ignorant;
PSA.73.22	I was a brute beast before you.
PSA.73.23	Yet I am always with you;
PSA.73.23	you hold me by my right hand.
PSA.73.24	You guide me with your counsel,
PSA.73.24	and afterward you will take me into glory.
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven but you?
PSA.73.25	And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart may fail,
PSA.73.26	but God is the strength of my heart
PSA.73.26	and my portion forever.
PSA.73.27	Those who are far from you will perish;
PSA.73.27	you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
PSA.73.28	But as for me, it is good to be near God.
PSA.73.28	I have made the Sovereign 
PSA.73.28	I will tell of all your deeds.
PSA.74.1	O God, why have you rejected us forever?
PSA.74.1	Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember the nation you purchased long ago,
PSA.74.2	the people of your inheritance, whom you redeemed—
PSA.74.2	Mount Zion, where you dwelt.
PSA.74.3	Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins,
PSA.74.3	all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	Your foes roared in the place where you met with us;
PSA.74.4	they set up their standards as signs.
PSA.74.5	They behaved like men wielding axes
PSA.74.5	to cut through a thicket of trees.
PSA.74.6	They smashed all the carved paneling
PSA.74.6	with their axes and hatchets.
PSA.74.7	They burned your sanctuary to the ground;
PSA.74.7	they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.
PSA.74.8	They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely!”
PSA.74.8	They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.
PSA.74.9	We are given no signs from God;
PSA.74.9	no prophets are left,
PSA.74.9	and none of us knows how long this will be.
PSA.74.10	How long will the enemy mock you, God?
PSA.74.10	Will the foe revile your name forever?
PSA.74.11	Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?
PSA.74.11	Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!
PSA.74.12	But God is my King from long ago;
PSA.74.12	he brings salvation on the earth.
PSA.74.13	It was you who split open the sea by your power;
PSA.74.13	you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.
PSA.74.14	It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan
PSA.74.14	and gave it as food to the creatures of the desert.
PSA.74.15	It was you who opened up springs and streams;
PSA.74.15	you dried up the ever-flowing rivers.
PSA.74.16	The day is yours, and yours also the night;
PSA.74.16	you established the sun and moon.
PSA.74.17	It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth;
PSA.74.17	you made both summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember how the enemy has mocked you, 
PSA.74.18	how foolish people have reviled your name.
PSA.74.19	Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts;
PSA.74.19	do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.
PSA.74.20	Have regard for your covenant,
PSA.74.20	because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.
PSA.74.21	Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace;
PSA.74.21	may the poor and needy praise your name.
PSA.74.22	Rise up, O God, and defend your cause;
PSA.74.22	remember how fools mock you all day long.
PSA.74.23	Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries,
PSA.74.23	the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually.
PSA.75.1	We praise you, God,
PSA.75.1	we praise you, for your Name is near;
PSA.75.1	people tell of your wonderful deeds.
PSA.75.2	You say, “I choose the appointed time;
PSA.75.2	it is I who judge with equity.
PSA.75.3	When the earth and all its people quake,
PSA.75.3	it is I who hold its pillars firm.
PSA.75.4	To the arrogant I say, ‘Boast no more,’
PSA.75.4	and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns.
PSA.75.5	Do not lift your horns against heaven;
PSA.75.5	do not speak so defiantly.’ ”
PSA.75.6	No one from the east or the west
PSA.75.6	or from the desert can exalt themselves.
PSA.75.7	It is God who judges:
PSA.75.7	He brings one down, he exalts another.
PSA.75.8	In the hand of the 
PSA.75.8	full of foaming wine mixed with spices;
PSA.75.8	he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth
PSA.75.8	drink it down to its very dregs.
PSA.75.9	As for me, I will declare this forever;
PSA.75.9	I will sing praise to the God of Jacob,
PSA.75.10	who says, “I will cut off the horns of all the wicked,
PSA.75.10	but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”
PSA.76.1	God is renowned in Judah;
PSA.76.1	in Israel his name is great.
PSA.76.2	His tent is in Salem,
PSA.76.2	his dwelling place in Zion.
PSA.76.3	There he broke the flashing arrows,
PSA.76.3	the shields and the swords, the weapons of war.
PSA.76.4	You are radiant with light,
PSA.76.4	more majestic than mountains rich with game.
PSA.76.5	The valiant lie plundered,
PSA.76.5	they sleep their last sleep;
PSA.76.5	not one of the warriors
PSA.76.5	can lift his hands.
PSA.76.6	At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	both horse and chariot lie still.
PSA.76.7	It is you alone who are to be feared.
PSA.76.7	Who can stand before you when you are angry?
PSA.76.8	From heaven you pronounced judgment,
PSA.76.8	and the land feared and was quiet—
PSA.76.9	when you, God, rose up to judge,
PSA.76.9	to save all the afflicted of the land.
PSA.76.10	Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise,
PSA.76.10	and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.
PSA.76.11	Make vows to the 
PSA.76.11	let all the neighboring lands
PSA.76.11	bring gifts to the One to be feared.
PSA.76.12	He breaks the spirit of rulers;
PSA.76.12	he is feared by the kings of the earth.
PSA.77.1	I cried out to God for help;
PSA.77.1	I cried out to God to hear me.
PSA.77.2	When I was in distress, I sought the Lord;
PSA.77.2	at night I stretched out untiring hands,
PSA.77.2	and I would not be comforted.
PSA.77.3	I remembered you, God, and I groaned;
PSA.77.3	I meditated, and my spirit grew faint.
PSA.77.4	You kept my eyes from closing;
PSA.77.4	I was too troubled to speak.
PSA.77.5	I thought about the former days,
PSA.77.5	the years of long ago;
PSA.77.6	I remembered my songs in the night.
PSA.77.6	My heart meditated and my spirit asked:
PSA.77.7	“Will the Lord reject forever?
PSA.77.7	Will he never show his favor again?
PSA.77.8	Has his unfailing love vanished forever?
PSA.77.8	Has his promise failed for all time?
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to be merciful?
PSA.77.9	Has he in anger withheld his compassion?”
PSA.77.10	Then I thought, “To this I will appeal:
PSA.77.10	the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand.
PSA.77.11	I will remember the deeds of the 
PSA.77.11	yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.
PSA.77.12	I will consider all your works
PSA.77.12	and meditate on all your mighty deeds.”
PSA.77.13	Your ways, God, are holy.
PSA.77.13	What god is as great as our God?
PSA.77.14	You are the God who performs miracles;
PSA.77.14	you display your power among the peoples.
PSA.77.15	With your mighty arm you redeemed your people,
PSA.77.15	the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
PSA.77.16	The waters saw you, God,
PSA.77.16	the waters saw you and writhed;
PSA.77.16	the very depths were convulsed.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured down water,
PSA.77.17	the heavens resounded with thunder;
PSA.77.17	your arrows flashed back and forth.
PSA.77.18	Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind,
PSA.77.18	your lightning lit up the world;
PSA.77.18	the earth trembled and quaked.
PSA.77.19	Your path led through the sea,
PSA.77.19	your way through the mighty waters,
PSA.77.19	though your footprints were not seen.
PSA.77.20	You led your people like a flock
PSA.77.20	by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	My people, hear my teaching;
PSA.78.1	listen to the words of my mouth.
PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth with a parable;
PSA.78.2	I will utter hidden things, things from of old—
PSA.78.3	things we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	things our ancestors have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their descendants;
PSA.78.4	we will tell the next generation
PSA.78.4	the praiseworthy deeds of the 
PSA.78.4	his power, and the wonders he has done.
PSA.78.5	He decreed statutes for Jacob
PSA.78.5	and established the law in Israel,
PSA.78.5	which he commanded our ancestors
PSA.78.5	to teach their children,
PSA.78.6	so the next generation would know them,
PSA.78.6	even the children yet to be born,
PSA.78.6	and they in turn would tell their children.
PSA.78.7	Then they would put their trust in God
PSA.78.7	and would not forget his deeds
PSA.78.7	but would keep his commands.
PSA.78.8	They would not be like their ancestors—
PSA.78.8	a stubborn and rebellious generation,
PSA.78.8	whose hearts were not loyal to God,
PSA.78.8	whose spirits were not faithful to him.
PSA.78.9	The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows,
PSA.78.9	turned back on the day of battle;
PSA.78.10	they did not keep God’s covenant
PSA.78.10	and refused to live by his law.
PSA.78.11	They forgot what he had done,
PSA.78.11	the wonders he had shown them.
PSA.78.12	He did miracles in the sight of their ancestors
PSA.78.12	in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
PSA.78.13	He divided the sea and led them through;
PSA.78.13	he made the water stand up like a wall.
PSA.78.14	He guided them with the cloud by day
PSA.78.14	and with light from the fire all night.
PSA.78.15	He split the rocks in the wilderness
PSA.78.15	and gave them water as abundant as the seas;
PSA.78.16	he brought streams out of a rocky crag
PSA.78.16	and made water flow down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	But they continued to sin against him,
PSA.78.17	rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High.
PSA.78.18	They willfully put God to the test
PSA.78.18	by demanding the food they craved.
PSA.78.19	They spoke against God;
PSA.78.19	they said, “Can God really
PSA.78.19	spread a table in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	True, he struck the rock,
PSA.78.20	and water gushed out,
PSA.78.20	streams flowed abundantly,
PSA.78.20	but can he also give us bread?
PSA.78.20	Can he supply meat for his people?”
PSA.78.21	When the 
PSA.78.21	his fire broke out against Jacob,
PSA.78.21	and his wrath rose against Israel,
PSA.78.22	for they did not believe in God
PSA.78.22	or trust in his deliverance.
PSA.78.23	Yet he gave a command to the skies above
PSA.78.23	and opened the doors of the heavens;
PSA.78.24	he rained down manna for the people to eat,
PSA.78.24	he gave them the grain of heaven.
PSA.78.25	Human beings ate the bread of angels;
PSA.78.25	he sent them all the food they could eat.
PSA.78.26	He let loose the east wind from the heavens
PSA.78.26	and by his power made the south wind blow.
PSA.78.27	He rained meat down on them like dust,
PSA.78.27	birds like sand on the seashore.
PSA.78.28	He made them come down inside their camp,
PSA.78.28	all around their tents.
PSA.78.29	They ate till they were gorged—
PSA.78.29	he had given them what they craved.
PSA.78.30	But before they turned from what they craved,
PSA.78.30	even while the food was still in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	God’s anger rose against them;
PSA.78.31	he put to death the sturdiest among them,
PSA.78.31	cutting down the young men of Israel.
PSA.78.32	In spite of all this, they kept on sinning;
PSA.78.32	in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.
PSA.78.33	So he ended their days in futility
PSA.78.33	and their years in terror.
PSA.78.34	Whenever God slew them, they would seek him;
PSA.78.34	they eagerly turned to him again.
PSA.78.35	They remembered that God was their Rock,
PSA.78.35	that God Most High was their Redeemer.
PSA.78.36	But then they would flatter him with their mouths,
PSA.78.36	lying to him with their tongues;
PSA.78.37	their hearts were not loyal to him,
PSA.78.37	they were not faithful to his covenant.
PSA.78.38	Yet he was merciful;
PSA.78.38	he forgave their iniquities
PSA.78.38	and did not destroy them.
PSA.78.38	Time after time he restrained his anger
PSA.78.38	and did not stir up his full wrath.
PSA.78.39	He remembered that they were but flesh,
PSA.78.39	a passing breeze that does not return.
PSA.78.40	How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
PSA.78.40	and grieved him in the wasteland!
PSA.78.41	Again and again they put God to the test;
PSA.78.41	they vexed the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They did not remember his power—
PSA.78.42	the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,
PSA.78.43	the day he displayed his signs in Egypt,
PSA.78.43	his wonders in the region of Zoan.
PSA.78.44	He turned their river into blood;
PSA.78.44	they could not drink from their streams.
PSA.78.45	He sent swarms of flies that devoured them,
PSA.78.45	and frogs that devastated them.
PSA.78.46	He gave their crops to the grasshopper,
PSA.78.46	their produce to the locust.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail
PSA.78.47	and their sycamore-figs with sleet.
PSA.78.48	He gave over their cattle to the hail,
PSA.78.48	their livestock to bolts of lightning.
PSA.78.49	He unleashed against them his hot anger,
PSA.78.49	his wrath, indignation and hostility—
PSA.78.49	a band of destroying angels.
PSA.78.50	He prepared a path for his anger;
PSA.78.50	he did not spare them from death
PSA.78.50	but gave them over to the plague.
PSA.78.51	He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt,
PSA.78.51	the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.
PSA.78.52	But he brought his people out like a flock;
PSA.78.52	he led them like sheep through the wilderness.
PSA.78.53	He guided them safely, so they were unafraid;
PSA.78.53	but the sea engulfed their enemies.
PSA.78.54	And so he brought them to the border of his holy land,
PSA.78.54	to the hill country his right hand had taken.
PSA.78.55	He drove out nations before them
PSA.78.55	and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance;
PSA.78.55	he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.
PSA.78.56	But they put God to the test
PSA.78.56	and rebelled against the Most High;
PSA.78.56	they did not keep his statutes.
PSA.78.57	Like their ancestors they were disloyal and faithless,
PSA.78.57	as unreliable as a faulty bow.
PSA.78.58	They angered him with their high places;
PSA.78.58	they aroused his jealousy with their idols.
PSA.78.59	When God heard them, he was furious;
PSA.78.59	he rejected Israel completely.
PSA.78.60	He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	the tent he had set up among humans.
PSA.78.61	He sent the ark of his might into captivity,
PSA.78.61	his splendor into the hands of the enemy.
PSA.78.62	He gave his people over to the sword;
PSA.78.62	he was furious with his inheritance.
PSA.78.63	Fire consumed their young men,
PSA.78.63	and their young women had no wedding songs;
PSA.78.64	their priests were put to the sword,
PSA.78.64	and their widows could not weep.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,
PSA.78.65	as a warrior wakes from the stupor of wine.
PSA.78.66	He beat back his enemies;
PSA.78.66	he put them to everlasting shame.
PSA.78.67	Then he rejected the tents of Joseph,
PSA.78.67	he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
PSA.78.68	but he chose the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	Mount Zion, which he loved.
PSA.78.69	He built his sanctuary like the heights,
PSA.78.69	like the earth that he established forever.
PSA.78.70	He chose David his servant
PSA.78.70	and took him from the sheep pens;
PSA.78.71	from tending the sheep he brought him
PSA.78.71	to be the shepherd of his people Jacob,
PSA.78.71	of Israel his inheritance.
PSA.78.72	And David shepherded them with integrity of heart;
PSA.78.72	with skillful hands he led them.
PSA.79.1	O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance;
PSA.79.1	they have defiled your holy temple,
PSA.79.1	they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.
PSA.79.2	They have left the dead bodies of your servants
PSA.79.2	as food for the birds of the sky,
PSA.79.2	the flesh of your own people for the animals of the wild.
PSA.79.3	They have poured out blood like water
PSA.79.3	all around Jerusalem,
PSA.79.3	and there is no one to bury the dead.
PSA.79.4	We are objects of contempt to our neighbors,
PSA.79.4	of scorn and derision to those around us.
PSA.79.5	How long, 
PSA.79.5	How long will your jealousy burn like fire?
PSA.79.6	Pour out your wrath on the nations
PSA.79.6	that do not acknowledge you,
PSA.79.6	on the kingdoms
PSA.79.6	that do not call on your name;
PSA.79.7	for they have devoured Jacob
PSA.79.7	and devastated his homeland.
PSA.79.8	Do not hold against us the sins of past generations;
PSA.79.8	may your mercy come quickly to meet us,
PSA.79.8	for we are in desperate need.
PSA.79.9	Help us, God our Savior,
PSA.79.9	for the glory of your name;
PSA.79.9	deliver us and forgive our sins
PSA.79.9	for your name’s sake.
PSA.79.10	Why should the nations say,
PSA.79.10	“Where is their God?”
PSA.79.10	Before our eyes, make known among the nations
PSA.79.10	that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.
PSA.79.11	May the groans of the prisoners come before you;
PSA.79.11	with your strong arm preserve those condemned to die.
PSA.79.12	Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times
PSA.79.12	the contempt they have hurled at you, Lord.
PSA.79.13	Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture,
PSA.79.13	will praise you forever;
PSA.79.13	from generation to generation
PSA.79.13	we will proclaim your praise.
PSA.80.1	Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,
PSA.80.1	you who lead Joseph like a flock.
PSA.80.1	You who sit enthroned between the cherubim,
PSA.80.1	shine forth 
PSA.80.2	before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh.
PSA.80.2	Awaken your might;
PSA.80.2	come and save us.
PSA.80.3	Restore us, O God;
PSA.80.3	make your face shine on us,
PSA.80.3	that we may be saved.
PSA.80.4	How long, 
PSA.80.4	will your anger smolder
PSA.80.4	against the prayers of your people?
PSA.80.5	You have fed them with the bread of tears;
PSA.80.5	you have made them drink tears by the bowlful.
PSA.80.6	You have made us an object of derision
PSA.80.6	and our enemies mock us.
PSA.80.7	Restore us, God Almighty;
PSA.80.7	make your face shine on us,
PSA.80.7	that we may be saved.
PSA.80.8	You transplanted a vine from Egypt;
PSA.80.8	you drove out the nations and planted it.
PSA.80.9	You cleared the ground for it,
PSA.80.9	and it took root and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	The mountains were covered with its shade,
PSA.80.10	the mighty cedars with its branches.
PSA.80.11	Its branches reached as far as the Sea,
PSA.80.11	its shoots as far as the River.
PSA.80.12	Why have you broken down its walls
PSA.80.12	so that all who pass by pick its grapes?
PSA.80.13	Boars from the forest ravage it,
PSA.80.13	and insects from the fields feed on it.
PSA.80.14	Return to us, God Almighty!
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven and see!
PSA.80.14	Watch over this vine,
PSA.80.15	the root your right hand has planted,
PSA.80.15	the son
PSA.80.16	Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire;
PSA.80.16	at your rebuke your people perish.
PSA.80.17	Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand,
PSA.80.17	the son of man you have raised up for yourself.
PSA.80.18	Then we will not turn away from you;
PSA.80.18	revive us, and we will call on your name.
PSA.80.19	Restore us, 
PSA.80.19	make your face shine on us,
PSA.80.19	that we may be saved.
PSA.81.1	Sing for joy to God our strength;
PSA.81.1	shout aloud to the God of Jacob!
PSA.81.2	Begin the music, strike the timbrel,
PSA.81.2	play the melodious harp and lyre.
PSA.81.3	Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon,
PSA.81.3	and when the moon is full, on the day of our festival;
PSA.81.4	this is a decree for Israel,
PSA.81.4	an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	When God went out against Egypt,
PSA.81.5	he established it as a statute for Joseph.
PSA.81.5	I heard an unknown voice say:
PSA.81.6	“I removed the burden from their shoulders;
PSA.81.6	their hands were set free from the basket.
PSA.81.7	In your distress you called and I rescued you,
PSA.81.7	I answered you out of a thundercloud;
PSA.81.7	I tested you at the waters of Meribah.
PSA.81.8	Hear me, my people, and I will warn you—
PSA.81.8	if you would only listen to me, Israel!
PSA.81.9	You shall have no foreign god among you;
PSA.81.9	you shall not worship any god other than me.
PSA.81.10	I am the 
PSA.81.10	who brought you up out of Egypt.
PSA.81.10	Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.
PSA.81.11	“But my people would not listen to me;
PSA.81.11	Israel would not submit to me.
PSA.81.12	So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts
PSA.81.12	to follow their own devices.
PSA.81.13	“If my people would only listen to me,
PSA.81.13	if Israel would only follow my ways,
PSA.81.14	how quickly I would subdue their enemies
PSA.81.14	and turn my hand against their foes!
PSA.81.15	Those who hate the 
PSA.81.15	and their punishment would last forever.
PSA.81.16	But you would be fed with the finest of wheat;
PSA.81.16	with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
PSA.82.1	God presides in the great assembly;
PSA.82.1	he renders judgment among the “gods”:
PSA.82.2	“How long will you
PSA.82.2	and show partiality to the wicked?
PSA.82.3	Defend the weak and the fatherless;
PSA.82.3	uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
PSA.82.4	Rescue the weak and the needy;
PSA.82.4	deliver them from the hand of the wicked.
PSA.82.5	“The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing.
PSA.82.5	They walk about in darkness;
PSA.82.5	all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
PSA.82.6	“I said, ‘You are “gods”;
PSA.82.6	you are all sons of the Most High.’
PSA.82.7	But you will die like mere mortals;
PSA.82.7	you will fall like every other ruler.”
PSA.82.8	Rise up, O God, judge the earth,
PSA.82.8	for all the nations are your inheritance.
PSA.83.1	O God, do not remain silent;
PSA.83.1	do not turn a deaf ear,
PSA.83.1	do not stand aloof, O God.
PSA.83.2	See how your enemies growl,
PSA.83.2	how your foes rear their heads.
PSA.83.3	With cunning they conspire against your people;
PSA.83.3	they plot against those you cherish.
PSA.83.4	“Come,” they say, “let us destroy them as a nation,
PSA.83.4	so that Israel’s name is remembered no more.”
PSA.83.5	With one mind they plot together;
PSA.83.5	they form an alliance against you—
PSA.83.6	the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
PSA.83.6	of Moab and the Hagrites,
PSA.83.7	Byblos, Ammon and Amalek,
PSA.83.7	Philistia, with the people of Tyre.
PSA.83.8	Even Assyria has joined them
PSA.83.8	to reinforce Lot’s descendants.
PSA.83.9	Do to them as you did to Midian,
PSA.83.9	as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,
PSA.83.10	who perished at Endor
PSA.83.10	and became like dung on the ground.
PSA.83.11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
PSA.83.11	all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
PSA.83.12	who said, “Let us take possession
PSA.83.12	of the pasturelands of God.”
PSA.83.13	Make them like tumbleweed, my God,
PSA.83.13	like chaff before the wind.
PSA.83.14	As fire consumes the forest
PSA.83.14	or a flame sets the mountains ablaze,
PSA.83.15	so pursue them with your tempest
PSA.83.15	and terrify them with your storm.
PSA.83.16	Cover their faces with shame, 
PSA.83.16	so that they will seek your name.
PSA.83.17	May they ever be ashamed and dismayed;
PSA.83.17	may they perish in disgrace.
PSA.83.18	Let them know that you, whose name is the 
PSA.83.18	that you alone are the Most High over all the earth.
PSA.84.1	How lovely is your dwelling place,
PSA.84.2	My soul yearns, even faints,
PSA.84.2	for the courts of the 
PSA.84.2	my heart and my flesh cry out
PSA.84.2	for the living God.
PSA.84.3	Even the sparrow has found a home,
PSA.84.3	and the swallow a nest for herself,
PSA.84.3	where she may have her young—
PSA.84.3	a place near your altar,
PSA.84.4	Blessed are those who dwell in your house;
PSA.84.4	they are ever praising you.
PSA.84.5	Blessed are those whose strength is in you,
PSA.84.5	whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
PSA.84.6	As they pass through the Valley of Baka,
PSA.84.6	they make it a place of springs;
PSA.84.6	the autumn rains also cover it with pools.
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength,
PSA.84.7	till each appears before God in Zion.
PSA.84.8	Hear my prayer, 
PSA.84.8	listen to me, God of Jacob.
PSA.84.9	Look on our shield,
PSA.84.9	look with favor on your anointed one.
PSA.84.10	Better is one day in your courts
PSA.84.10	than a thousand elsewhere;
PSA.84.10	I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God
PSA.84.10	than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.11	the 
PSA.84.11	no good thing does he withhold
PSA.84.11	from those whose walk is blameless.
PSA.84.12	blessed is the one who trusts in you.
PSA.85.1	You, 
PSA.85.1	you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
PSA.85.2	You forgave the iniquity of your people
PSA.85.2	and covered all their sins.
PSA.85.3	You set aside all your wrath
PSA.85.3	and turned from your fierce anger.
PSA.85.4	Restore us again, God our Savior,
PSA.85.4	and put away your displeasure toward us.
PSA.85.5	Will you be angry with us forever?
PSA.85.5	Will you prolong your anger through all generations?
PSA.85.6	Will you not revive us again,
PSA.85.6	that your people may rejoice in you?
PSA.85.7	Show us your unfailing love, 
PSA.85.7	and grant us your salvation.
PSA.85.8	I will listen to what God the 
PSA.85.8	he promises peace to his people, his faithful servants—
PSA.85.8	but let them not turn to folly.
PSA.85.9	Surely his salvation is near those who fear him,
PSA.85.9	that his glory may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Love and faithfulness meet together;
PSA.85.10	righteousness and peace kiss each other.
PSA.85.11	Faithfulness springs forth from the earth,
PSA.85.11	and righteousness looks down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	The 
PSA.85.12	and our land will yield its harvest.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness goes before him
PSA.85.13	and prepares the way for his steps.
PSA.86.1	Hear me, 
PSA.86.1	for I am poor and needy.
PSA.86.2	Guard my life, for I am faithful to you;
PSA.86.2	save your servant who trusts in you.
PSA.86.2	You are my God; 
PSA.86.3	have mercy on me, Lord,
PSA.86.3	for I call to you all day long.
PSA.86.4	Bring joy to your servant, Lord,
PSA.86.4	for I put my trust in you.
PSA.86.5	You, Lord, are forgiving and good,
PSA.86.5	abounding in love to all who call to you.
PSA.86.6	Hear my prayer, 
PSA.86.6	listen to my cry for mercy.
PSA.86.7	When I am in distress, I call to you,
PSA.86.7	because you answer me.
PSA.86.8	Among the gods there is none like you, Lord;
PSA.86.8	no deeds can compare with yours.
PSA.86.9	All the nations you have made
PSA.86.9	will come and worship before you, Lord;
PSA.86.9	they will bring glory to your name.
PSA.86.10	For you are great and do marvelous deeds;
PSA.86.10	you alone are God.
PSA.86.11	Teach me your way, 
PSA.86.11	that I may rely on your faithfulness;
PSA.86.11	give me an undivided heart,
PSA.86.11	that I may fear your name.
PSA.86.12	I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart;
PSA.86.12	I will glorify your name forever.
PSA.86.13	For great is your love toward me;
PSA.86.13	you have delivered me from the depths,
PSA.86.13	from the realm of the dead.
PSA.86.14	Arrogant foes are attacking me, O God;
PSA.86.14	ruthless people are trying to kill me—
PSA.86.14	they have no regard for you.
PSA.86.15	But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God,
PSA.86.15	slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.
PSA.86.16	Turn to me and have mercy on me;
PSA.86.16	show your strength in behalf of your servant;
PSA.86.16	save me, because I serve you
PSA.86.16	just as my mother did.
PSA.86.17	Give me a sign of your goodness,
PSA.86.17	that my enemies may see it and be put to shame,
PSA.86.17	for you, 
PSA.87.1	He has founded his city on the holy mountain.
PSA.87.2	The 
PSA.87.2	more than all the other dwellings of Jacob.
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are said of you,
PSA.87.3	city of God:
PSA.87.4	“I will record Rahab
PSA.87.4	among those who acknowledge me—
PSA.87.4	Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush
PSA.87.4	and will say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’ ”
PSA.87.5	Indeed, of Zion it will be said,
PSA.87.5	“This one and that one were born in her,
PSA.87.5	and the Most High himself will establish her.”
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.6	“This one was born in Zion.”
PSA.87.7	As they make music they will sing,
PSA.87.7	“All my fountains are in you.”
PSA.88.1	day and night I cry out to you.
PSA.88.2	May my prayer come before you;
PSA.88.2	turn your ear to my cry.
PSA.88.3	I am overwhelmed with troubles
PSA.88.3	and my life draws near to death.
PSA.88.4	I am counted among those who go down to the pit;
PSA.88.4	I am like one without strength.
PSA.88.5	I am set apart with the dead,
PSA.88.5	like the slain who lie in the grave,
PSA.88.5	whom you remember no more,
PSA.88.5	who are cut off from your care.
PSA.88.6	You have put me in the lowest pit,
PSA.88.6	in the darkest depths.
PSA.88.7	Your wrath lies heavily on me;
PSA.88.7	you have overwhelmed me with all your waves.
PSA.88.8	You have taken from me my closest friends
PSA.88.8	and have made me repulsive to them.
PSA.88.8	I am confined and cannot escape;
PSA.88.9	my eyes are dim with grief.
PSA.88.9	I call to you, 
PSA.88.9	I spread out my hands to you.
PSA.88.10	Do you show your wonders to the dead?
PSA.88.10	Do their spirits rise up and praise you?
PSA.88.11	Is your love declared in the grave,
PSA.88.11	your faithfulness in Destruction
PSA.88.12	Are your wonders known in the place of darkness,
PSA.88.12	or your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?
PSA.88.13	But I cry to you for help, 
PSA.88.13	in the morning my prayer comes before you.
PSA.88.14	Why, 
PSA.88.14	and hide your face from me?
PSA.88.15	From my youth I have suffered and been close to death;
PSA.88.15	I have borne your terrors and am in despair.
PSA.88.16	Your wrath has swept over me;
PSA.88.16	your terrors have destroyed me.
PSA.88.17	All day long they surround me like a flood;
PSA.88.17	they have completely engulfed me.
PSA.88.18	You have taken from me friend and neighbor—
PSA.88.18	darkness is my closest friend.
PSA.89.1	I will sing of the 
PSA.89.1	with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known
PSA.89.1	through all generations.
PSA.89.2	I will declare that your love stands firm forever,
PSA.89.2	that you have established your faithfulness in heaven itself.
PSA.89.3	You said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one,
PSA.89.3	I have sworn to David my servant,
PSA.89.4	‘I will establish your line forever
PSA.89.4	and make your throne firm through all generations.’ ”
PSA.89.5	The heavens praise your wonders, 
PSA.89.5	your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.
PSA.89.6	For who in the skies above can compare with the 
PSA.89.6	Who is like the 
PSA.89.7	In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared;
PSA.89.7	he is more awesome than all who surround him.
PSA.89.8	Who is like you, 
PSA.89.8	You, 
PSA.89.9	You rule over the surging sea;
PSA.89.9	when its waves mount up, you still them.
PSA.89.10	You crushed Rahab like one of the slain;
PSA.89.10	with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.
PSA.89.11	The heavens are yours, and yours also the earth;
PSA.89.11	you founded the world and all that is in it.
PSA.89.12	You created the north and the south;
PSA.89.12	Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name.
PSA.89.13	Your arm is endowed with power;
PSA.89.13	your hand is strong, your right hand exalted.
PSA.89.14	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne;
PSA.89.14	love and faithfulness go before you.
PSA.89.15	Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you,
PSA.89.15	who walk in the light of your presence, 
PSA.89.16	They rejoice in your name all day long;
PSA.89.16	they celebrate your righteousness.
PSA.89.17	For you are their glory and strength,
PSA.89.17	and by your favor you exalt our horn.
PSA.89.18	Indeed, our shield
PSA.89.18	our king to the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.89.19	Once you spoke in a vision,
PSA.89.19	to your faithful people you said:
PSA.89.19	“I have bestowed strength on a warrior;
PSA.89.19	I have raised up a young man from among the people.
PSA.89.20	I have found David my servant;
PSA.89.20	with my sacred oil I have anointed him.
PSA.89.21	My hand will sustain him;
PSA.89.21	surely my arm will strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	The enemy will not get the better of him;
PSA.89.22	the wicked will not oppress him.
PSA.89.23	I will crush his foes before him
PSA.89.23	and strike down his adversaries.
PSA.89.24	My faithful love will be with him,
PSA.89.24	and through my name his horn
PSA.89.25	I will set his hand over the sea,
PSA.89.25	his right hand over the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He will call out to me, ‘You are my Father,
PSA.89.26	my God, the Rock my Savior.’
PSA.89.27	And I will appoint him to be my firstborn,
PSA.89.27	the most exalted of the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	I will maintain my love to him forever,
PSA.89.28	and my covenant with him will never fail.
PSA.89.29	I will establish his line forever,
PSA.89.29	his throne as long as the heavens endure.
PSA.89.30	“If his sons forsake my law
PSA.89.30	and do not follow my statutes,
PSA.89.31	if they violate my decrees
PSA.89.31	and fail to keep my commands,
PSA.89.32	I will punish their sin with the rod,
PSA.89.32	their iniquity with flogging;
PSA.89.33	but I will not take my love from him,
PSA.89.33	nor will I ever betray my faithfulness.
PSA.89.34	I will not violate my covenant
PSA.89.34	or alter what my lips have uttered.
PSA.89.35	Once for all, I have sworn by my holiness—
PSA.89.35	and I will not lie to David—
PSA.89.36	that his line will continue forever
PSA.89.36	and his throne endure before me like the sun;
PSA.89.37	it will be established forever like the moon,
PSA.89.37	the faithful witness in the sky.”
PSA.89.38	But you have rejected, you have spurned,
PSA.89.38	you have been very angry with your anointed one.
PSA.89.39	You have renounced the covenant with your servant
PSA.89.39	and have defiled his crown in the dust.
PSA.89.40	You have broken through all his walls
PSA.89.40	and reduced his strongholds to ruins.
PSA.89.41	All who pass by have plundered him;
PSA.89.41	he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
PSA.89.42	You have exalted the right hand of his foes;
PSA.89.42	you have made all his enemies rejoice.
PSA.89.43	Indeed, you have turned back the edge of his sword
PSA.89.43	and have not supported him in battle.
PSA.89.44	You have put an end to his splendor
PSA.89.44	and cast his throne to the ground.
PSA.89.45	You have cut short the days of his youth;
PSA.89.45	you have covered him with a mantle of shame.
PSA.89.46	How long, 
PSA.89.46	How long will your wrath burn like fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember how fleeting is my life.
PSA.89.47	For what futility you have created all humanity!
PSA.89.48	Who can live and not see death,
PSA.89.48	or who can escape the power of the grave?
PSA.89.49	Lord, where is your former great love,
PSA.89.49	which in your faithfulness you swore to David?
PSA.89.50	Remember, Lord, how your servant has
PSA.89.50	how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations,
PSA.89.51	the taunts with which your enemies, 
PSA.89.51	with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one.
PSA.89.52	Praise be to the 
PSA.89.52	Amen and Amen.
PSA.90.1	Lord, you have been our dwelling place
PSA.90.1	throughout all generations.
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were born
PSA.90.2	or you brought forth the whole world,
PSA.90.2	from everlasting to everlasting you are God.
PSA.90.3	You turn people back to dust,
PSA.90.3	saying, “Return to dust, you mortals.”
PSA.90.4	A thousand years in your sight
PSA.90.4	are like a day that has just gone by,
PSA.90.4	or like a watch in the night.
PSA.90.5	Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death—
PSA.90.5	they are like the new grass of the morning:
PSA.90.6	In the morning it springs up new,
PSA.90.6	but by evening it is dry and withered.
PSA.90.7	We are consumed by your anger
PSA.90.7	and terrified by your indignation.
PSA.90.8	You have set our iniquities before you,
PSA.90.8	our secret sins in the light of your presence.
PSA.90.9	All our days pass away under your wrath;
PSA.90.9	we finish our years with a moan.
PSA.90.10	Our days may come to seventy years,
PSA.90.10	or eighty, if our strength endures;
PSA.90.10	yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow,
PSA.90.10	for they quickly pass, and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	If only we knew the power of your anger!
PSA.90.11	Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your due.
PSA.90.12	Teach us to number our days,
PSA.90.12	that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
PSA.90.13	Relent, 
PSA.90.13	Have compassion on your servants.
PSA.90.14	Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love,
PSA.90.14	that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
PSA.90.15	Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,
PSA.90.15	for as many years as we have seen trouble.
PSA.90.16	May your deeds be shown to your servants,
PSA.90.16	your splendor to their children.
PSA.90.17	May the favor
PSA.90.17	establish the work of our hands for us—
PSA.90.17	yes, establish the work of our hands.
PSA.91.1	Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High
PSA.91.1	will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	I will say of the 
PSA.91.2	my God, in whom I trust.”
PSA.91.3	Surely he will save you
PSA.91.3	from the fowler’s snare
PSA.91.3	and from the deadly pestilence.
PSA.91.4	He will cover you with his feathers,
PSA.91.4	and under his wings you will find refuge;
PSA.91.4	his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.
PSA.91.5	You will not fear the terror of night,
PSA.91.5	nor the arrow that flies by day,
PSA.91.6	nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,
PSA.91.6	nor the plague that destroys at midday.
PSA.91.7	A thousand may fall at your side,
PSA.91.7	ten thousand at your right hand,
PSA.91.7	but it will not come near you.
PSA.91.8	You will only observe with your eyes
PSA.91.8	and see the punishment of the wicked.
PSA.91.9	If you say, “The 
PSA.91.9	and you make the Most High your dwelling,
PSA.91.10	no harm will overtake you,
PSA.91.10	no disaster will come near your tent.
PSA.91.11	For he will command his angels concerning you
PSA.91.11	to guard you in all your ways;
PSA.91.12	they will lift you up in their hands,
PSA.91.12	so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
PSA.91.13	You will tread on the lion and the cobra;
PSA.91.13	you will trample the great lion and the serpent.
PSA.91.14	“Because he
PSA.91.14	I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.
PSA.91.15	He will call on me, and I will answer him;
PSA.91.15	I will be with him in trouble,
PSA.91.15	I will deliver him and honor him.
PSA.91.16	With long life I will satisfy him
PSA.91.16	and show him my salvation.”
PSA.92.1	It is good to praise the 
PSA.92.1	and make music to your name, O Most High,
PSA.92.2	proclaiming your love in the morning
PSA.92.2	and your faithfulness at night,
PSA.92.3	to the music of the ten-stringed lyre
PSA.92.3	and the melody of the harp.
PSA.92.4	For you make me glad by your deeds, 
PSA.92.4	I sing for joy at what your hands have done.
PSA.92.5	How great are your works, 
PSA.92.5	how profound your thoughts!
PSA.92.6	Senseless people do not know,
PSA.92.6	fools do not understand,
PSA.92.7	that though the wicked spring up like grass
PSA.92.7	and all evildoers flourish,
PSA.92.7	they will be destroyed forever.
PSA.92.8	But you, 
PSA.92.9	For surely your enemies, 
PSA.92.9	surely your enemies will perish;
PSA.92.9	all evildoers will be scattered.
PSA.92.10	You have exalted my horn
PSA.92.10	fine oils have been poured on me.
PSA.92.11	My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries;
PSA.92.11	my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes.
PSA.92.12	The righteous will flourish like a palm tree,
PSA.92.12	they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon;
PSA.92.13	planted in the house of the 
PSA.92.13	they will flourish in the courts of our God.
PSA.92.14	They will still bear fruit in old age,
PSA.92.14	they will stay fresh and green,
PSA.92.15	proclaiming, “The 
PSA.92.15	he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.”
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.1	the 
PSA.93.1	indeed, the world is established, firm and secure.
PSA.93.2	Your throne was established long ago;
PSA.93.2	you are from all eternity.
PSA.93.3	The seas have lifted up, 
PSA.93.3	the seas have lifted up their voice;
PSA.93.3	the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.
PSA.93.4	Mightier than the thunder of the great waters,
PSA.93.4	mightier than the breakers of the sea—
PSA.93.4	the 
PSA.93.5	Your statutes, 
PSA.93.5	holiness adorns your house
PSA.93.5	for endless days.
PSA.94.1	The 
PSA.94.1	O God who avenges, shine forth.
PSA.94.2	Rise up, Judge of the earth;
PSA.94.2	pay back to the proud what they deserve.
PSA.94.3	How long, 
PSA.94.3	how long will the wicked be jubilant?
PSA.94.4	They pour out arrogant words;
PSA.94.4	all the evildoers are full of boasting.
PSA.94.5	They crush your people, 
PSA.94.5	they oppress your inheritance.
PSA.94.6	They slay the widow and the foreigner;
PSA.94.6	they murder the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	They say, “The 
PSA.94.7	the God of Jacob takes no notice.”
PSA.94.8	Take notice, you senseless ones among the people;
PSA.94.8	you fools, when will you become wise?
PSA.94.9	Does he who fashioned the ear not hear?
PSA.94.9	Does he who formed the eye not see?
PSA.94.10	Does he who disciplines nations not punish?
PSA.94.10	Does he who teaches mankind lack knowledge?
PSA.94.11	The 
PSA.94.11	he knows that they are futile.
PSA.94.12	Blessed is the one you discipline, 
PSA.94.12	the one you teach from your law;
PSA.94.13	you grant them relief from days of trouble,
PSA.94.13	till a pit is dug for the wicked.
PSA.94.14	For the 
PSA.94.14	he will never forsake his inheritance.
PSA.94.15	Judgment will again be founded on righteousness,
PSA.94.15	and all the upright in heart will follow it.
PSA.94.16	Who will rise up for me against the wicked?
PSA.94.16	Who will take a stand for me against evildoers?
PSA.94.17	Unless the 
PSA.94.17	I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.
PSA.94.18	When I said, “My foot is slipping,”
PSA.94.18	your unfailing love, 
PSA.94.19	When anxiety was great within me,
PSA.94.19	your consolation brought me joy.
PSA.94.20	Can a corrupt throne be allied with you—
PSA.94.20	a throne that brings on misery by its decrees?
PSA.94.21	The wicked band together against the righteous
PSA.94.21	and condemn the innocent to death.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.22	and my God the rock in whom I take refuge.
PSA.94.23	He will repay them for their sins
PSA.94.23	and destroy them for their wickedness;
PSA.94.23	the 
PSA.95.1	Come, let us sing for joy to the 
PSA.95.1	let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation.

PSA.95.2	and extol him with music and song.
PSA.95.3	For the 
PSA.95.3	the great King above all gods.
PSA.95.4	In his hand are the depths of the earth,
PSA.95.4	and the mountain peaks belong to him.
PSA.95.5	The sea is his, for he made it,
PSA.95.5	and his hands formed the dry land.
PSA.95.6	Come, let us bow down in worship,
PSA.95.6	let us kneel before the 
PSA.95.7	for he is our God
PSA.95.7	and we are the people of his pasture,
PSA.95.7	the flock under his care.
PSA.95.7	Today, if only you would hear his voice,
PSA.95.8	“Do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah,
PSA.95.8	as you did that day at Massah
PSA.95.9	where your ancestors tested me;
PSA.95.9	they tried me, though they had seen what I did.
PSA.95.10	For forty years I was angry with that generation;
PSA.95.10	I said, ‘They are a people whose hearts go astray,
PSA.95.10	and they have not known my ways.’
PSA.95.11	So I declared on oath in my anger,
PSA.95.11	‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”

PSA.100.3	we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
PSA.100.4	Enter his gates with thanksgiving
PSA.100.4	and his courts with praise;
PSA.100.4	give thanks to him and praise his name.
PSA.100.5	For the 
PSA.100.5	his faithfulness continues through all generations.
PSA.101.1	I will sing of your love and justice;
PSA.101.1	to you, 
PSA.101.2	I will be careful to lead a blameless life—
PSA.101.2	when will you come to me?
PSA.101.2	I will conduct the affairs of my house
PSA.101.2	with a blameless heart.
PSA.101.3	I will not look with approval
PSA.101.3	on anything that is vile.
PSA.101.3	I hate what faithless people do;
PSA.101.3	I will have no part in it.
PSA.101.4	The perverse of heart shall be far from me;
PSA.101.4	I will have nothing to do with what is evil.
PSA.101.5	Whoever slanders their neighbor in secret,
PSA.101.5	I will put to silence;
PSA.101.5	whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart,
PSA.101.5	I will not tolerate.
PSA.101.6	My eyes will be on the faithful in the land,
PSA.101.6	that they may dwell with me;
PSA.101.6	the one whose walk is blameless
PSA.101.6	will minister to me.
PSA.101.7	No one who practices deceit
PSA.101.7	will dwell in my house;
PSA.101.7	no one who speaks falsely
PSA.101.7	will stand in my presence.
PSA.101.8	Every morning I will put to silence
PSA.101.8	all the wicked in the land;
PSA.101.8	I will cut off every evildoer
PSA.101.8	from the city of the 
PSA.102.1	Hear my prayer, 
PSA.102.1	let my cry for help come to you.
PSA.102.2	Do not hide your face from me
PSA.102.2	when I am in distress.
PSA.102.2	Turn your ear to me;
PSA.102.2	when I call, answer me quickly.
PSA.102.3	For my days vanish like smoke;
PSA.102.3	my bones burn like glowing embers.
PSA.102.4	My heart is blighted and withered like grass;
PSA.102.4	I forget to eat my food.
PSA.102.5	In my distress I groan aloud
PSA.102.5	and am reduced to skin and bones.
PSA.102.6	I am like a desert owl,
PSA.102.6	like an owl among the ruins.
PSA.102.7	I lie awake; I have become
PSA.102.7	like a bird alone on a roof.
PSA.102.8	All day long my enemies taunt me;
PSA.102.8	those who rail against me use my name as a curse.
PSA.102.9	For I eat ashes as my food
PSA.102.9	and mingle my drink with tears
PSA.102.10	because of your great wrath,
PSA.102.10	for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.
PSA.102.11	My days are like the evening shadow;
PSA.102.11	I wither away like grass.
PSA.102.12	But you, 
PSA.102.12	your renown endures through all generations.
PSA.102.13	You will arise and have compassion on Zion,
PSA.102.13	for it is time to show favor to her;
PSA.102.13	the appointed time has come.
PSA.102.14	For her stones are dear to your servants;
PSA.102.14	her very dust moves them to pity.
PSA.102.15	The nations will fear the name of the 
PSA.102.15	all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.
PSA.102.16	For the 
PSA.102.16	and appear in his glory.
PSA.102.17	He will respond to the prayer of the destitute;
PSA.102.17	he will not despise their plea.
PSA.102.18	Let this be written for a future generation,
PSA.102.18	that a people not yet created may praise the 
PSA.102.19	“The 
PSA.102.19	from heaven he viewed the earth,
PSA.102.20	to hear the groans of the prisoners
PSA.102.20	and release those condemned to death.”
PSA.102.21	So the name of the 
PSA.102.21	and his praise in Jerusalem
PSA.102.22	when the peoples and the kingdoms
PSA.102.22	assemble to worship the 
PSA.102.23	In the course of my life
PSA.102.23	he cut short my days.
PSA.102.24	So I said:
PSA.102.24	“Do not take me away, my God, in the midst of my days;
PSA.102.24	your years go on through all generations.
PSA.102.25	In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth,
PSA.102.25	and the heavens are the work of your hands.
PSA.102.26	They will perish, but you remain;
PSA.102.26	they will all wear out like a garment.
PSA.102.26	Like clothing you will change them
PSA.102.26	and they will be discarded.
PSA.102.27	But you remain the same,
PSA.102.27	and your years will never end.
PSA.102.28	The children of your servants will live in your presence;
PSA.102.28	their descendants will be established before you.”
PSA.103.1	Praise the 
PSA.103.1	all my inmost being, praise his holy name.
PSA.103.2	Praise the 
PSA.103.2	and forget not all his benefits—
PSA.103.3	who forgives all your sins
PSA.103.3	and heals all your diseases,
PSA.103.4	who redeems your life from the pit
PSA.103.4	and crowns you with love and compassion,
PSA.103.5	who satisfies your desires with good things
PSA.103.5	so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.6	and justice for all the oppressed.
PSA.103.7	He made known his ways to Moses,
PSA.103.7	his deeds to the people of Israel:
PSA.103.8	The 
PSA.103.8	slow to anger, abounding in love.
PSA.103.9	He will not always accuse,
PSA.103.9	nor will he harbor his anger forever;
PSA.103.10	he does not treat us as our sins deserve
PSA.103.10	or repay us according to our iniquities.
PSA.103.11	For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
PSA.103.11	so great is his love for those who fear him;
PSA.103.12	as far as the east is from the west,
PSA.103.12	so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
PSA.103.13	As a father has compassion on his children,
PSA.103.13	so the 
PSA.103.14	for he knows how we are formed,
PSA.103.14	he remembers that we are dust.
PSA.103.15	The life of mortals is like grass,
PSA.103.15	they flourish like a flower of the field;
PSA.103.16	the wind blows over it and it is gone,
PSA.103.16	and its place remembers it no more.
PSA.103.17	But from everlasting to everlasting
PSA.103.17	the 
PSA.103.17	and his righteousness with their children’s children—
PSA.103.18	with those who keep his covenant
PSA.103.18	and remember to obey his precepts.
PSA.103.19	The 
PSA.103.19	and his kingdom rules over all.
PSA.103.20	Praise the 
PSA.103.20	you mighty ones who do his bidding,
PSA.103.20	who obey his word.
PSA.103.21	Praise the 
PSA.103.21	you his servants who do his will.
PSA.103.22	Praise the 
PSA.103.22	everywhere in his dominion.
PSA.103.22	Praise the 
PSA.104.1	Praise the 
PSA.104.1	you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
PSA.104.2	The 
PSA.104.2	he stretches out the heavens like a tent
PSA.104.3	and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters.
PSA.104.3	He makes the clouds his chariot
PSA.104.3	and rides on the wings of the wind.
PSA.104.4	He makes winds his messengers,
PSA.104.4	flames of fire his servants.
PSA.104.5	He set the earth on its foundations;
PSA.104.5	it can never be moved.
PSA.104.6	You covered it with the watery depths as with a garment;
PSA.104.6	the waters stood above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	But at your rebuke the waters fled,
PSA.104.7	at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;
PSA.104.8	they flowed over the mountains,
PSA.104.8	they went down into the valleys,
PSA.104.8	to the place you assigned for them.
PSA.104.9	You set a boundary they cannot cross;
PSA.104.9	never again will they cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	He makes springs pour water into the ravines;
PSA.104.10	it flows between the mountains.
PSA.104.11	They give water to all the beasts of the field;
PSA.104.11	the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	The birds of the sky nest by the waters;
PSA.104.12	they sing among the branches.
PSA.104.13	He waters the mountains from his upper chambers;
PSA.104.13	the land is satisfied by the fruit of his work.
PSA.104.14	He makes grass grow for the cattle,
PSA.104.14	and plants for people to cultivate—
PSA.104.14	bringing forth food from the earth:
PSA.104.15	wine that gladdens human hearts,
PSA.104.15	oil to make their faces shine,
PSA.104.15	and bread that sustains their hearts.
PSA.104.16	The trees of the 
PSA.104.16	the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
PSA.104.17	There the birds make their nests;
PSA.104.17	the stork has its home in the junipers.
PSA.104.18	The high mountains belong to the wild goats;
PSA.104.18	the crags are a refuge for the hyrax.
PSA.104.19	He made the moon to mark the seasons,
PSA.104.19	and the sun knows when to go down.
PSA.104.20	You bring darkness, it becomes night,
PSA.104.20	and all the beasts of the forest prowl.
PSA.104.21	The lions roar for their prey
PSA.104.21	and seek their food from God.
PSA.104.22	The sun rises, and they steal away;
PSA.104.22	they return and lie down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Then people go out to their work,
PSA.104.23	to their labor until evening.
PSA.104.24	How many are your works, 
PSA.104.24	In wisdom you made them all;
PSA.104.24	the earth is full of your creatures.
PSA.104.25	There is the sea, vast and spacious,
PSA.104.25	teeming with creatures beyond number—
PSA.104.25	living things both large and small.
PSA.104.26	There the ships go to and fro,
PSA.104.26	and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.
PSA.104.27	All creatures look to you
PSA.104.27	to give them their food at the proper time.
PSA.104.28	When you give it to them,
PSA.104.28	they gather it up;
PSA.104.28	when you open your hand,
PSA.104.28	they are satisfied with good things.
PSA.104.29	When you hide your face,
PSA.104.29	they are terrified;
PSA.104.29	when you take away their breath,
PSA.104.29	they die and return to the dust.
PSA.104.30	When you send your Spirit,
PSA.104.30	they are created,
PSA.104.30	and you renew the face of the ground.
PSA.104.31	May the glory of the 
PSA.104.31	may the 
PSA.104.32	he who looks at the earth, and it trembles,
PSA.104.32	who touches the mountains, and they smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing to the 
PSA.104.33	I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
PSA.104.34	May my meditation be pleasing to him,
PSA.104.34	as I rejoice in the 
PSA.104.35	But may sinners vanish from the earth
PSA.104.35	and the wicked be no more.
PSA.104.35	Praise the 
PSA.104.35	Praise the 
PSA.105.1	Give praise to the 
PSA.105.1	make known among the nations what he has done.
PSA.105.2	Sing to him, sing praise to him;
PSA.105.2	tell of all his wonderful acts.
PSA.105.3	Glory in his holy name;
PSA.105.3	let the hearts of those who seek the 
PSA.105.4	Look to the 
PSA.105.4	seek his face always.
PSA.105.5	Remember the wonders he has done,
PSA.105.5	his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,
PSA.105.6	you his servants, the descendants of Abraham,
PSA.105.6	his chosen ones, the children of Jacob.
PSA.105.7	He is the 
PSA.105.7	his judgments are in all the earth.
PSA.105.8	He remembers his covenant forever,
PSA.105.8	the promise he made, for a thousand generations,
PSA.105.9	the covenant he made with Abraham,
PSA.105.9	the oath he swore to Isaac.
PSA.105.10	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
PSA.105.10	to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
PSA.105.11	“To you I will give the land of Canaan
PSA.105.11	as the portion you will inherit.”
PSA.105.12	When they were but few in number,
PSA.105.12	few indeed, and strangers in it,
PSA.105.13	they wandered from nation to nation,
PSA.105.13	from one kingdom to another.
PSA.105.14	He allowed no one to oppress them;
PSA.105.14	for their sake he rebuked kings:
PSA.105.15	“Do not touch my anointed ones;
PSA.105.15	do my prophets no harm.”
PSA.105.16	He called down famine on the land
PSA.105.16	and destroyed all their supplies of food;
PSA.105.17	and he sent a man before them—
PSA.105.17	Joseph, sold as a slave.
PSA.105.18	They bruised his feet with shackles,
PSA.105.18	his neck was put in irons,
PSA.105.19	till what he foretold came to pass,
PSA.105.19	till the word of the 
PSA.105.20	The king sent and released him,
PSA.105.20	the ruler of peoples set him free.
PSA.105.21	He made him master of his household,
PSA.105.21	ruler over all he possessed,
PSA.105.22	to instruct his princes as he pleased
PSA.105.22	and teach his elders wisdom.
PSA.105.23	Then Israel entered Egypt;
PSA.105.23	Jacob resided as a foreigner in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	The 
PSA.105.24	he made them too numerous for their foes,
PSA.105.25	whose hearts he turned to hate his people,
PSA.105.25	to conspire against his servants.
PSA.105.26	He sent Moses his servant,
PSA.105.26	and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
PSA.105.27	They performed his signs among them,
PSA.105.27	his wonders in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness and made the land dark—
PSA.105.28	for had they not rebelled against his words?
PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood,
PSA.105.29	causing their fish to die.
PSA.105.30	Their land teemed with frogs,
PSA.105.30	which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,
PSA.105.31	and gnats throughout their country.
PSA.105.32	He turned their rain into hail,
PSA.105.32	with lightning throughout their land;
PSA.105.33	he struck down their vines and fig trees
PSA.105.33	and shattered the trees of their country.
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and the locusts came,
PSA.105.34	grasshoppers without number;
PSA.105.35	they ate up every green thing in their land,
PSA.105.35	ate up the produce of their soil.
PSA.105.36	Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land,
PSA.105.36	the firstfruits of all their manhood.
PSA.105.37	He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold,
PSA.105.37	and from among their tribes no one faltered.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they left,
PSA.105.38	because dread of Israel had fallen on them.
PSA.105.39	He spread out a cloud as a covering,
PSA.105.39	and a fire to give light at night.
PSA.105.40	They asked, and he brought them quail;
PSA.105.40	he fed them well with the bread of heaven.
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock, and water gushed out;
PSA.105.41	it flowed like a river in the desert.
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his holy promise
PSA.105.42	given to his servant Abraham.
PSA.105.43	He brought out his people with rejoicing,
PSA.105.43	his chosen ones with shouts of joy;
PSA.105.44	he gave them the lands of the nations,
PSA.105.44	and they fell heir to what others had toiled for—
PSA.105.45	that they might keep his precepts
PSA.105.45	and observe his laws.
PSA.105.45	Praise the 
PSA.106.1	Praise the 
PSA.106.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.106.1	his love endures forever.
PSA.106.2	Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the 
PSA.106.2	or fully declare his praise?
PSA.106.3	Blessed are those who act justly,
PSA.106.3	who always do what is right.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, 
PSA.106.4	come to my aid when you save them,
PSA.106.5	that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones,
PSA.106.5	that I may share in the joy of your nation
PSA.106.5	and join your inheritance in giving praise.
PSA.106.6	We have sinned, even as our ancestors did;
PSA.106.6	we have done wrong and acted wickedly.
PSA.106.7	When our ancestors were in Egypt,
PSA.106.7	they gave no thought to your miracles;
PSA.106.7	they did not remember your many kindnesses,
PSA.106.7	and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	Yet he saved them for his name’s sake,
PSA.106.8	to make his mighty power known.
PSA.106.9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up;
PSA.106.9	he led them through the depths as through a desert.
PSA.106.10	He saved them from the hand of the foe;
PSA.106.10	from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.
PSA.106.11	The waters covered their adversaries;
PSA.106.11	not one of them survived.
PSA.106.12	Then they believed his promises
PSA.106.12	and sang his praise.
PSA.106.13	But they soon forgot what he had done
PSA.106.13	and did not wait for his plan to unfold.
PSA.106.14	In the desert they gave in to their craving;
PSA.106.14	in the wilderness they put God to the test.
PSA.106.15	So he gave them what they asked for,
PSA.106.15	but sent a wasting disease among them.
PSA.106.16	In the camp they grew envious of Moses
PSA.106.16	and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the 
PSA.106.17	The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;
PSA.106.17	it buried the company of Abiram.
PSA.106.18	Fire blazed among their followers;
PSA.106.18	a flame consumed the wicked.
PSA.106.19	At Horeb they made a calf
PSA.106.19	and worshiped an idol cast from metal.
PSA.106.20	They exchanged their glorious God
PSA.106.20	for an image of a bull, which eats grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgot the God who saved them,
PSA.106.21	who had done great things in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	miracles in the land of Ham
PSA.106.22	and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
PSA.106.23	So he said he would destroy them—
PSA.106.23	had not Moses, his chosen one,
PSA.106.23	stood in the breach before him
PSA.106.23	to keep his wrath from destroying them.
PSA.106.24	Then they despised the pleasant land;
PSA.106.24	they did not believe his promise.
PSA.106.25	They grumbled in their tents
PSA.106.25	and did not obey the 
PSA.106.26	So he swore to them with uplifted hand
PSA.106.26	that he would make them fall in the wilderness,
PSA.106.27	make their descendants fall among the nations
PSA.106.27	and scatter them throughout the lands.
PSA.106.28	They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor
PSA.106.28	and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;
PSA.106.29	they aroused the 
PSA.106.29	and a plague broke out among them.
PSA.106.30	But Phinehas stood up and intervened,
PSA.106.30	and the plague was checked.
PSA.106.31	This was credited to him as righteousness
PSA.106.31	for endless generations to come.
PSA.106.32	By the waters of Meribah they angered the 
PSA.106.32	and trouble came to Moses because of them;
PSA.106.33	for they rebelled against the Spirit of God,
PSA.106.33	and rash words came from Moses’ lips.
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the peoples
PSA.106.34	as the 
PSA.106.35	but they mingled with the nations
PSA.106.35	and adopted their customs.
PSA.106.36	They worshiped their idols,
PSA.106.36	which became a snare to them.
PSA.106.37	They sacrificed their sons
PSA.106.37	and their daughters to false gods.
PSA.106.38	They shed innocent blood,
PSA.106.38	the blood of their sons and daughters,
PSA.106.38	whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
PSA.106.38	and the land was desecrated by their blood.
PSA.106.39	They defiled themselves by what they did;
PSA.106.39	by their deeds they prostituted themselves.
PSA.106.40	Therefore the 
PSA.106.40	and abhorred his inheritance.
PSA.106.41	He gave them into the hands of the nations,
PSA.106.41	and their foes ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies oppressed them
PSA.106.42	and subjected them to their power.
PSA.106.43	Many times he delivered them,
PSA.106.43	but they were bent on rebellion
PSA.106.43	and they wasted away in their sin.
PSA.106.44	Yet he took note of their distress
PSA.106.44	when he heard their cry;
PSA.106.45	for their sake he remembered his covenant
PSA.106.45	and out of his great love he relented.
PSA.106.46	He caused all who held them captive
PSA.106.46	to show them mercy.
PSA.106.47	Save us, 
PSA.106.47	and gather us from the nations,
PSA.106.47	that we may give thanks to your holy name
PSA.106.47	and glory in your praise.
PSA.106.48	Praise be to the 
PSA.106.48	from everlasting to everlasting.
PSA.106.48	Let all the people say, “Amen!”
PSA.106.48	Praise the 
PSA.107.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.107.1	his love endures forever.
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the 
PSA.107.2	those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,
PSA.107.3	those he gathered from the lands,
PSA.107.3	from east and west, from north and south.
PSA.107.4	Some wandered in desert wastelands,
PSA.107.4	finding no way to a city where they could settle.
PSA.107.5	They were hungry and thirsty,
PSA.107.5	and their lives ebbed away.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried out to the 
PSA.107.6	and he delivered them from their distress.
PSA.107.7	He led them by a straight way
PSA.107.7	to a city where they could settle.
PSA.107.8	Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.8	and his wonderful deeds for mankind,
PSA.107.9	for he satisfies the thirsty
PSA.107.9	and fills the hungry with good things.
PSA.107.10	Some sat in darkness, in utter darkness,
PSA.107.10	prisoners suffering in iron chains,
PSA.107.11	because they rebelled against God’s commands
PSA.107.11	and despised the plans of the Most High.
PSA.107.12	So he subjected them to bitter labor;
PSA.107.12	they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
PSA.107.13	Then they cried to the 
PSA.107.13	and he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness, the utter darkness,
PSA.107.14	and broke away their chains.
PSA.107.15	Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.15	and his wonderful deeds for mankind,
PSA.107.16	for he breaks down gates of bronze
PSA.107.16	and cuts through bars of iron.
PSA.107.17	Some became fools through their rebellious ways
PSA.107.17	and suffered affliction because of their iniquities.
PSA.107.18	They loathed all food
PSA.107.18	and drew near the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cried to the 
PSA.107.19	and he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.20	He sent out his word and healed them;
PSA.107.20	he rescued them from the grave.
PSA.107.21	Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.21	and his wonderful deeds for mankind.
PSA.107.22	Let them sacrifice thank offerings
PSA.107.22	and tell of his works with songs of joy.
PSA.107.23	Some went out on the sea in ships;
PSA.107.23	they were merchants on the mighty waters.
PSA.107.24	They saw the works of the 
PSA.107.24	his wonderful deeds in the deep.
PSA.107.25	For he spoke and stirred up a tempest
PSA.107.25	that lifted high the waves.
PSA.107.26	They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths;
PSA.107.26	in their peril their courage melted away.
PSA.107.27	They reeled and staggered like drunkards;
PSA.107.27	they were at their wits’ end.
PSA.107.28	Then they cried out to the 
PSA.107.28	and he brought them out of their distress.
PSA.107.29	He stilled the storm to a whisper;
PSA.107.29	the waves of the sea
PSA.107.30	They were glad when it grew calm,
PSA.107.30	and he guided them to their desired haven.
PSA.107.31	Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.31	and his wonderful deeds for mankind.
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people
PSA.107.32	and praise him in the council of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He turned rivers into a desert,
PSA.107.33	flowing springs into thirsty ground,
PSA.107.34	and fruitful land into a salt waste,
PSA.107.34	because of the wickedness of those who lived there.
PSA.107.35	He turned the desert into pools of water
PSA.107.35	and the parched ground into flowing springs;
PSA.107.36	there he brought the hungry to live,
PSA.107.36	and they founded a city where they could settle.
PSA.107.37	They sowed fields and planted vineyards
PSA.107.37	that yielded a fruitful harvest;
PSA.107.38	he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased,
PSA.107.38	and he did not let their herds diminish.
PSA.107.39	Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled
PSA.107.39	by oppression, calamity and sorrow;
PSA.107.40	he who pours contempt on nobles
PSA.107.40	made them wander in a trackless waste.
PSA.107.41	But he lifted the needy out of their affliction
PSA.107.41	and increased their families like flocks.
PSA.107.42	The upright see and rejoice,
PSA.107.42	but all the wicked shut their mouths.
PSA.107.43	Let the one who is wise heed these things
PSA.107.43	and ponder the loving deeds of the 
PSA.108.1	My heart, O God, is steadfast;
PSA.108.1	I will sing and make music with all my soul.
PSA.108.2	Awake, harp and lyre!
PSA.108.2	I will awaken the dawn.
PSA.108.3	I will praise you, 
PSA.108.3	I will sing of you among the peoples.
PSA.108.4	For great is your love, higher than the heavens;
PSA.108.4	your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
PSA.108.5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
PSA.108.5	let your glory be over all the earth.
PSA.108.6	Save us and help us with your right hand,
PSA.108.6	that those you love may be delivered.
PSA.108.7	God has spoken from his sanctuary:
PSA.108.7	“In triumph I will parcel out Shechem
PSA.108.7	and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine;
PSA.108.8	Ephraim is my helmet,
PSA.108.8	Judah is my scepter.
PSA.108.9	Moab is my washbasin,
PSA.108.9	on Edom I toss my sandal;
PSA.108.9	over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me to the fortified city?
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.108.11	Is it not you, God, you who have rejected us
PSA.108.11	and no longer go out with our armies?
PSA.108.12	Give us aid against the enemy,
PSA.108.12	for human help is worthless.
PSA.108.13	With God we will gain the victory,
PSA.108.13	and he will trample down our enemies.
PSA.109.1	My God, whom I praise,
PSA.109.1	do not remain silent,
PSA.109.2	for people who are wicked and deceitful
PSA.109.2	have opened their mouths against me;
PSA.109.2	they have spoken against me with lying tongues.
PSA.109.3	With words of hatred they surround me;
PSA.109.3	they attack me without cause.
PSA.109.4	In return for my friendship they accuse me,
PSA.109.4	but I am a man of prayer.
PSA.109.5	They repay me evil for good,
PSA.109.5	and hatred for my friendship.
PSA.109.6	Appoint someone evil to oppose my enemy;
PSA.109.6	let an accuser stand at his right hand.
PSA.109.7	When he is tried, let him be found guilty,
PSA.109.7	and may his prayers condemn him.
PSA.109.8	May his days be few;
PSA.109.8	may another take his place of leadership.
PSA.109.9	May his children be fatherless
PSA.109.9	and his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	May his children be wandering beggars;
PSA.109.10	may they be driven
PSA.109.11	May a creditor seize all he has;
PSA.109.11	may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.
PSA.109.12	May no one extend kindness to him
PSA.109.12	or take pity on his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	May his descendants be cut off,
PSA.109.13	their names blotted out from the next generation.
PSA.109.14	May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the 
PSA.109.14	may the sin of his mother never be blotted out.
PSA.109.15	May their sins always remain before the 
PSA.109.15	that he may blot out their name from the earth.
PSA.109.16	For he never thought of doing a kindness,
PSA.109.16	but hounded to death the poor
PSA.109.16	and the needy and the brokenhearted.
PSA.109.17	He loved to pronounce a curse—
PSA.109.17	may it come back on him.
PSA.109.17	He found no pleasure in blessing—
PSA.109.17	may it be far from him.
PSA.109.18	He wore cursing as his garment;
PSA.109.18	it entered into his body like water,
PSA.109.18	into his bones like oil.
PSA.109.19	May it be like a cloak wrapped about him,
PSA.109.19	like a belt tied forever around him.
PSA.109.20	May this be the 
PSA.109.20	to those who speak evil of me.
PSA.109.21	But you, Sovereign 
PSA.109.21	help me for your name’s sake;
PSA.109.21	out of the goodness of your love, deliver me.
PSA.109.22	For I am poor and needy,
PSA.109.22	and my heart is wounded within me.
PSA.109.23	I fade away like an evening shadow;
PSA.109.23	I am shaken off like a locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees give way from fasting;
PSA.109.24	my body is thin and gaunt.
PSA.109.25	I am an object of scorn to my accusers;
PSA.109.25	when they see me, they shake their heads.
PSA.109.26	Help me, 
PSA.109.26	save me according to your unfailing love.
PSA.109.27	Let them know that it is your hand,
PSA.109.27	that you, 
PSA.109.28	While they curse, may you bless;
PSA.109.28	may those who attack me be put to shame,
PSA.109.28	but may your servant rejoice.
PSA.109.29	May my accusers be clothed with disgrace
PSA.109.29	and wrapped in shame as in a cloak.
PSA.109.30	With my mouth I will greatly extol the 
PSA.109.30	in the great throng of worshipers I will praise him.
PSA.109.31	For he stands at the right hand of the needy,
PSA.109.31	to save their lives from those who would condemn them.
PSA.110.1	The 
PSA.110.1	“Sit at my right hand
PSA.110.1	until I make your enemies

PSA.110.6	He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead
PSA.110.6	and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.

PSA.119.27	Cause me to understand the way of your precepts,
PSA.119.27	that I may meditate on your wonderful deeds.

PSA.119.42	then I can answer anyone who taunts me,
PSA.119.42	for I trust in your word.
PSA.119.43	Never take your word of truth from my mouth,
PSA.119.43	for I have put my hope in your laws.
PSA.119.44	I will always obey your law,
PSA.119.44	for ever and ever.
PSA.119.45	I will walk about in freedom,
PSA.119.45	for I have sought out your precepts.
PSA.119.46	I will speak of your statutes before kings
PSA.119.46	and will not be put to shame,
PSA.119.47	for I delight in your commands
PSA.119.47	because I love them.
PSA.119.48	I reach out for your commands, which I love,
PSA.119.48	that I may meditate on your decrees.
PSA.119.49	Remember your word to your servant,
PSA.119.49	for you have given me hope.
PSA.119.50	My comfort in my suffering is this:
PSA.119.50	Your promise preserves my life.
PSA.119.51	The arrogant mock me unmercifully,
PSA.119.51	but I do not turn from your law.
PSA.119.52	I remember, 
PSA.119.52	and I find comfort in them.
PSA.119.53	Indignation grips me because of the wicked,
PSA.119.53	who have forsaken your law.
PSA.119.54	Your decrees are the theme of my song
PSA.119.54	wherever I lodge.
PSA.119.55	In the night, 
PSA.119.55	that I may keep your law.
PSA.119.56	This has been my practice:
PSA.119.56	I obey your precepts.
PSA.119.57	You are my portion, 
PSA.119.57	I have promised to obey your words.
PSA.119.58	I have sought your face with all my heart;
PSA.119.58	be gracious to me according to your promise.
PSA.119.59	I have considered my ways
PSA.119.59	and have turned my steps to your statutes.
PSA.119.60	I will hasten and not delay
PSA.119.60	to obey your commands.
PSA.119.61	Though the wicked bind me with ropes,
PSA.119.61	I will not forget your law.
PSA.119.62	At midnight I rise to give you thanks
PSA.119.62	for your righteous laws.
PSA.119.63	I am a friend to all who fear you,
PSA.119.63	to all who follow your precepts.
PSA.119.64	The earth is filled with your love, 
PSA.119.64	teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.65	Do good to your servant
PSA.119.65	according to your word, 
PSA.119.66	Teach me knowledge and good judgment,
PSA.119.66	for I trust your commands.
PSA.119.67	Before I was afflicted I went astray,
PSA.119.67	but now I obey your word.
PSA.119.68	You are good, and what you do is good;
PSA.119.68	teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.69	Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies,
PSA.119.69	I keep your precepts with all my heart.
PSA.119.70	Their hearts are callous and unfeeling,
PSA.119.70	but I delight in your law.
PSA.119.71	It was good for me to be afflicted
PSA.119.71	so that I might learn your decrees.
PSA.119.72	The law from your mouth is more precious to me
PSA.119.72	than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.
PSA.119.73	Your hands made me and formed me;
PSA.119.73	give me understanding to learn your commands.
PSA.119.74	May those who fear you rejoice when they see me,
PSA.119.74	for I have put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.75	I know, 
PSA.119.75	and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
PSA.119.76	May your unfailing love be my comfort,
PSA.119.76	according to your promise to your servant.
PSA.119.77	Let your compassion come to me that I may live,
PSA.119.77	for your law is my delight.
PSA.119.78	May the arrogant be put to shame for wronging me without cause;
PSA.119.78	but I will meditate on your precepts.
PSA.119.79	May those who fear you turn to me,
PSA.119.79	those who understand your statutes.
PSA.119.80	May I wholeheartedly follow your decrees,
PSA.119.80	that I may not be put to shame.
PSA.119.81	My soul faints with longing for your salvation,
PSA.119.81	but I have put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.82	My eyes fail, looking for your promise;
PSA.119.82	I say, “When will you comfort me?”
PSA.119.83	Though I am like a wineskin in the smoke,
PSA.119.83	I do not forget your decrees.
PSA.119.84	How long must your servant wait?
PSA.119.84	When will you punish my persecutors?
PSA.119.85	The arrogant dig pits to trap me,
PSA.119.85	contrary to your law.
PSA.119.86	All your commands are trustworthy;
PSA.119.86	help me, for I am being persecuted without cause.
PSA.119.87	They almost wiped me from the earth,
PSA.119.87	but I have not forsaken your precepts.
PSA.119.88	In your unfailing love preserve my life,
PSA.119.88	that I may obey the statutes of your mouth.
PSA.119.89	Your word, 
PSA.119.89	it stands firm in the heavens.
PSA.119.90	Your faithfulness continues through all generations;
PSA.119.90	you established the earth, and it endures.
PSA.119.91	Your laws endure to this day,
PSA.119.91	for all things serve you.
PSA.119.92	If your law had not been my delight,
PSA.119.92	I would have perished in my affliction.
PSA.119.93	I will never forget your precepts,
PSA.119.93	for by them you have preserved my life.
PSA.119.94	Save me, for I am yours;
PSA.119.94	I have sought out your precepts.
PSA.119.95	The wicked are waiting to destroy me,
PSA.119.95	but I will ponder your statutes.
PSA.119.96	To all perfection I see a limit,
PSA.119.96	but your commands are boundless.
PSA.119.97	Oh, how I love your law!
PSA.119.97	I meditate on it all day long.
PSA.119.98	Your commands are always with me
PSA.119.98	and make me wiser than my enemies.
PSA.119.99	I have more insight than all my teachers,
PSA.119.99	for I meditate on your statutes.
PSA.119.100	I have more understanding than the elders,
PSA.119.100	for I obey your precepts.
PSA.119.101	I have kept my feet from every evil path
PSA.119.101	so that I might obey your word.
PSA.119.102	I have not departed from your laws,
PSA.119.102	for you yourself have taught me.
PSA.119.103	How sweet are your words to my taste,
PSA.119.103	sweeter than honey to my mouth!
PSA.119.104	I gain understanding from your precepts;
PSA.119.104	therefore I hate every wrong path.
PSA.119.105	Your word is a lamp for my feet,
PSA.119.105	a light on my path.
PSA.119.106	I have taken an oath and confirmed it,
PSA.119.106	that I will follow your righteous laws.
PSA.119.107	I have suffered much;
PSA.119.107	preserve my life, 
PSA.119.108	Accept, 
PSA.119.108	and teach me your laws.
PSA.119.109	Though I constantly take my life in my hands,
PSA.119.109	I will not forget your law.
PSA.119.110	The wicked have set a snare for me,
PSA.119.110	but I have not strayed from your precepts.
PSA.119.111	Your statutes are my heritage forever;
PSA.119.111	they are the joy of my heart.
PSA.119.112	My heart is set on keeping your decrees
PSA.119.112	to the very end.
PSA.119.113	I hate double-minded people,
PSA.119.113	but I love your law.
PSA.119.114	You are my refuge and my shield;
PSA.119.114	I have put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.115	Away from me, you evildoers,
PSA.119.115	that I may keep the commands of my God!
PSA.119.116	Sustain me, my God, according to your promise, and I will live;
PSA.119.116	do not let my hopes be dashed.
PSA.119.117	Uphold me, and I will be delivered;
PSA.119.117	I will always have regard for your decrees.
PSA.119.118	You reject all who stray from your decrees,
PSA.119.118	for their delusions come to nothing.
PSA.119.119	All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross;
PSA.119.119	therefore I love your statutes.
PSA.119.120	My flesh trembles in fear of you;
PSA.119.120	I stand in awe of your laws.
PSA.119.121	I have done what is righteous and just;
PSA.119.121	do not leave me to my oppressors.
PSA.119.122	Ensure your servant’s well-being;
PSA.119.122	do not let the arrogant oppress me.
PSA.119.123	My eyes fail, looking for your salvation,
PSA.119.123	looking for your righteous promise.
PSA.119.124	Deal with your servant according to your love
PSA.119.124	and teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.125	I am your servant; give me discernment
PSA.119.125	that I may understand your statutes.
PSA.119.126	It is time for you to act, 
PSA.119.126	your law is being broken.
PSA.119.127	Because I love your commands
PSA.119.127	more than gold, more than pure gold,
PSA.119.128	and because I consider all your precepts right,
PSA.119.128	I hate every wrong path.
PSA.119.129	Your statutes are wonderful;
PSA.119.129	therefore I obey them.
PSA.119.130	The unfolding of your words gives light;
PSA.119.130	it gives understanding to the simple.
PSA.119.131	I open my mouth and pant,
PSA.119.131	longing for your commands.
PSA.119.132	Turn to me and have mercy on me,
PSA.119.132	as you always do to those who love your name.
PSA.119.133	Direct my footsteps according to your word;
PSA.119.133	let no sin rule over me.
PSA.119.134	Redeem me from human oppression,
PSA.119.134	that I may obey your precepts.
PSA.119.135	Make your face shine on your servant
PSA.119.135	and teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.136	Streams of tears flow from my eyes,
PSA.119.136	for your law is not obeyed.
PSA.119.137	You are righteous, 
PSA.119.137	and your laws are right.
PSA.119.138	The statutes you have laid down are righteous;
PSA.119.138	they are fully trustworthy.
PSA.119.139	My zeal wears me out,
PSA.119.139	for my enemies ignore your words.
PSA.119.140	Your promises have been thoroughly tested,
PSA.119.140	and your servant loves them.
PSA.119.141	Though I am lowly and despised,
PSA.119.141	I do not forget your precepts.
PSA.119.142	Your righteousness is everlasting
PSA.119.142	and your law is true.
PSA.119.143	Trouble and distress have come upon me,
PSA.119.143	but your commands give me delight.
PSA.119.144	Your statutes are always righteous;
PSA.119.144	give me understanding that I may live.
PSA.119.145	I call with all my heart; answer me, 
PSA.119.145	and I will obey your decrees.
PSA.119.146	I call out to you; save me
PSA.119.146	and I will keep your statutes.
PSA.119.147	I rise before dawn and cry for help;
PSA.119.147	I have put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.148	My eyes stay open through the watches of the night,
PSA.119.148	that I may meditate on your promises.
PSA.119.149	Hear my voice in accordance with your love;
PSA.119.149	preserve my life, 
PSA.119.150	Those who devise wicked schemes are near,
PSA.119.150	but they are far from your law.
PSA.119.151	Yet you are near, 
PSA.119.151	and all your commands are true.
PSA.119.152	Long ago I learned from your statutes
PSA.119.152	that you established them to last forever.
PSA.119.153	Look on my suffering and deliver me,
PSA.119.153	for I have not forgotten your law.
PSA.119.154	Defend my cause and redeem me;
PSA.119.154	preserve my life according to your promise.
PSA.119.155	Salvation is far from the wicked,
PSA.119.155	for they do not seek out your decrees.
PSA.119.156	Your compassion, 
PSA.119.156	preserve my life according to your laws.
PSA.119.157	Many are the foes who persecute me,
PSA.119.157	but I have not turned from your statutes.
PSA.119.158	I look on the faithless with loathing,
PSA.119.158	for they do not obey your word.
PSA.119.159	See how I love your precepts;
PSA.119.159	preserve my life, 
PSA.119.160	All your words are true;
PSA.119.160	all your righteous laws are eternal.
PSA.119.161	Rulers persecute me without cause,
PSA.119.161	but my heart trembles at your word.
PSA.119.162	I rejoice in your promise
PSA.119.162	like one who finds great spoil.
PSA.119.163	I hate and detest falsehood
PSA.119.163	but I love your law.
PSA.119.164	Seven times a day I praise you
PSA.119.164	for your righteous laws.
PSA.119.165	Great peace have those who love your law,
PSA.119.165	and nothing can make them stumble.
PSA.119.166	I wait for your salvation, 
PSA.119.166	and I follow your commands.
PSA.119.167	I obey your statutes,
PSA.119.167	for I love them greatly.
PSA.119.168	I obey your precepts and your statutes,
PSA.119.168	for all my ways are known to you.
PSA.119.169	May my cry come before you, 
PSA.119.169	give me understanding according to your word.
PSA.119.170	May my supplication come before you;
PSA.119.170	deliver me according to your promise.
PSA.119.171	May my lips overflow with praise,
PSA.119.171	for you teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.172	May my tongue sing of your word,
PSA.119.172	for all your commands are righteous.
PSA.119.173	May your hand be ready to help me,
PSA.119.173	for I have chosen your precepts.
PSA.119.174	I long for your salvation, 
PSA.119.174	and your law gives me delight.
PSA.119.175	Let me live that I may praise you,
PSA.119.175	and may your laws sustain me.
PSA.119.176	I have strayed like a lost sheep.
PSA.119.176	Seek your servant,
PSA.119.176	for I have not forgotten your commands.
PSA.120.1	I call on the 
PSA.120.1	and he answers me.
PSA.120.2	Save me, 
PSA.120.2	from lying lips
PSA.120.2	and from deceitful tongues.
PSA.120.3	What will he do to you,
PSA.120.3	and what more besides,
PSA.120.3	you deceitful tongue?
PSA.120.4	He will punish you with a warrior’s sharp arrows,
PSA.120.4	with burning coals of the broom bush.
PSA.120.5	Woe to me that I dwell in Meshek,
PSA.120.5	that I live among the tents of Kedar!
PSA.120.6	Too long have I lived
PSA.120.6	among those who hate peace.
PSA.120.7	I am for peace;
PSA.120.7	but when I speak, they are for war.
PSA.121.1	I lift up my eyes to the mountains—
PSA.121.1	where does my help come from?
PSA.121.2	My help comes from the 
PSA.121.2	the Maker of heaven and earth.
PSA.121.3	He will not let your foot slip—
PSA.121.3	he who watches over you will not slumber;
PSA.121.4	indeed, he who watches over Israel
PSA.121.4	will neither slumber nor sleep.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.5	the 
PSA.121.6	the sun will not harm you by day,
PSA.121.6	nor the moon by night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.7	he will watch over your life;
PSA.121.8	the 
PSA.121.8	both now and forevermore.
PSA.122.1	I rejoiced with those who said to me,
PSA.122.1	“Let us go to the house of the 
PSA.122.2	Our feet are standing
PSA.122.2	in your gates, Jerusalem.
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem is built like a city
PSA.122.3	that is closely compacted together.
PSA.122.4	That is where the tribes go up—
PSA.122.4	the tribes of the 
PSA.122.4	to praise the name of the 
PSA.122.4	according to the statute given to Israel.
PSA.122.5	There stand the thrones for judgment,
PSA.122.5	the thrones of the house of David.
PSA.122.6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
PSA.122.6	“May those who love you be secure.
PSA.122.7	May there be peace within your walls
PSA.122.7	and security within your citadels.”
PSA.122.8	For the sake of my family and friends,
PSA.122.8	I will say, “Peace be within you.”
PSA.122.9	For the sake of the house of the 
PSA.122.9	I will seek your prosperity.
PSA.123.1	I lift up my eyes to you,
PSA.123.1	to you who sit enthroned in heaven.
PSA.123.2	As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master,
PSA.123.2	as the eyes of a female slave look to the hand of her mistress,
PSA.123.2	so our eyes look to the 
PSA.123.2	till he shows us his mercy.
PSA.123.3	Have mercy on us, 
PSA.123.3	for we have endured no end of contempt.
PSA.123.4	We have endured no end
PSA.123.4	of ridicule from the arrogant,
PSA.123.4	of contempt from the proud.
PSA.124.1	If the 
PSA.124.1	let Israel say—
PSA.124.2	if the 
PSA.124.2	when people attacked us,
PSA.124.3	they would have swallowed us alive
PSA.124.3	when their anger flared against us;
PSA.124.4	the flood would have engulfed us,
PSA.124.4	the torrent would have swept over us,
PSA.124.5	the raging waters
PSA.124.5	would have swept us away.
PSA.124.6	Praise be to the 
PSA.124.6	who has not let us be torn by their teeth.
PSA.124.7	We have escaped like a bird
PSA.124.7	from the fowler’s snare;
PSA.124.7	the snare has been broken,
PSA.124.7	and we have escaped.
PSA.124.8	Our help is in the name of the 
PSA.124.8	the Maker of heaven and earth.
PSA.125.1	Those who trust in the 
PSA.125.1	which cannot be shaken but endures forever.
PSA.125.2	As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
PSA.125.2	so the 
PSA.125.2	both now and forevermore.
PSA.125.3	The scepter of the wicked will not remain
PSA.125.3	over the land allotted to the righteous,
PSA.125.3	for then the righteous might use
PSA.125.3	their hands to do evil.
PSA.125.4	to those who are upright in heart.
PSA.125.5	But those who turn to crooked ways
PSA.125.5	the 
PSA.125.5	Peace be on Israel.
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.1	we were like those who dreamed.
PSA.126.2	Our mouths were filled with laughter,
PSA.126.2	our tongues with songs of joy.
PSA.126.2	Then it was said among the nations,
PSA.126.2	“The 
PSA.126.3	The 
PSA.126.3	and we are filled with joy.
PSA.126.4	Restore our fortunes,
PSA.126.4	like streams in the Negev.
PSA.126.5	Those who sow with tears
PSA.126.5	will reap with songs of joy.
PSA.126.6	Those who go out weeping,
PSA.126.6	carrying seed to sow,
PSA.126.6	will return with songs of joy,
PSA.126.6	carrying sheaves with them.
PSA.127.1	Unless the 
PSA.127.1	the builders labor in vain.
PSA.127.1	Unless the 
PSA.127.1	the guards stand watch in vain.
PSA.127.2	In vain you rise early
PSA.127.2	and stay up late,
PSA.127.2	toiling for food to eat—
PSA.127.2	for he grants sleep to
PSA.127.3	Children are a heritage from the 
PSA.127.3	offspring a reward from him.
PSA.127.4	Like arrows in the hands of a warrior
PSA.127.4	are children born in one’s youth.
PSA.127.5	Blessed is the man
PSA.127.5	whose quiver is full of them.
PSA.127.5	They will not be put to shame
PSA.127.5	when they contend with their opponents in court.
PSA.128.1	Blessed are all who fear the 
PSA.128.1	who walk in obedience to him.
PSA.128.2	You will eat the fruit of your labor;
PSA.128.2	blessings and prosperity will be yours.
PSA.128.3	Your wife will be like a fruitful vine
PSA.128.3	within your house;
PSA.128.3	your children will be like olive shoots
PSA.128.3	around your table.
PSA.128.4	Yes, this will be the blessing
PSA.128.4	for the man who fears the 
PSA.128.5	May the 
PSA.128.5	may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem
PSA.128.5	all the days of your life.
PSA.128.6	May you live to see your children’s children—
PSA.128.6	peace be on Israel.
PSA.129.1	“They have greatly oppressed me from my youth,”
PSA.129.1	let Israel say;
PSA.129.2	“they have greatly oppressed me from my youth,
PSA.129.2	but they have not gained the victory over me.
PSA.129.3	Plowmen have plowed my back
PSA.129.3	and made their furrows long.
PSA.129.4	But the 
PSA.129.4	he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.”
PSA.129.5	May all who hate Zion
PSA.129.5	be turned back in shame.
PSA.129.6	May they be like grass on the roof,
PSA.129.6	which withers before it can grow;
PSA.129.7	a reaper cannot fill his hands with it,
PSA.129.7	nor one who gathers fill his arms.
PSA.129.8	May those who pass by not say to them,
PSA.129.8	“The blessing of the 
PSA.129.8	we bless you in the name of the 
PSA.130.1	Out of the depths I cry to you, 
PSA.130.2	Lord, hear my voice.
PSA.130.2	Let your ears be attentive
PSA.130.2	to my cry for mercy.
PSA.130.3	If you, 
PSA.130.3	Lord, who could stand?
PSA.130.4	But with you there is forgiveness,
PSA.130.4	so that we can, with reverence, serve you.
PSA.130.5	I wait for the 
PSA.130.5	and in his word I put my hope.
PSA.130.6	I wait for the Lord
PSA.130.6	more than watchmen wait for the morning,
PSA.130.6	more than watchmen wait for the morning.
PSA.130.7	Israel, put your hope in the 
PSA.130.7	for with the 
PSA.130.7	and with him is full redemption.
PSA.130.8	He himself will redeem Israel
PSA.130.8	from all their sins.
PSA.131.1	My heart is not proud, 
PSA.131.1	my eyes are not haughty;
PSA.131.1	I do not concern myself with great matters
PSA.131.1	or things too wonderful for me.
PSA.131.2	But I have calmed and quieted myself,
PSA.131.2	I am like a weaned child with its mother;
PSA.131.2	like a weaned child I am content.
PSA.131.3	Israel, put your hope in the 
PSA.131.3	both now and forevermore.
PSA.132.1	and all his self-denial.
PSA.132.2	He swore an oath to the 
PSA.132.2	he made a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:
PSA.132.3	“I will not enter my house
PSA.132.3	or go to my bed,
PSA.132.4	I will allow no sleep to my eyes
PSA.132.4	or slumber to my eyelids,
PSA.132.5	till I find a place for the 
PSA.132.5	a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
PSA.132.6	We heard it in Ephrathah,
PSA.132.6	we came upon it in the fields of Jaar:
PSA.132.7	“Let us go to his dwelling place,
PSA.132.7	let us worship at his footstool, saying,
PSA.132.8	‘Arise, 
PSA.132.8	you and the ark of your might.
PSA.132.9	May your priests be clothed with your righteousness;
PSA.132.9	may your faithful people sing for joy.’ ”
PSA.132.10	For the sake of your servant David,
PSA.132.10	do not reject your anointed one.
PSA.132.11	The 
PSA.132.11	a sure oath he will not revoke:
PSA.132.11	“One of your own descendants
PSA.132.11	I will place on your throne.
PSA.132.12	If your sons keep my covenant
PSA.132.12	and the statutes I teach them,
PSA.132.12	then their sons will sit
PSA.132.12	on your throne for ever and ever.”
PSA.132.13	For the 
PSA.132.13	he has desired it for his dwelling, saying,
PSA.132.14	“This is my resting place for ever and ever;
PSA.132.14	here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it.
PSA.132.15	I will bless her with abundant provisions;
PSA.132.15	her poor I will satisfy with food.
PSA.132.16	I will clothe her priests with salvation,
PSA.132.16	and her faithful people will ever sing for joy.
PSA.132.17	“Here I will make a horn
PSA.132.17	and set up a lamp for my anointed one.
PSA.132.18	I will clothe his enemies with shame,
PSA.132.18	but his head will be adorned with a radiant crown.”
PSA.133.1	How good and pleasant it is
PSA.133.1	when God’s people live together in unity!
PSA.133.2	It is like precious oil poured on the head,
PSA.133.2	running down on the beard,
PSA.133.2	running down on Aaron’s beard,
PSA.133.2	down on the collar of his robe.
PSA.133.3	It is as if the dew of Hermon
PSA.133.3	were falling on Mount Zion.
PSA.133.3	For there the 
PSA.133.3	even life forevermore.
PSA.134.1	Praise the 
PSA.134.1	who minister by night in the house of the

PSA.135.7	He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth;
PSA.135.7	he sends lightning with the rain
PSA.135.7	and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
PSA.135.8	He struck down the firstborn of Egypt,
PSA.135.8	the firstborn of people and animals.
PSA.135.9	He sent his signs and wonders into your midst, Egypt,
PSA.135.9	against Pharaoh and all his servants.
PSA.135.10	He struck down many nations
PSA.135.10	and killed mighty kings—
PSA.135.11	Sihon king of the Amorites,
PSA.135.11	Og king of Bashan,
PSA.135.11	and all the kings of Canaan—
PSA.135.12	and he gave their land as an inheritance,
PSA.135.12	an inheritance to his people Israel.

PSA.135.13	your renown, 
PSA.135.14	For the

PSA.135.15	The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
PSA.135.15	made by human hands.
PSA.135.16	They have mouths, but cannot speak,
PSA.135.16	eyes, but cannot see.
PSA.135.17	They have ears, but cannot hear,
PSA.135.17	nor is there breath in their mouths.
PSA.135.18	Those who make them will be like them,
PSA.135.18	and so will all who trust in them.
PSA.135.19	All you Israelites, praise the 
PSA.135.19	house of Aaron, praise the 
PSA.135.20	house of Levi, praise the

PSA.137.1	By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept
PSA.137.1	when we remembered Zion.
PSA.137.2	There on the poplars
PSA.137.2	we hung our harps,
PSA.137.3	for there our captors asked us for songs,
PSA.137.3	our tormentors demanded songs of joy;
PSA.137.3	they said, “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”
PSA.137.4	How can we sing the songs of the 
PSA.137.4	while in a foreign land?
PSA.137.5	If I forget you, Jerusalem,
PSA.137.5	may my right hand forget its skill.
PSA.137.6	May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth
PSA.137.6	if I do not remember you,
PSA.137.6	if I do not consider Jerusalem
PSA.137.6	my highest joy.
PSA.137.7	Remember, 
PSA.137.7	on the day Jerusalem fell.
PSA.137.7	“Tear it down,” they cried,
PSA.137.7	“tear it down to its foundations!”
PSA.137.8	Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction,
PSA.137.8	happy is the one who repays you
PSA.137.8	according to what you have done to us.
PSA.137.9	Happy is the one who seizes your infants
PSA.137.9	and dashes them against the rocks.
PSA.138.1	I will praise you, 
PSA.138.1	before the “gods” I will sing your praise.
PSA.138.2	I will bow down toward your holy temple
PSA.138.2	and will praise your name
PSA.138.2	for your unfailing love and your faithfulness,
PSA.138.2	for you have so exalted your solemn decree
PSA.138.2	that it surpasses your fame.
PSA.138.3	When I called, you answered me;
PSA.138.3	you greatly emboldened me.
PSA.138.4	May all the kings of the earth praise you, 
PSA.138.4	when they hear what you have decreed.
PSA.138.5	May they sing of the ways of the 
PSA.138.5	for the glory of the 
PSA.138.6	Though the 
PSA.138.6	though lofty, he sees them from afar.
PSA.138.7	Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
PSA.138.7	you preserve my life.
PSA.138.7	You stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes;
PSA.138.7	with your right hand you save me.
PSA.138.8	The 
PSA.138.8	your love, 
PSA.138.8	do not abandon the works of your hands.
PSA.139.1	You have searched me, 
PSA.139.1	and you know me.
PSA.139.2	You know when I sit and when I rise;
PSA.139.2	you perceive my thoughts from afar.
PSA.139.3	You discern my going out and my lying down;
PSA.139.3	you are familiar with all my ways.
PSA.139.4	Before a word is on my tongue
PSA.139.4	you, 
PSA.139.5	You hem me in behind and before,
PSA.139.5	and you lay your hand upon me.
PSA.139.6	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
PSA.139.6	too lofty for me to attain.
PSA.139.7	Where can I go from your Spirit?
PSA.139.7	Where can I flee from your presence?
PSA.139.8	If I go up to the heavens, you are there;
PSA.139.8	if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.
PSA.139.9	If I rise on the wings of the dawn,
PSA.139.9	if I settle on the far side of the sea,
PSA.139.10	even there your hand will guide me,
PSA.139.10	your right hand will hold me fast.
PSA.139.11	If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me
PSA.139.11	and the light become night around me,”
PSA.139.12	even the darkness will not be dark to you;
PSA.139.12	the night will shine like the day,
PSA.139.12	for darkness is as light to you.
PSA.139.13	For you created my inmost being;
PSA.139.13	you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
PSA.139.14	I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
PSA.139.14	your works are wonderful,
PSA.139.14	I know that full well.
PSA.139.15	My frame was not hidden from you
PSA.139.15	when I was made in the secret place,
PSA.139.15	when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
PSA.139.16	Your eyes saw my unformed body;
PSA.139.16	all the days ordained for me were written in your book
PSA.139.16	before one of them came to be.
PSA.139.17	How precious to me are your thoughts,
PSA.139.17	How vast is the sum of them!
PSA.139.18	Were I to count them,
PSA.139.18	they would outnumber the grains of sand—
PSA.139.18	when I awake, I am still with you.
PSA.139.19	If only you, God, would slay the wicked!
PSA.139.19	Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty!
PSA.139.20	They speak of you with evil intent;
PSA.139.20	your adversaries misuse your name.
PSA.139.21	Do I not hate those who hate you, 
PSA.139.21	and abhor those who are in rebellion against you?
PSA.139.22	I have nothing but hatred for them;
PSA.139.22	I count them my enemies.
PSA.139.23	Search me, God, and know my heart;
PSA.139.23	test me and know my anxious thoughts.
PSA.139.24	See if there is any offensive way in me,
PSA.139.24	and lead me in the way everlasting.
PSA.140.1	Rescue me, 
PSA.140.1	protect me from the violent,
PSA.140.2	who devise evil plans in their hearts
PSA.140.2	and stir up war every day.
PSA.140.3	They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent’s;
PSA.140.3	the poison of vipers is on their lips.
PSA.140.4	Keep me safe, 
PSA.140.4	protect me from the violent,
PSA.140.4	who devise ways to trip my feet.
PSA.140.5	The arrogant have hidden a snare for me;
PSA.140.5	they have spread out the cords of their net
PSA.140.5	and have set traps for me along my path.
PSA.140.6	I say to the 
PSA.140.6	Hear, 
PSA.140.7	Sovereign 
PSA.140.7	you shield my head in the day of battle.
PSA.140.8	Do not grant the wicked their desires, 
PSA.140.8	do not let their plans succeed.
PSA.140.9	Those who surround me proudly rear their heads;
PSA.140.9	may the mischief of their lips engulf them.
PSA.140.10	May burning coals fall on them;
PSA.140.10	may they be thrown into the fire,
PSA.140.10	into miry pits, never to rise.
PSA.140.11	May slanderers not be established in the land;
PSA.140.11	may disaster hunt down the violent.
PSA.140.12	I know that the 
PSA.140.12	and upholds the cause of the needy.
PSA.140.13	Surely the righteous will praise your name,
PSA.140.13	and the upright will live in your presence.
PSA.141.1	I call to you, 
PSA.141.1	hear me when I call to you.
PSA.141.2	May my prayer be set before you like incense;
PSA.141.2	may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.
PSA.141.3	Set a guard over my mouth, 
PSA.141.3	keep watch over the door of my lips.
PSA.141.4	Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil
PSA.141.4	so that I take part in wicked deeds
PSA.141.4	along with those who are evildoers;
PSA.141.4	do not let me eat their delicacies.
PSA.141.5	Let a righteous man strike me—that is a kindness;
PSA.141.5	let him rebuke me—that is oil on my head.
PSA.141.5	My head will not refuse it,
PSA.141.5	for my prayer will still be against the deeds of evildoers.
PSA.141.6	Their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs,
PSA.141.6	and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.
PSA.141.7	They will say, “As one plows and breaks up the earth,
PSA.141.7	so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave.”
PSA.141.8	But my eyes are fixed on you, Sovereign 
PSA.141.8	in you I take refuge—do not give me over to death.
PSA.141.9	Keep me safe from the traps set by evildoers,
PSA.141.9	from the snares they have laid for me.
PSA.141.10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
PSA.141.10	while I pass by in safety.
PSA.142.1	I cry aloud to the 
PSA.142.1	I lift up my voice to the 
PSA.142.2	I pour out before him my complaint;
PSA.142.2	before him I tell my trouble.
PSA.142.3	When my spirit grows faint within me,
PSA.142.3	it is you who watch over my way.
PSA.142.3	In the path where I walk
PSA.142.3	people have hidden a snare for me.
PSA.142.4	Look and see, there is no one at my right hand;
PSA.142.4	no one is concerned for me.
PSA.142.4	I have no refuge;
PSA.142.4	no one cares for my life.
PSA.142.5	I cry to you, 
PSA.142.5	I say, “You are my refuge,
PSA.142.5	my portion in the land of the living.”
PSA.142.6	Listen to my cry,
PSA.142.6	for I am in desperate need;
PSA.142.6	rescue me from those who pursue me,
PSA.142.6	for they are too strong for me.
PSA.142.7	Set me free from my prison,
PSA.142.7	that I may praise your name.
PSA.142.7	Then the righteous will gather about me
PSA.142.7	because of your goodness to me.
PSA.143.1	listen to my cry for mercy;
PSA.143.1	in your faithfulness and righteousness
PSA.143.1	come to my relief.
PSA.143.2	Do not bring your servant into judgment,
PSA.143.2	for no one living is righteous before you.
PSA.143.3	The enemy pursues me,
PSA.143.3	he crushes me to the ground;
PSA.143.3	he makes me dwell in the darkness
PSA.143.3	like those long dead.
PSA.143.4	So my spirit grows faint within me;
PSA.143.4	my heart within me is dismayed.
PSA.143.5	I remember the days of long ago;
PSA.143.5	I meditate on all your works
PSA.143.5	and consider what your hands have done.
PSA.143.6	I spread out my hands to you;
PSA.143.6	I thirst for you like a parched land.
PSA.143.7	Answer me quickly, 
PSA.143.7	my spirit fails.
PSA.143.7	Do not hide your face from me
PSA.143.7	or I will be like those who go down to the pit.
PSA.143.8	Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love,
PSA.143.8	for I have put my trust in you.
PSA.143.8	Show me the way I should go,
PSA.143.8	for to you I entrust my life.
PSA.143.9	Rescue me from my enemies, 
PSA.143.9	for I hide myself in you.
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do your will,
PSA.143.10	for you are my God;
PSA.143.10	may your good Spirit
PSA.143.10	lead me on level ground.
PSA.143.11	For your name’s sake, 
PSA.143.11	in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.
PSA.143.12	In your unfailing love, silence my enemies;
PSA.143.12	destroy all my foes,
PSA.143.12	for I am your servant.
PSA.144.1	Praise be to the 
PSA.144.1	who trains my hands for war,
PSA.144.1	my fingers for battle.
PSA.144.2	He is my loving God and my fortress,
PSA.144.2	my stronghold and my deliverer,
PSA.144.2	my shield, in whom I take refuge,
PSA.144.2	who subdues peoples
PSA.144.3	mere mortals that you think of them?
PSA.144.4	They are like a breath;
PSA.144.4	their days are like a fleeting shadow.
PSA.144.5	Part your heavens, 
PSA.144.5	touch the mountains, so that they smoke.
PSA.144.6	Send forth lightning and scatter the enemy;
PSA.144.6	shoot your arrows and rout them.
PSA.144.7	Reach down your hand from on high;
PSA.144.7	deliver me and rescue me
PSA.144.7	from the mighty waters,
PSA.144.7	from the hands of foreigners
PSA.144.8	whose mouths are full of lies,
PSA.144.8	whose right hands are deceitful.
PSA.144.9	I will sing a new song to you, my God;
PSA.144.9	on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you,
PSA.144.10	to the One who gives victory to kings,
PSA.144.10	who delivers his servant David.
PSA.144.10	From the deadly sword 
PSA.144.11	deliver me;
PSA.144.11	rescue me from the hands of foreigners
PSA.144.11	whose mouths are full of lies,
PSA.144.11	whose right hands are deceitful.
PSA.144.12	Then our sons in their youth
PSA.144.12	will be like well-nurtured plants,
PSA.144.12	and our daughters will be like pillars
PSA.144.12	carved to adorn a palace.
PSA.144.13	Our barns will be filled
PSA.144.13	with every kind of provision.
PSA.144.13	Our sheep will increase by thousands,
PSA.144.13	by tens of thousands in our fields;
PSA.144.14	our oxen will draw heavy loads.
PSA.144.14	There will be no breaching of walls,
PSA.144.14	no going into captivity,
PSA.144.14	no cry of distress in our streets.
PSA.144.15	Blessed is the people of whom this is true;
PSA.144.15	blessed is the people whose God is the 
PSA.145.1	I will exalt you, my God the King;

PSA.145.18	The

PSA.146.3	Do not put your trust in princes,
PSA.146.3	in human beings, who cannot save.
PSA.146.4	When their spirit departs, they return to the ground;
PSA.146.4	on that very day their plans come to nothing.
PSA.146.5	Blessed are those whose help is the God of Jacob,
PSA.146.5	whose hope is in the 
PSA.146.6	He is the Maker of heaven and earth,

PSA.147.2	he gathers the exiles of Israel.
PSA.147.3	He heals the brokenhearted
PSA.147.3	and binds up their wounds.
PSA.147.4	He determines the number of the stars
PSA.147.4	and calls them each by name.

PSA.147.9	and for the young ravens when they call.
PSA.147.10	His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse,
PSA.147.10	nor his delight in the legs of the warrior;

PSA.149.4	he crowns the humble with victory.
PSA.149.5	Let his faithful people rejoice in this honor
PSA.149.5	and sing for joy on their beds.
PSA.149.6	May the praise of God be in their mouths
PSA.149.6	and a double-edged sword in their hands,
PSA.149.7	to inflict vengeance on the nations
PSA.149.7	and punishment on the peoples,
PSA.149.8	to bind their kings with fetters,
PSA.149.8	their nobles with shackles of iron,
PSA.149.9	to carry out the sentence written against them—
PSA.149.9	this is the glory of all his faithful people.

PSA.150.5	praise him with the clash of cymbals,
PSA.150.5	praise him with resounding cymbals.
PSA.150.6	Let everything that has breath praise the 
PSA.150.6	Praise the 
PRO.1.1	The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
PRO.1.2	for gaining wisdom and instruction;
PRO.1.2	for understanding words of insight;
PRO.1.3	for receiving instruction in prudent behavior,
PRO.1.3	doing what is right and just and fair;
PRO.1.4	for giving prudence to those who are simple,
PRO.1.4	knowledge and discretion to the young—
PRO.1.5	let the wise listen and add to their learning,
PRO.1.5	and let the discerning get guidance—
PRO.1.6	for understanding proverbs and parables,
PRO.1.6	the sayings and riddles of the wise.
PRO.1.7	The fear of the 
PRO.1.7	but fools
PRO.1.8	Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction
PRO.1.8	and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
PRO.1.9	They are a garland to grace your head
PRO.1.9	and a chain to adorn your neck.
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinful men entice you,
PRO.1.10	do not give in to them.
PRO.1.11	If they say, “Come along with us;
PRO.1.11	let’s lie in wait for innocent blood,
PRO.1.11	let’s ambush some harmless soul;
PRO.1.12	let’s swallow them alive, like the grave,
PRO.1.12	and whole, like those who go down to the pit;
PRO.1.13	we will get all sorts of valuable things
PRO.1.13	and fill our houses with plunder;
PRO.1.14	cast lots with us;
PRO.1.14	we will all share the loot”—
PRO.1.15	my son, do not go along with them,
PRO.1.15	do not set foot on their paths;
PRO.1.16	for their feet rush into evil,
PRO.1.16	they are swift to shed blood.
PRO.1.17	How useless to spread a net
PRO.1.17	where every bird can see it!
PRO.1.18	These men lie in wait for their own blood;
PRO.1.18	they ambush only themselves!
PRO.1.19	Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain;
PRO.1.19	it takes away the life of those who get it.
PRO.1.20	Out in the open wisdom calls aloud,
PRO.1.20	she raises her voice in the public square;
PRO.1.21	on top of the wall
PRO.1.21	at the city gate she makes her speech:
PRO.1.22	“How long will you who are simple love your simple ways?
PRO.1.22	How long will mockers delight in mockery
PRO.1.22	and fools hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	Repent at my rebuke!
PRO.1.23	Then I will pour out my thoughts to you,
PRO.1.23	I will make known to you my teachings.
PRO.1.24	But since you refuse to listen when I call
PRO.1.24	and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,
PRO.1.25	since you disregard all my advice
PRO.1.25	and do not accept my rebuke,
PRO.1.26	I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you;
PRO.1.26	I will mock when calamity overtakes you—
PRO.1.27	when calamity overtakes you like a storm,
PRO.1.27	when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,
PRO.1.27	when distress and trouble overwhelm you.
PRO.1.28	“Then they will call to me but I will not answer;
PRO.1.28	they will look for me but will not find me,
PRO.1.29	since they hated knowledge
PRO.1.29	and did not choose to fear the 
PRO.1.30	Since they would not accept my advice
PRO.1.30	and spurned my rebuke,
PRO.1.31	they will eat the fruit of their ways
PRO.1.31	and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
PRO.1.32	For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,
PRO.1.32	and the complacency of fools will destroy them;
PRO.1.33	but whoever listens to me will live in safety
PRO.1.33	and be at ease, without fear of harm.”
PRO.2.1	My son, if you accept my words
PRO.2.1	and store up my commands within you,
PRO.2.2	turning your ear to wisdom
PRO.2.2	and applying your heart to understanding—
PRO.2.3	indeed, if you call out for insight
PRO.2.3	and cry aloud for understanding,
PRO.2.4	and if you look for it as for silver
PRO.2.4	and search for it as for hidden treasure,
PRO.2.5	then you will understand the fear of the 
PRO.2.5	and find the knowledge of God.
PRO.2.6	For the 
PRO.2.6	from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
PRO.2.7	He holds success in store for the upright,
PRO.2.7	he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,
PRO.2.8	for he guards the course of the just
PRO.2.8	and protects the way of his faithful ones.
PRO.2.9	Then you will understand what is right and just
PRO.2.9	and fair—every good path.
PRO.2.10	For wisdom will enter your heart,
PRO.2.10	and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
PRO.2.11	Discretion will protect you,
PRO.2.11	and understanding will guard you.
PRO.2.12	Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men,
PRO.2.12	from men whose words are perverse,
PRO.2.13	who have left the straight paths
PRO.2.13	to walk in dark ways,
PRO.2.14	who delight in doing wrong
PRO.2.14	and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,
PRO.2.15	whose paths are crooked
PRO.2.15	and who are devious in their ways.
PRO.2.16	Wisdom will save you also from the adulterous woman,
PRO.2.16	from the wayward woman with her seductive words,
PRO.2.17	who has left the partner of her youth
PRO.2.17	and ignored the covenant she made before God.
PRO.2.18	Surely her house leads down to death
PRO.2.18	and her paths to the spirits of the dead.
PRO.2.19	None who go to her return
PRO.2.19	or attain the paths of life.
PRO.2.20	Thus you will walk in the ways of the good
PRO.2.20	and keep to the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For the upright will live in the land,
PRO.2.21	and the blameless will remain in it;
PRO.2.22	but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
PRO.2.22	and the unfaithful will be torn from it.
PRO.3.1	My son, do not forget my teaching,
PRO.3.1	but keep my commands in your heart,
PRO.3.2	for they will prolong your life many years
PRO.3.2	and bring you peace and prosperity.
PRO.3.3	Let love and faithfulness never leave you;
PRO.3.3	bind them around your neck,
PRO.3.3	write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.3.4	Then you will win favor and a good name
PRO.3.4	in the sight of God and man.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the 
PRO.3.5	and lean not on your own understanding;
PRO.3.6	in all your ways submit to him,
PRO.3.6	and he will make your paths straight.
PRO.3.7	Do not be wise in your own eyes;
PRO.3.7	fear the 
PRO.3.8	This will bring health to your body
PRO.3.8	and nourishment to your bones.
PRO.3.9	Honor the 
PRO.3.9	with the firstfruits of all your crops;
PRO.3.10	then your barns will be filled to overflowing,
PRO.3.10	and your vats will brim over with new wine.
PRO.3.11	My son, do not despise the 
PRO.3.11	and do not resent his rebuke,
PRO.3.12	because the 
PRO.3.12	as a father the son he delights in.
PRO.3.13	Blessed are those who find wisdom,
PRO.3.13	those who gain understanding,
PRO.3.14	for she is more profitable than silver
PRO.3.14	and yields better returns than gold.
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than rubies;
PRO.3.15	nothing you desire can compare with her.
PRO.3.16	Long life is in her right hand;
PRO.3.16	in her left hand are riches and honor.
PRO.3.17	Her ways are pleasant ways,
PRO.3.17	and all her paths are peace.
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her;
PRO.3.18	those who hold her fast will be blessed.
PRO.3.19	By wisdom the 
PRO.3.19	by understanding he set the heavens in place;
PRO.3.20	by his knowledge the watery depths were divided,
PRO.3.20	and the clouds let drop the dew.
PRO.3.21	My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight,
PRO.3.21	preserve sound judgment and discretion;
PRO.3.22	they will be life for you,
PRO.3.22	an ornament to grace your neck.
PRO.3.23	Then you will go on your way in safety,
PRO.3.23	and your foot will not stumble.
PRO.3.24	When you lie down, you will not be afraid;
PRO.3.24	when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
PRO.3.25	Have no fear of sudden disaster
PRO.3.25	or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,
PRO.3.26	for the 
PRO.3.26	and will keep your foot from being snared.
PRO.3.27	Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
PRO.3.27	when it is in your power to act.
PRO.3.28	Do not say to your neighbor,
PRO.3.28	“Come back tomorrow and I’ll give it to you”—
PRO.3.28	when you already have it with you.
PRO.3.29	Do not plot harm against your neighbor,
PRO.3.29	who lives trustfully near you.
PRO.3.30	Do not accuse anyone for no reason—
PRO.3.30	when they have done you no harm.
PRO.3.31	Do not envy the violent
PRO.3.31	or choose any of their ways.
PRO.3.32	For the 
PRO.3.32	but takes the upright into his confidence.
PRO.3.33	The 
PRO.3.33	but he blesses the home of the righteous.
PRO.3.34	He mocks proud mockers
PRO.3.34	but shows favor to the humble and oppressed.
PRO.3.35	The wise inherit honor,
PRO.3.35	but fools get only shame.
PRO.4.1	Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction;
PRO.4.1	pay attention and gain understanding.
PRO.4.2	I give you sound learning,
PRO.4.2	so do not forsake my teaching.
PRO.4.3	For I too was a son to my father,
PRO.4.3	still tender, and cherished by my mother.
PRO.4.4	Then he taught me, and he said to me,
PRO.4.4	“Take hold of my words with all your heart;
PRO.4.4	keep my commands, and you will live.
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom, get understanding;
PRO.4.5	do not forget my words or turn away from them.
PRO.4.6	Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you;
PRO.4.6	love her, and she will watch over you.
PRO.4.7	The beginning of wisdom is this: Get
PRO.4.7	Though it cost all you have,
PRO.4.8	Cherish her, and she will exalt you;
PRO.4.8	embrace her, and she will honor you.
PRO.4.9	She will give you a garland to grace your head
PRO.4.9	and present you with a glorious crown.”
PRO.4.10	Listen, my son, accept what I say,
PRO.4.10	and the years of your life will be many.
PRO.4.11	I instruct you in the way of wisdom
PRO.4.11	and lead you along straight paths.
PRO.4.12	When you walk, your steps will not be hampered;
PRO.4.12	when you run, you will not stumble.
PRO.4.13	Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;
PRO.4.13	guard it well, for it is your life.
PRO.4.14	Do not set foot on the path of the wicked
PRO.4.14	or walk in the way of evildoers.
PRO.4.15	Avoid it, do not travel on it;
PRO.4.15	turn from it and go on your way.
PRO.4.16	For they cannot rest until they do evil;
PRO.4.16	they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble.
PRO.4.17	They eat the bread of wickedness
PRO.4.17	and drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	The path of the righteous is like the morning sun,
PRO.4.18	shining ever brighter till the full light of day.
PRO.4.19	But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness;
PRO.4.19	they do not know what makes them stumble.
PRO.4.20	My son, pay attention to what I say;
PRO.4.20	turn your ear to my words.
PRO.4.21	Do not let them out of your sight,
PRO.4.21	keep them within your heart;
PRO.4.22	for they are life to those who find them
PRO.4.22	and health to one’s whole body.
PRO.4.23	Above all else, guard your heart,
PRO.4.23	for everything you do flows from it.
PRO.4.24	Keep your mouth free of perversity;
PRO.4.24	keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
PRO.4.25	Let your eyes look straight ahead;
PRO.4.25	fix your gaze directly before you.
PRO.4.26	Give careful thought to the
PRO.4.26	and be steadfast in all your ways.
PRO.4.27	Do not turn to the right or the left;
PRO.4.27	keep your foot from evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, pay attention to my wisdom,
PRO.5.1	turn your ear to my words of insight,
PRO.5.2	that you may maintain discretion
PRO.5.2	and your lips may preserve knowledge.
PRO.5.3	For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,
PRO.5.3	and her speech is smoother than oil;
PRO.5.4	but in the end she is bitter as gall,
PRO.5.4	sharp as a double-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death;
PRO.5.5	her steps lead straight to the grave.
PRO.5.6	She gives no thought to the way of life;
PRO.5.6	her paths wander aimlessly, but she does not know it.
PRO.5.7	Now then, my sons, listen to me;
PRO.5.7	do not turn aside from what I say.
PRO.5.8	Keep to a path far from her,
PRO.5.8	do not go near the door of her house,
PRO.5.9	lest you lose your honor to others
PRO.5.9	and your dignity
PRO.5.10	lest strangers feast on your wealth
PRO.5.10	and your toil enrich the house of another.
PRO.5.11	At the end of your life you will groan,
PRO.5.11	when your flesh and body are spent.
PRO.5.12	You will say, “How I hated discipline!
PRO.5.12	How my heart spurned correction!
PRO.5.13	I would not obey my teachers
PRO.5.13	or turn my ear to my instructors.
PRO.5.14	And I was soon in serious trouble
PRO.5.14	in the assembly of God’s people.”
PRO.5.15	Drink water from your own cistern,
PRO.5.15	running water from your own well.
PRO.5.16	Should your springs overflow in the streets,
PRO.5.16	your streams of water in the public squares?
PRO.5.17	Let them be yours alone,
PRO.5.17	never to be shared with strangers.
PRO.5.18	May your fountain be blessed,
PRO.5.18	and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.
PRO.5.19	A loving doe, a graceful deer—
PRO.5.19	may her breasts satisfy you always,
PRO.5.19	may you ever be intoxicated with her love.
PRO.5.20	Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife?
PRO.5.20	Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?
PRO.5.21	For your ways are in full view of the 
PRO.5.21	and he examines all your paths.
PRO.5.22	The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them;
PRO.5.22	the cords of their sins hold them fast.
PRO.5.23	For lack of discipline they will die,
PRO.5.23	led astray by their own great folly.
PRO.6.1	My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor,
PRO.6.1	if you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,
PRO.6.2	you have been trapped by what you said,
PRO.6.2	ensnared by the words of your mouth.
PRO.6.3	So do this, my son, to free yourself,
PRO.6.3	since you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands:
PRO.6.3	Go—to the point of exhaustion—
PRO.6.3	and give your neighbor no rest!
PRO.6.4	Allow no sleep to your eyes,
PRO.6.4	no slumber to your eyelids.
PRO.6.5	Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
PRO.6.5	like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, you sluggard;
PRO.6.6	consider its ways and be wise!
PRO.6.7	It has no commander,
PRO.6.7	no overseer or ruler,
PRO.6.8	yet it stores its provisions in summer
PRO.6.8	and gathers its food at harvest.
PRO.6.9	How long will you lie there, you sluggard?
PRO.6.9	When will you get up from your sleep?
PRO.6.10	A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.6.10	a little folding of the hands to rest—
PRO.6.11	and poverty will come on you like a thief
PRO.6.11	and scarcity like an armed man.
PRO.6.12	A troublemaker and a villain,
PRO.6.12	who goes about with a corrupt mouth,
PRO.6.13	who winks maliciously with his eye,
PRO.6.13	signals with his feet
PRO.6.13	and motions with his fingers,
PRO.6.14	who plots evil with deceit in his heart—
PRO.6.14	he always stirs up conflict.
PRO.6.15	Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant;
PRO.6.15	he will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.
PRO.6.16	There are six things the 
PRO.6.16	seven that are detestable to him:
PRO.6.17	haughty eyes,
PRO.6.17	a lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	a heart that devises wicked schemes,
PRO.6.18	feet that are quick to rush into evil,
PRO.6.19	a false witness who pours out lies
PRO.6.19	and a person who stirs up conflict in the community.
PRO.6.20	My son, keep your father’s command
PRO.6.20	and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
PRO.6.21	Bind them always on your heart;
PRO.6.21	fasten them around your neck.
PRO.6.22	When you walk, they will guide you;
PRO.6.22	when you sleep, they will watch over you;
PRO.6.22	when you awake, they will speak to you.
PRO.6.23	For this command is a lamp,
PRO.6.23	this teaching is a light,
PRO.6.23	and correction and instruction
PRO.6.23	are the way to life,
PRO.6.24	keeping you from your neighbor’s wife,
PRO.6.24	from the smooth talk of a wayward woman.
PRO.6.25	Do not lust in your heart after her beauty
PRO.6.25	or let her captivate you with her eyes.
PRO.6.26	For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread,
PRO.6.26	but another man’s wife preys on your very life.
PRO.6.27	Can a man scoop fire into his lap
PRO.6.27	without his clothes being burned?
PRO.6.28	Can a man walk on hot coals
PRO.6.28	without his feet being scorched?
PRO.6.29	So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife;
PRO.6.29	no one who touches her will go unpunished.
PRO.6.30	People do not despise a thief if he steals
PRO.6.30	to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.
PRO.6.31	Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold,
PRO.6.31	though it costs him all the wealth of his house.
PRO.6.32	But a man who commits adultery has no sense;
PRO.6.32	whoever does so destroys himself.
PRO.6.33	Blows and disgrace are his lot,
PRO.6.33	and his shame will never be wiped away.
PRO.6.34	For jealousy arouses a husband’s fury,
PRO.6.34	and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
PRO.6.35	He will not accept any compensation;
PRO.6.35	he will refuse a bribe, however great it is.
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words
PRO.7.1	and store up my commands within you.
PRO.7.2	Keep my commands and you will live;
PRO.7.2	guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.
PRO.7.3	Bind them on your fingers;
PRO.7.3	write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.7.4	Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
PRO.7.4	and to insight, “You are my relative.”
PRO.7.5	They will keep you from the adulterous woman,
PRO.7.5	from the wayward woman with her seductive words.
PRO.7.6	At the window of my house
PRO.7.6	I looked down through the lattice.
PRO.7.7	I saw among the simple,
PRO.7.7	I noticed among the young men,
PRO.7.7	a youth who had no sense.
PRO.7.8	He was going down the street near her corner,
PRO.7.8	walking along in the direction of her house
PRO.7.9	at twilight, as the day was fading,
PRO.7.9	as the dark of night set in.
PRO.7.10	Then out came a woman to meet him,
PRO.7.10	dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.
PRO.7.11	(She is unruly and defiant,
PRO.7.11	her feet never stay at home;
PRO.7.12	now in the street, now in the squares,
PRO.7.12	at every corner she lurks.)
PRO.7.13	She took hold of him and kissed him
PRO.7.13	and with a brazen face she said:
PRO.7.14	“Today I fulfilled my vows,
PRO.7.14	and I have food from my fellowship offering at home.
PRO.7.15	So I came out to meet you;
PRO.7.15	I looked for you and have found you!
PRO.7.16	I have covered my bed
PRO.7.16	with colored linens from Egypt.
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed
PRO.7.17	with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let’s drink deeply of love till morning;
PRO.7.18	let’s enjoy ourselves with love!
PRO.7.19	My husband is not at home;
PRO.7.19	he has gone on a long journey.
PRO.7.20	He took his purse filled with money
PRO.7.20	and will not be home till full moon.”
PRO.7.21	With persuasive words she led him astray;
PRO.7.21	she seduced him with her smooth talk.
PRO.7.22	All at once he followed her
PRO.7.22	like an ox going to the slaughter,
PRO.7.22	like a deer
PRO.7.23	till an arrow pierces his liver,
PRO.7.23	like a bird darting into a snare,
PRO.7.23	little knowing it will cost him his life.
PRO.7.24	Now then, my sons, listen to me;
PRO.7.24	pay attention to what I say.
PRO.7.25	Do not let your heart turn to her ways
PRO.7.25	or stray into her paths.
PRO.7.26	Many are the victims she has brought down;
PRO.7.26	her slain are a mighty throng.
PRO.7.27	Her house is a highway to the grave,
PRO.7.27	leading down to the chambers of death.
PRO.8.1	Does not wisdom call out?
PRO.8.1	Does not understanding raise her voice?
PRO.8.2	At the highest point along the way,
PRO.8.2	where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
PRO.8.3	beside the gate leading into the city,
PRO.8.3	at the entrance, she cries aloud:
PRO.8.4	“To you, O people, I call out;
PRO.8.4	I raise my voice to all mankind.
PRO.8.5	You who are simple, gain prudence;
PRO.8.5	you who are foolish, set your hearts on it.
PRO.8.6	Listen, for I have trustworthy things to say;
PRO.8.6	I open my lips to speak what is right.
PRO.8.7	My mouth speaks what is true,
PRO.8.7	for my lips detest wickedness.
PRO.8.8	All the words of my mouth are just;
PRO.8.8	none of them is crooked or perverse.
PRO.8.9	To the discerning all of them are right;
PRO.8.9	they are upright to those who have found knowledge.
PRO.8.10	Choose my instruction instead of silver,
PRO.8.10	knowledge rather than choice gold,
PRO.8.11	for wisdom is more precious than rubies,
PRO.8.11	and nothing you desire can compare with her.
PRO.8.12	“I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence;
PRO.8.12	I possess knowledge and discretion.
PRO.8.13	To fear the 
PRO.8.13	I hate pride and arrogance,
PRO.8.13	evil behavior and perverse speech.
PRO.8.14	Counsel and sound judgment are mine;
PRO.8.14	I have insight, I have power.
PRO.8.15	By me kings reign
PRO.8.15	and rulers issue decrees that are just;
PRO.8.16	by me princes govern,
PRO.8.16	and nobles—all who rule on earth.
PRO.8.17	I love those who love me,
PRO.8.17	and those who seek me find me.
PRO.8.18	With me are riches and honor,
PRO.8.18	enduring wealth and prosperity.
PRO.8.19	My fruit is better than fine gold;
PRO.8.19	what I yield surpasses choice silver.
PRO.8.20	I walk in the way of righteousness,
PRO.8.20	along the paths of justice,
PRO.8.21	bestowing a rich inheritance on those who love me
PRO.8.21	and making their treasuries full.
PRO.8.22	“The 
PRO.8.22	before his deeds of old;
PRO.8.23	I was formed long ages ago,
PRO.8.23	at the very beginning, when the world came to be.
PRO.8.24	When there were no watery depths, I was given birth,
PRO.8.24	when there were no springs overflowing with water;
PRO.8.25	before the mountains were settled in place,
PRO.8.25	before the hills, I was given birth,
PRO.8.26	before he made the world or its fields
PRO.8.26	or any of the dust of the earth.
PRO.8.27	I was there when he set the heavens in place,
PRO.8.27	when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,
PRO.8.28	when he established the clouds above
PRO.8.28	and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,
PRO.8.29	when he gave the sea its boundary
PRO.8.29	so the waters would not overstep his command,
PRO.8.29	and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
PRO.8.30	Then I was constantly
PRO.8.30	I was filled with delight day after day,
PRO.8.30	rejoicing always in his presence,
PRO.8.31	rejoicing in his whole world
PRO.8.31	and delighting in mankind.
PRO.8.32	“Now then, my children, listen to me;
PRO.8.32	blessed are those who keep my ways.
PRO.8.33	Listen to my instruction and be wise;
PRO.8.33	do not disregard it.
PRO.8.34	Blessed are those who listen to me,
PRO.8.34	watching daily at my doors,
PRO.8.34	waiting at my doorway.
PRO.8.35	For those who find me find life
PRO.8.35	and receive favor from the 
PRO.8.36	But those who fail to find me harm themselves;
PRO.8.36	all who hate me love death.”
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her house;
PRO.9.1	she has set up
PRO.9.2	She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine;
PRO.9.2	she has also set her table.
PRO.9.3	She has sent out her servants, and she calls
PRO.9.3	from the highest point of the city,
PRO.9.4	“Let all who are simple come to my house!”
PRO.9.4	To those who have no sense she says,
PRO.9.5	“Come, eat my food
PRO.9.5	and drink the wine I have mixed.
PRO.9.6	Leave your simple ways and you will live;
PRO.9.6	walk in the way of insight.”
PRO.9.7	Whoever corrects a mocker invites insults;
PRO.9.7	whoever rebukes the wicked incurs abuse.
PRO.9.8	Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you;
PRO.9.8	rebuke the wise and they will love you.
PRO.9.9	Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still;
PRO.9.9	teach the righteous and they will add to their learning.
PRO.9.10	The fear of the 
PRO.9.10	and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
PRO.9.11	For through wisdom
PRO.9.11	and years will be added to your life.
PRO.9.12	If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you;
PRO.9.12	if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer.
PRO.9.13	Folly is an unruly woman;
PRO.9.13	she is simple and knows nothing.
PRO.9.14	She sits at the door of her house,
PRO.9.14	on a seat at the highest point of the city,
PRO.9.15	calling out to those who pass by,
PRO.9.15	who go straight on their way,
PRO.9.16	“Let all who are simple come to my house!”
PRO.9.16	To those who have no sense she says,
PRO.9.17	“Stolen water is sweet;
PRO.9.17	food eaten in secret is delicious!”
PRO.9.18	But little do they know that the dead are there,
PRO.9.18	that her guests are deep in the realm of the dead.

PRO.10.7	The name of the righteous is used in blessings,

PRO.10.13	but a rod is for the back of one who has no sense.
PRO.10.14	The wise store up knowledge,
PRO.10.14	but the mouth of a fool invites ruin.
PRO.10.15	The wealth of the rich is their fortified city,
PRO.10.15	but poverty is the ruin of the poor.
PRO.10.16	The wages of the righteous is life,
PRO.10.16	but the earnings of the wicked are sin and death.
PRO.10.17	Whoever heeds discipline shows the way to life,
PRO.10.17	but whoever ignores correction leads others astray.
PRO.10.18	Whoever conceals hatred with lying lips
PRO.10.18	and spreads slander is a fool.
PRO.10.19	Sin is not ended by multiplying words,
PRO.10.19	but the prudent hold their tongues.

PRO.10.24	what the righteous desire will be granted.
PRO.10.25	When the storm has swept by, the wicked are gone,
PRO.10.25	but the righteous stand firm forever.

PRO.11.10	when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy.
PRO.11.11	Through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,
PRO.11.11	but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed.
PRO.11.12	Whoever derides their neighbor has no sense,
PRO.11.12	but the one who has understanding holds their tongue.

PRO.18.11	they imagine it a wall too high to scale.
PRO.18.12	Before a downfall the heart is haughty,
PRO.18.12	but humility comes before honor.
PRO.18.13	To answer before listening—
PRO.18.13	that is folly and shame.

PRO.18.22	He who finds a wife finds what is good
PRO.18.22	and receives favor from the 
PRO.18.23	The poor plead for mercy,
PRO.18.23	but the rich answer harshly.
PRO.18.24	One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin,
PRO.18.24	but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
PRO.19.1	Better the poor whose walk is blameless
PRO.19.1	than a fool whose lips are perverse.
PRO.19.2	Desire without knowledge is not good—
PRO.19.2	how much more will hasty feet miss the way!
PRO.19.3	A person’s own folly leads to their ruin,
PRO.19.3	yet their heart rages against the 
PRO.19.4	Wealth attracts many friends,
PRO.19.4	but even the closest friend of the poor person deserts them.

PRO.19.5	and whoever pours out lies will not go free.
PRO.19.6	Many curry favor with a ruler,
PRO.19.6	and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts.
PRO.19.7	The poor are shunned by all their relatives—
PRO.19.7	how much more do their friends avoid them!
PRO.19.7	Though the poor pursue them with pleading,
PRO.19.7	they are nowhere to be found.
PRO.19.8	The one who gets wisdom loves life;
PRO.19.8	the one who cherishes understanding will soon prosper.
PRO.19.9	A false witness will not go unpunished,
PRO.19.9	and whoever pours out lies will perish.
PRO.19.10	It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury—
PRO.19.10	how much worse for a slave to rule over princes!
PRO.19.11	A person’s wisdom yields patience;
PRO.19.11	it is to one’s glory to overlook an offense.
PRO.19.12	A king’s rage is like the roar of a lion,
PRO.19.12	but his favor is like dew on the grass.
PRO.19.13	A foolish child is a father’s ruin,
PRO.19.13	and a quarrelsome wife is like
PRO.19.13	the constant dripping of a leaky roof.
PRO.19.14	Houses and wealth are inherited from parents,
PRO.19.14	but a prudent wife is from the 
PRO.19.15	Laziness brings on deep sleep,
PRO.19.15	and the shiftless go hungry.
PRO.19.16	Whoever keeps commandments keeps their life,
PRO.19.16	but whoever shows contempt for their ways will die.
PRO.19.17	Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the 
PRO.19.17	and he will reward them for what they have done.
PRO.19.18	Discipline your children, for in that there is hope;
PRO.19.18	do not be a willing party to their death.
PRO.19.19	A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty;
PRO.19.19	rescue them, and you will have to do it again.

PRO.19.25	rebuke the discerning, and they will gain knowledge.
PRO.19.26	Whoever robs their father and drives out their mother
PRO.19.26	is a child who brings shame and disgrace.
PRO.19.27	Stop listening to instruction, my son,
PRO.19.27	and you will stray from the words of knowledge.
PRO.19.28	A corrupt witness mocks at justice,
PRO.19.28	and the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil.
PRO.19.29	Penalties are prepared for mockers,
PRO.19.29	and beatings for the backs of fools.
PRO.20.1	Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler;
PRO.20.1	whoever is led astray by them is not wise.

PRO.20.8	he winnows out all evil with his eyes.
PRO.20.9	Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure;
PRO.20.9	I am clean and without sin”?
PRO.20.10	Differing weights and differing measures—
PRO.20.10	the 
PRO.20.11	Even small children are known by their actions,
PRO.20.11	so is their conduct really pure and upright?
PRO.20.12	Ears that hear and eyes that see—

PRO.20.14	then goes off and boasts about the purchase.
PRO.20.15	Gold there is, and rubies in abundance,
PRO.20.15	but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel.

PRO.20.16	hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider.
PRO.20.17	Food gained by fraud tastes sweet,
PRO.20.17	but one ends up with a mouth full of gravel.
PRO.20.18	Plans are established by seeking advice;
PRO.20.18	so if you wage war, obtain guidance.

PRO.20.20	their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness.
PRO.20.21	An inheritance claimed too soon
PRO.20.21	will not be blessed at the end.

PRO.21.5	The plans of the diligent lead to profit
PRO.21.5	as surely as haste leads to poverty.
PRO.21.6	A fortune made by a lying tongue
PRO.21.6	is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare.

PRO.21.8	but the conduct of the innocent is upright.
PRO.21.9	Better to live on a corner of the roof
PRO.21.9	than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
PRO.21.10	The wicked crave evil;
PRO.21.10	their neighbors get no mercy from them.
PRO.21.11	When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom;
PRO.21.11	by paying attention to the wise they get knowledge.
PRO.21.12	The Righteous One
PRO.21.12	and brings the wicked to ruin.
PRO.21.13	Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor
PRO.21.13	will also cry out and not be answered.
PRO.21.14	A gift given in secret soothes anger,
PRO.21.14	and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath.
PRO.21.15	When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous
PRO.21.15	but terror to evildoers.
PRO.21.16	Whoever strays from the path of prudence
PRO.21.16	comes to rest in the company of the dead.
PRO.21.17	Whoever loves pleasure will become poor;
PRO.21.17	whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich.
PRO.21.18	The wicked become a ransom for the righteous,
PRO.21.18	and the unfaithful for the upright.
PRO.21.19	Better to live in a desert
PRO.21.19	than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife.
PRO.21.20	The wise store up choice food and olive oil,
PRO.21.20	but fools gulp theirs down.
PRO.21.21	Whoever pursues righteousness and love
PRO.21.21	finds life, prosperity
PRO.21.22	One who is wise can go up against the city of the mighty
PRO.21.22	and pull down the stronghold in which they trust.
PRO.21.23	Those who guard their mouths and their tongues
PRO.21.23	keep themselves from calamity.
PRO.21.24	The proud and arrogant person—“Mocker” is his name—
PRO.21.24	behaves with insolent fury.
PRO.21.25	The craving of a sluggard will be the death of him,
PRO.21.25	because his hands refuse to work.
PRO.21.26	All day long he craves for more,
PRO.21.26	but the righteous give without sparing.
PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable—
PRO.21.27	how much more so when brought with evil intent!
PRO.21.28	A false witness will perish,
PRO.21.28	but a careful listener will testify successfully.
PRO.21.29	The wicked put up a bold front,
PRO.21.29	but the upright give thought to their ways.
PRO.21.30	There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan
PRO.21.30	that can succeed against the 
PRO.21.31	The horse is made ready for the day of battle,
PRO.21.31	but victory rests with the 
PRO.22.1	A good name is more desirable than great riches;
PRO.22.1	to be esteemed is better than silver or gold.
PRO.22.2	Rich and poor have this in common:
PRO.22.2	The 
PRO.22.3	The prudent see danger and take refuge,
PRO.22.3	but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.
PRO.22.4	Humility is the fear of the 
PRO.22.4	its wages are riches and honor and life.
PRO.22.5	In the paths of the wicked are snares and pitfalls,
PRO.22.5	but those who would preserve their life stay far from them.
PRO.22.6	Start children off on the way they should go,
PRO.22.6	and even when they are old they will not turn from it.
PRO.22.7	The rich rule over the poor,
PRO.22.7	and the borrower is slave to the lender.
PRO.22.8	Whoever sows injustice reaps calamity,
PRO.22.8	and the rod they wield in fury will be broken.
PRO.22.9	The generous will themselves be blessed,
PRO.22.9	for they share their food with the poor.
PRO.22.10	Drive out the mocker, and out goes strife;
PRO.22.10	quarrels and insults are ended.
PRO.22.11	One who loves a pure heart and who speaks with grace
PRO.22.11	will have the king for a friend.
PRO.22.12	The eyes of the 
PRO.22.12	but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.
PRO.22.13	The sluggard says, “There’s a lion outside!
PRO.22.13	I’ll be killed in the public square!”
PRO.22.14	The mouth of an adulterous woman is a deep pit;
PRO.22.14	a man who is under the 
PRO.22.15	Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,
PRO.22.15	but the rod of discipline will drive it far away.
PRO.22.16	One who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth
PRO.22.16	and one who gives gifts to the rich—both come to poverty.
PRO.22.17	Pay attention and turn your ear to the sayings of the wise;
PRO.22.17	apply your heart to what I teach,
PRO.22.18	for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart
PRO.22.18	and have all of them ready on your lips.
PRO.22.19	So that your trust may be in the 
PRO.22.19	I teach you today, even you.
PRO.22.20	Have I not written thirty sayings for you,
PRO.22.20	sayings of counsel and knowledge,
PRO.22.21	teaching you to be honest and to speak the truth,
PRO.22.21	so that you bring back truthful reports
PRO.22.21	to those you serve?
PRO.22.22	Do not exploit the poor because they are poor
PRO.22.22	and do not crush the needy in court,
PRO.22.23	for the 
PRO.22.23	and will exact life for life.
PRO.22.24	Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person,
PRO.22.24	do not associate with one easily angered,
PRO.22.25	or you may learn their ways
PRO.22.25	and get yourself ensnared.
PRO.22.26	Do not be one who shakes hands in pledge
PRO.22.26	or puts up security for debts;
PRO.22.27	if you lack the means to pay,
PRO.22.27	your very bed will be snatched from under you.
PRO.22.28	Do not move an ancient boundary stone
PRO.22.28	set up by your ancestors.
PRO.22.29	Do you see someone skilled in their work?
PRO.22.29	They will serve before kings;
PRO.22.29	they will not serve before officials of low rank.
PRO.23.1	When you sit to dine with a ruler,
PRO.23.1	note well what
PRO.23.2	and put a knife to your throat
PRO.23.2	if you are given to gluttony.
PRO.23.3	Do not crave his delicacies,
PRO.23.3	for that food is deceptive.
PRO.23.4	Do not wear yourself out to get rich;
PRO.23.4	do not trust your own cleverness.
PRO.23.5	Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone,
PRO.23.5	for they will surely sprout wings
PRO.23.5	and fly off to the sky like an eagle.
PRO.23.6	Do not eat the food of a begrudging host,
PRO.23.6	do not crave his delicacies;
PRO.23.7	for he is the kind of person
PRO.23.7	who is always thinking about the cost.
PRO.23.7	“Eat and drink,” he says to you,
PRO.23.7	but his heart is not with you.
PRO.23.8	You will vomit up the little you have eaten
PRO.23.8	and will have wasted your compliments.
PRO.23.9	Do not speak to fools,
PRO.23.9	for they will scorn your prudent words.
PRO.23.10	Do not move an ancient boundary stone
PRO.23.10	or encroach on the fields of the fatherless,
PRO.23.11	for their Defender is strong;
PRO.23.11	he will take up their case against you.
PRO.23.12	Apply your heart to instruction
PRO.23.12	and your ears to words of knowledge.
PRO.23.13	Do not withhold discipline from a child;
PRO.23.13	if you punish them with the rod, they will not die.
PRO.23.14	Punish them with the rod
PRO.23.14	and save them from death.
PRO.23.15	My son, if your heart is wise,
PRO.23.15	then my heart will be glad indeed;
PRO.23.16	my inmost being will rejoice
PRO.23.16	when your lips speak what is right.
PRO.23.17	Do not let your heart envy sinners,
PRO.23.17	but always be zealous for the fear of the 
PRO.23.18	There is surely a future hope for you,
PRO.23.18	and your hope will not be cut off.
PRO.23.19	Listen, my son, and be wise,
PRO.23.19	and set your heart on the right path:
PRO.23.20	Do not join those who drink too much wine
PRO.23.20	or gorge themselves on meat,
PRO.23.21	for drunkards and gluttons become poor,
PRO.23.21	and drowsiness clothes them in rags.
PRO.23.22	Listen to your father, who gave you life,
PRO.23.22	and do not despise your mother when she is old.
PRO.23.23	Buy the truth and do not sell it—
PRO.23.23	wisdom, instruction and insight as well.
PRO.23.24	The father of a righteous child has great joy;
PRO.23.24	a man who fathers a wise son rejoices in him.
PRO.23.25	May your father and mother rejoice;
PRO.23.25	may she who gave you birth be joyful!
PRO.23.26	My son, give me your heart
PRO.23.26	and let your eyes delight in my ways,
PRO.23.27	for an adulterous woman is a deep pit,
PRO.23.27	and a wayward wife is a narrow well.
PRO.23.28	Like a bandit she lies in wait
PRO.23.28	and multiplies the unfaithful among men.
PRO.23.29	Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
PRO.23.29	Who has strife? Who has complaints?
PRO.23.29	Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?
PRO.23.30	Those who linger over wine,
PRO.23.30	who go to sample bowls of mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Do not gaze at wine when it is red,
PRO.23.31	when it sparkles in the cup,
PRO.23.31	when it goes down smoothly!
PRO.23.32	In the end it bites like a snake
PRO.23.32	and poisons like a viper.
PRO.23.33	Your eyes will see strange sights,
PRO.23.33	and your mind will imagine confusing things.
PRO.23.34	You will be like one sleeping on the high seas,
PRO.23.34	lying on top of the rigging.
PRO.23.35	“They hit me,” you will say, “but I’m not hurt!
PRO.23.35	They beat me, but I don’t feel it!
PRO.23.35	When will I wake up
PRO.23.35	so I can find another drink?”
PRO.24.1	Do not envy the wicked,
PRO.24.1	do not desire their company;
PRO.24.2	for their hearts plot violence,
PRO.24.2	and their lips talk about making trouble.
PRO.24.3	By wisdom a house is built,
PRO.24.3	and through understanding it is established;
PRO.24.4	through knowledge its rooms are filled
PRO.24.4	with rare and beautiful treasures.
PRO.24.5	The wise prevail through great power,
PRO.24.5	and those who have knowledge muster their strength.
PRO.24.6	Surely you need guidance to wage war,
PRO.24.6	and victory is won through many advisers.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is too high for fools;
PRO.24.7	in the assembly at the gate they must not open their mouths.
PRO.24.8	Whoever plots evil
PRO.24.8	will be known as a schemer.
PRO.24.9	The schemes of folly are sin,
PRO.24.9	and people detest a mocker.
PRO.24.10	If you falter in a time of trouble,
PRO.24.10	how small is your strength!
PRO.24.11	Rescue those being led away to death;
PRO.24.11	hold back those staggering toward slaughter.
PRO.24.12	If you say, “But we knew nothing about this,”
PRO.24.12	does not he who weighs the heart perceive it?
PRO.24.12	Does not he who guards your life know it?
PRO.24.12	Will he not repay everyone according to what they have done?
PRO.24.13	Eat honey, my son, for it is good;
PRO.24.13	honey from the comb is sweet to your taste.
PRO.24.14	Know also that wisdom is like honey for you:
PRO.24.14	If you find it, there is a future hope for you,
PRO.24.14	and your hope will not be cut off.
PRO.24.15	Do not lurk like a thief near the house of the righteous,
PRO.24.15	do not plunder their dwelling place;
PRO.24.16	for though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again,
PRO.24.16	but the wicked stumble when calamity strikes.
PRO.24.17	Do not gloat when your enemy falls;
PRO.24.17	when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice,
PRO.24.18	or the 
PRO.24.18	and turn his wrath away from them.
PRO.24.19	Do not fret because of evildoers
PRO.24.19	or be envious of the wicked,
PRO.24.20	for the evildoer has no future hope,
PRO.24.20	and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.
PRO.24.21	Fear the 
PRO.24.21	and do not join with rebellious officials,
PRO.24.22	for those two will send sudden destruction on them,
PRO.24.22	and who knows what calamities they can bring?
PRO.24.23	These also are sayings of the wise:
PRO.24.23	To show partiality in judging is not good:
PRO.24.24	Whoever says to the guilty, “You are innocent,”
PRO.24.24	will be cursed by peoples and denounced by nations.
PRO.24.25	But it will go well with those who convict the guilty,
PRO.24.25	and rich blessing will come on them.
PRO.24.26	An honest answer
PRO.24.26	is like a kiss on the lips.
PRO.24.27	Put your outdoor work in order
PRO.24.27	and get your fields ready;
PRO.24.27	after that, build your house.
PRO.24.28	Do not testify against your neighbor without cause—
PRO.24.28	would you use your lips to mislead?
PRO.24.29	Do not say, “I’ll do to them as they have done to me;
PRO.24.29	I’ll pay them back for what they did.”
PRO.24.30	I went past the field of a sluggard,
PRO.24.30	past the vineyard of someone who has no sense;
PRO.24.31	thorns had come up everywhere,
PRO.24.31	the ground was covered with weeds,
PRO.24.31	and the stone wall was in ruins.
PRO.24.32	I applied my heart to what I observed
PRO.24.32	and learned a lesson from what I saw:
PRO.24.33	A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.24.33	a little folding of the hands to rest—
PRO.24.34	and poverty will come on you like a thief
PRO.24.34	and scarcity like an armed man.
PRO.25.1	These are more proverbs of Solomon, compiled by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:
PRO.25.2	It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;
PRO.25.2	to search out a matter is the glory of kings.
PRO.25.3	As the heavens are high and the earth is deep,
PRO.25.3	so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
PRO.25.4	Remove the dross from the silver,
PRO.25.4	and a silversmith can produce a vessel;
PRO.25.5	remove wicked officials from the king’s presence,
PRO.25.5	and his throne will be established through righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Do not exalt yourself in the king’s presence,
PRO.25.6	and do not claim a place among his great men;
PRO.25.7	it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,”
PRO.25.7	than for him to humiliate you before his nobles.
PRO.25.7	What you have seen with your eyes
PRO.25.8	do not bring
PRO.25.8	for what will you do in the end
PRO.25.8	if your neighbor puts you to shame?
PRO.25.9	If you take your neighbor to court,
PRO.25.9	do not betray another’s confidence,
PRO.25.10	or the one who hears it may shame you
PRO.25.10	and the charge against you will stand.
PRO.25.11	Like apples
PRO.25.11	is a ruling rightly given.
PRO.25.12	Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold
PRO.25.12	is the rebuke of a wise judge to a listening ear.
PRO.25.13	Like a snow-cooled drink at harvest time
PRO.25.13	is a trustworthy messenger to the one who sends him;
PRO.25.13	he refreshes the spirit of his master.
PRO.25.14	Like clouds and wind without rain
PRO.25.14	is one who boasts of gifts never given.
PRO.25.15	Through patience a ruler can be persuaded,
PRO.25.15	and a gentle tongue can break a bone.
PRO.25.16	If you find honey, eat just enough—
PRO.25.16	too much of it, and you will vomit.
PRO.25.17	Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house—
PRO.25.17	too much of you, and they will hate you.
PRO.25.18	Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow
PRO.25.18	is one who gives false testimony against a neighbor.
PRO.25.19	Like a broken tooth or a lame foot
PRO.25.19	is reliance on the unfaithful in a time of trouble.
PRO.25.20	Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day,
PRO.25.20	or like vinegar poured on a wound,
PRO.25.20	is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
PRO.25.21	If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat;
PRO.25.21	if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
PRO.25.22	In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head,
PRO.25.22	and the 
PRO.25.23	Like a north wind that brings unexpected rain
PRO.25.23	is a sly tongue—which provokes a horrified look.
PRO.25.24	Better to live on a corner of the roof
PRO.25.24	than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
PRO.25.25	Like cold water to a weary soul
PRO.25.25	is good news from a distant land.
PRO.25.26	Like a muddied spring or a polluted well
PRO.25.26	are the righteous who give way to the wicked.
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat too much honey,
PRO.25.27	nor is it honorable to search out matters that are too deep.
PRO.25.28	Like a city whose walls are broken through
PRO.25.28	is a person who lacks self-control.
PRO.26.1	Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,
PRO.26.1	honor is not fitting for a fool.
PRO.26.2	Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow,
PRO.26.2	an undeserved curse does not come to rest.
PRO.26.3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
PRO.26.3	and a rod for the backs of fools!
PRO.26.4	Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.4	or you yourself will be just like him.
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.5	or he will be wise in his own eyes.
PRO.26.6	Sending a message by the hands of a fool
PRO.26.6	is like cutting off one’s feet or drinking poison.
PRO.26.7	Like the useless legs of one who is lame
PRO.26.7	is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
PRO.26.8	Like tying a stone in a sling
PRO.26.8	is the giving of honor to a fool.
PRO.26.9	Like a thornbush in a drunkard’s hand
PRO.26.9	is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
PRO.26.10	Like an archer who wounds at random
PRO.26.10	is one who hires a fool or any passer-by.
PRO.26.11	As a dog returns to its vomit,
PRO.26.11	so fools repeat their folly.
PRO.26.12	Do you see a person wise in their own eyes?
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a fool than for them.
PRO.26.13	A sluggard says, “There’s a lion in the road,
PRO.26.13	a fierce lion roaming the streets!”
PRO.26.14	As a door turns on its hinges,
PRO.26.14	so a sluggard turns on his bed.
PRO.26.15	A sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
PRO.26.15	he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
PRO.26.16	A sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
PRO.26.16	than seven people who answer discreetly.
PRO.26.17	Like one who grabs a stray dog by the ears
PRO.26.17	is someone who rushes into a quarrel not their own.
PRO.26.18	Like a maniac shooting
PRO.26.18	flaming arrows of death
PRO.26.19	is one who deceives their neighbor
PRO.26.19	and says, “I was only joking!”
PRO.26.20	Without wood a fire goes out;
PRO.26.20	without a gossip a quarrel dies down.
PRO.26.21	As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire,
PRO.26.21	so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.
PRO.26.22	The words of a gossip are like choice morsels;
PRO.26.22	they go down to the inmost parts.
PRO.26.23	Like a coating of silver dross on earthenware
PRO.26.23	are fervent
PRO.26.24	Enemies disguise themselves with their lips,
PRO.26.24	but in their hearts they harbor deceit.
PRO.26.25	Though their speech is charming, do not believe them,
PRO.26.25	for seven abominations fill their hearts.
PRO.26.26	Their malice may be concealed by deception,
PRO.26.26	but their wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
PRO.26.27	Whoever digs a pit will fall into it;
PRO.26.27	if someone rolls a stone, it will roll back on them.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hates those it hurts,
PRO.26.28	and a flattering mouth works ruin.
PRO.27.1	Do not boast about tomorrow,
PRO.27.1	for you do not know what a day may bring.
PRO.27.2	Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth;
PRO.27.2	an outsider, and not your own lips.
PRO.27.3	Stone is heavy and sand a burden,
PRO.27.3	but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.
PRO.27.4	Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming,
PRO.27.4	but who can stand before jealousy?
PRO.27.5	Better is open rebuke
PRO.27.5	than hidden love.
PRO.27.6	Wounds from a friend can be trusted,
PRO.27.6	but an enemy multiplies kisses.
PRO.27.7	One who is full loathes honey from the comb,
PRO.27.7	but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet.
PRO.27.8	Like a bird that flees its nest
PRO.27.8	is anyone who flees from home.
PRO.27.9	Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart,
PRO.27.9	and the pleasantness of a friend
PRO.27.9	springs from their heartfelt advice.
PRO.27.10	Do not forsake your friend or a friend of your family,
PRO.27.10	and do not go to your relative’s house when disaster strikes you—
PRO.27.10	better a neighbor nearby than a relative far away.
PRO.27.11	Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart;
PRO.27.11	then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt.
PRO.27.12	The prudent see danger and take refuge,
PRO.27.12	but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.
PRO.27.13	Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger;
PRO.27.13	hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider.
PRO.27.14	If anyone loudly blesses their neighbor early in the morning,
PRO.27.14	it will be taken as a curse.
PRO.27.15	A quarrelsome wife is like the dripping
PRO.27.15	of a leaky roof in a rainstorm;
PRO.27.16	restraining her is like restraining the wind
PRO.27.16	or grasping oil with the hand.
PRO.27.17	As iron sharpens iron,
PRO.27.17	so one person sharpens another.
PRO.27.18	The one who guards a fig tree will eat its fruit,
PRO.27.18	and whoever protects their master will be honored.
PRO.27.19	As water reflects the face,
PRO.27.19	so one’s life reflects the heart.
PRO.27.20	Death and Destruction
PRO.27.20	and neither are human eyes.
PRO.27.21	The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold,
PRO.27.21	but people are tested by their praise.
PRO.27.22	Though you grind a fool in a mortar,
PRO.27.22	grinding them like grain with a pestle,
PRO.27.22	you will not remove their folly from them.
PRO.27.23	Be sure you know the condition of your flocks,
PRO.27.23	give careful attention to your herds;
PRO.27.24	for riches do not endure forever,
PRO.27.24	and a crown is not secure for all generations.
PRO.27.25	When the hay is removed and new growth appears
PRO.27.25	and the grass from the hills is gathered in,
PRO.27.26	the lambs will provide you with clothing,
PRO.27.26	and the goats with the price of a field.
PRO.27.27	You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed your family
PRO.27.27	and to nourish your female servants.
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee though no one pursues,
PRO.28.1	but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
PRO.28.2	When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers,
PRO.28.2	but a ruler with discernment and knowledge maintains order.
PRO.28.3	A ruler
PRO.28.3	is like a driving rain that leaves no crops.
PRO.28.4	Those who forsake instruction praise the wicked,
PRO.28.4	but those who heed it resist them.
PRO.28.5	Evildoers do not understand what is right,
PRO.28.5	but those who seek the 
PRO.28.6	Better the poor whose walk is blameless
PRO.28.6	than the rich whose ways are perverse.

PRO.28.8	amasses it for another, who will be kind to the poor.
PRO.28.9	If anyone turns a deaf ear to my instruction,

PRO.28.10	Whoever leads the upright along an evil path
PRO.28.10	will fall into their own trap,

PRO.28.11	The rich are wise in their own eyes;
PRO.28.11	one who is poor and discerning sees how deluded they are.
PRO.28.12	When the righteous triumph, there is great elation;
PRO.28.12	but when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding.
PRO.28.13	Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper,

PRO.28.15	Like a roaring lion or a charging bear
PRO.28.15	is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.

PRO.28.19	Those who work their land will have abundant food,

PRO.28.20	A faithful person will be richly blessed,

PRO.28.21	To show partiality is not good—

PRO.28.22	The stingy are eager to get rich
PRO.28.22	and are unaware that poverty awaits them.
PRO.28.23	Whoever rebukes a person will in the end gain favor

PRO.30.1	The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh—an inspired utterance.
PRO.30.1	This man’s utterance to Ithiel:
PRO.30.1	“I am weary, God,
PRO.30.1	but I can prevail.
PRO.30.2	Surely I am only a brute, not a man;
PRO.30.2	I do not have human understanding.
PRO.30.3	I have not learned wisdom,
PRO.30.3	nor have I attained to the knowledge of the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	Who has gone up to heaven and come down?
PRO.30.4	Whose hands have gathered up the wind?
PRO.30.4	Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak?
PRO.30.4	Who has established all the ends of the earth?
PRO.30.4	What is his name, and what is the name of his son?
PRO.30.4	Surely you know!
PRO.30.5	“Every word of God is flawless;
PRO.30.5	he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
PRO.30.6	Do not add to his words,
PRO.30.6	or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.
PRO.30.7	“Two things I ask of you, 
PRO.30.7	do not refuse me before I die:
PRO.30.8	Keep falsehood and lies far from me;
PRO.30.8	give me neither poverty nor riches,
PRO.30.8	but give me only my daily bread.
PRO.30.9	Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you
PRO.30.9	and say, ‘Who is the 
PRO.30.9	Or I may become poor and steal,
PRO.30.9	and so dishonor the name of my God.
PRO.30.10	“Do not slander a servant to their master,
PRO.30.10	or they will curse you, and you will pay for it.
PRO.30.11	“There are those who curse their fathers
PRO.30.11	and do not bless their mothers;
PRO.30.12	those who are pure in their own eyes
PRO.30.12	and yet are not cleansed of their filth;
PRO.30.13	those whose eyes are ever so haughty,
PRO.30.13	whose glances are so disdainful;
PRO.30.14	those whose teeth are swords
PRO.30.14	and whose jaws are set with knives
PRO.30.14	to devour the poor from the earth
PRO.30.14	and the needy from among mankind.
PRO.30.15	“The leech has two daughters.
PRO.30.15	‘Give! Give!’ they cry.
PRO.30.15	“There are three things that are never satisfied,
PRO.30.15	four that never say, ‘Enough!’:
PRO.30.16	the grave, the barren womb,
PRO.30.16	land, which is never satisfied with water,
PRO.30.16	and fire, which never says, ‘Enough!’
PRO.30.17	“The eye that mocks a father,
PRO.30.17	that scorns an aged mother,
PRO.30.17	will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley,
PRO.30.17	will be eaten by the vultures.
PRO.30.18	“There are three things that are too amazing for me,
PRO.30.18	four that I do not understand:
PRO.30.19	the way of an eagle in the sky,
PRO.30.19	the way of a snake on a rock,
PRO.30.19	the way of a ship on the high seas,
PRO.30.19	and the way of a man with a young woman.
PRO.30.20	“This is the way of an adulterous woman:
PRO.30.20	She eats and wipes her mouth
PRO.30.20	and says, ‘I’ve done nothing wrong.’
PRO.30.21	“Under three things the earth trembles,
PRO.30.21	under four it cannot bear up:
PRO.30.22	a servant who becomes king,
PRO.30.22	a godless fool who gets plenty to eat,
PRO.30.23	a contemptible woman who gets married,
PRO.30.23	and a servant who displaces her mistress.
PRO.30.24	“Four things on earth are small,
PRO.30.24	yet they are extremely wise:
PRO.30.25	Ants are creatures of little strength,
PRO.30.25	yet they store up their food in the summer;
PRO.30.26	hyraxes are creatures of little power,
PRO.30.26	yet they make their home in the crags;
PRO.30.27	locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	yet they advance together in ranks;
PRO.30.28	a lizard can be caught with the hand,
PRO.30.28	yet it is found in kings’ palaces.
PRO.30.29	“There are three things that are stately in their stride,
PRO.30.29	four that move with stately bearing:
PRO.30.30	a lion, mighty among beasts,
PRO.30.30	who retreats before nothing;
PRO.30.31	a strutting rooster, a he-goat,
PRO.30.31	and a king secure against revolt.
PRO.30.32	“If you play the fool and exalt yourself,
PRO.30.32	or if you plan evil,
PRO.30.32	clap your hand over your mouth!
PRO.30.33	For as churning cream produces butter,
PRO.30.33	and as twisting the nose produces blood,
PRO.30.33	so stirring up anger produces strife.”
PRO.31.1	The sayings of King Lemuel—an inspired utterance his mother taught him.
PRO.31.2	Listen, my son! Listen, son of my womb!
PRO.31.2	Listen, my son, the answer to my prayers!
PRO.31.3	Do not spend your strength
PRO.31.3	your vigor on those who ruin kings.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, Lemuel—
PRO.31.4	it is not for kings to drink wine,
PRO.31.4	not for rulers to crave beer,
PRO.31.5	lest they drink and forget what has been decreed,
PRO.31.5	and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.
PRO.31.6	Let beer be for those who are perishing,
PRO.31.6	wine for those who are in anguish!
PRO.31.7	Let them drink and forget their poverty
PRO.31.7	and remember their misery no more.
PRO.31.8	Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,
PRO.31.8	for the rights of all who are destitute.
PRO.31.9	Speak up and judge fairly;

PRO.31.12	all the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She selects wool and flax
PRO.31.13	and works with eager hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like the merchant ships,
PRO.31.14	bringing her food from afar.
PRO.31.15	She gets up while it is still night;
PRO.31.15	she provides food for her family
PRO.31.15	and portions for her female servants.
PRO.31.16	She considers a field and buys it;
PRO.31.16	out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She sets about her work vigorously;
PRO.31.17	her arms are strong for her tasks.
PRO.31.18	She sees that her trading is profitable,
PRO.31.18	and her lamp does not go out at night.
PRO.31.19	In her hand she holds the distaff
PRO.31.19	and grasps the spindle with her fingers.
PRO.31.20	She opens her arms to the poor
PRO.31.20	and extends her hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	When it snows, she has no fear for her household;
PRO.31.21	for all of them are clothed in scarlet.
PRO.31.22	She makes coverings for her bed;
PRO.31.22	she is clothed in fine linen and purple.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is respected at the city gate,
PRO.31.23	where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She makes linen garments and sells them,
PRO.31.24	and supplies the merchants with sashes.
PRO.31.25	She is clothed with strength and dignity;
PRO.31.25	she can laugh at the days to come.
PRO.31.26	She speaks with wisdom,
PRO.31.26	and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
PRO.31.27	She watches over the affairs of her household
PRO.31.27	and does not eat the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	Her children arise and call her blessed;
PRO.31.28	her husband also, and he praises her:
PRO.31.29	“Many women do noble things,
PRO.31.29	but you surpass them all.”
PRO.31.30	Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting;
PRO.31.30	but a woman who fears the

PRO.31.31	and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
ECC.1.1	The words of the Teacher,
ECC.1.2	“Meaningless! Meaningless!”
ECC.1.2	says the Teacher.
ECC.1.2	“Utterly meaningless!
ECC.1.2	Everything is meaningless.”
ECC.1.3	What do people gain from all their labors
ECC.1.3	at which they toil under the sun?
ECC.1.4	Generations come and generations go,
ECC.1.4	but the earth remains forever.
ECC.1.5	The sun rises and the sun sets,
ECC.1.5	and hurries back to where it rises.
ECC.1.6	The wind blows to the south
ECC.1.6	and turns to the north;
ECC.1.6	round and round it goes,
ECC.1.6	ever returning on its course.
ECC.1.7	All streams flow into the sea,
ECC.1.7	yet the sea is never full.
ECC.1.7	To the place the streams come from,
ECC.1.7	there they return again.
ECC.1.8	All things are wearisome,
ECC.1.8	more than one can say.
ECC.1.8	The eye never has enough of seeing,
ECC.1.8	nor the ear its fill of hearing.
ECC.1.9	What has been will be again,
ECC.1.9	what has been done will be done again;
ECC.1.9	there is nothing new under the sun.
ECC.1.10	Is there anything of which one can say,
ECC.1.10	“Look! This is something new”?
ECC.1.10	It was here already, long ago;
ECC.1.10	it was here before our time.
ECC.1.11	No one remembers the former generations,
ECC.1.11	and even those yet to come
ECC.1.11	will not be remembered
ECC.1.11	by those who follow them.
ECC.1.12	I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! 
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
ECC.1.15	What is crooked cannot be straightened;
ECC.1.15	what is lacking cannot be counted.
ECC.1.16	I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.” 
ECC.1.17	Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.
ECC.1.18	For with much wisdom comes much sorrow;
ECC.1.18	the more knowledge, the more grief.
ECC.2.1	I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.” But that also proved to be meaningless. 
ECC.2.2	“Laughter,” I said, “is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?” 
ECC.2.3	I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives.
ECC.2.4	I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. 
ECC.2.5	I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. 
ECC.2.6	I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. 
ECC.2.7	I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. 
ECC.2.8	I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem
ECC.2.9	I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.
ECC.2.10	I denied myself nothing my eyes desired;
ECC.2.10	I refused my heart no pleasure.
ECC.2.10	My heart took delight in all my labor,
ECC.2.10	and this was the reward for all my toil.
ECC.2.11	Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done
ECC.2.11	and what I had toiled to achieve,
ECC.2.11	everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;
ECC.2.11	nothing was gained under the sun.
ECC.2.12	Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom,
ECC.2.12	and also madness and folly.
ECC.2.12	What more can the king’s successor do
ECC.2.12	than what has already been done?
ECC.2.13	I saw that wisdom is better than folly,
ECC.2.13	just as light is better than darkness.
ECC.2.14	The wise have eyes in their heads,
ECC.2.14	while the fool walks in the darkness;
ECC.2.14	but I came to realize
ECC.2.14	that the same fate overtakes them both.
ECC.2.15	Then I said to myself,
ECC.2.15	“The fate of the fool will overtake me also.
ECC.2.15	What then do I gain by being wise?”
ECC.2.15	I said to myself,
ECC.2.15	“This too is meaningless.”
ECC.2.16	For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered;
ECC.2.16	the days have already come when both have been forgotten.
ECC.2.16	Like the fool, the wise too must die!
ECC.2.17	So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 
ECC.2.18	I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me. 
ECC.2.19	And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. 
ECC.2.20	So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. 
ECC.2.21	For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. 
ECC.2.22	What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? 
ECC.2.23	All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.
ECC.2.24	A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, 
ECC.2.25	for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment? 
ECC.2.26	To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
ECC.3.1	There is a time for everything,
ECC.3.1	and a season for every activity under the heavens:
ECC.3.2	a time to be born and a time to die,
ECC.3.2	a time to plant and a time to uproot,
ECC.3.3	a time to kill and a time to heal,
ECC.3.3	a time to tear down and a time to build,
ECC.3.4	a time to weep and a time to laugh,
ECC.3.4	a time to mourn and a time to dance,
ECC.3.5	a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,
ECC.3.5	a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,
ECC.3.6	a time to search and a time to give up,
ECC.3.6	a time to keep and a time to throw away,
ECC.3.7	a time to tear and a time to mend,
ECC.3.7	a time to be silent and a time to speak,
ECC.3.8	a time to love and a time to hate,
ECC.3.8	a time for war and a time for peace.
ECC.3.9	What do workers gain from their toil? 
ECC.3.10	I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. 
ECC.3.11	He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet
ECC.3.12	I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. 
ECC.3.13	That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God. 
ECC.3.14	I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him.
ECC.3.15	Whatever is has already been,
ECC.3.15	and what will be has been before;
ECC.3.15	and God will call the past to account.
ECC.3.16	And I saw something else under the sun:
ECC.3.16	In the place of judgment—wickedness was there,
ECC.3.16	in the place of justice—wickedness was there.
ECC.3.17	I said to myself,
ECC.3.17	“God will bring into judgment
ECC.3.17	both the righteous and the wicked,
ECC.3.17	for there will be a time for every activity,
ECC.3.17	a time to judge every deed.”
ECC.3.18	I also said to myself, “As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals. 
ECC.3.19	Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath
ECC.3.20	All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return. 
ECC.3.21	Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?”
ECC.3.22	So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?
ECC.4.1	Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun:
ECC.4.1	I saw the tears of the oppressed—
ECC.4.1	and they have no comforter;
ECC.4.1	power was on the side of their oppressors—
ECC.4.1	and they have no comforter.
ECC.4.2	And I declared that the dead,
ECC.4.2	who had already died,
ECC.4.2	are happier than the living,
ECC.4.2	who are still alive.
ECC.4.3	But better than both
ECC.4.3	is the one who has never been born,
ECC.4.3	who has not seen the evil
ECC.4.3	that is done under the sun.
ECC.4.4	And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person’s envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
ECC.4.5	Fools fold their hands
ECC.4.5	and ruin themselves.
ECC.4.6	Better one handful with tranquillity
ECC.4.6	than two handfuls with toil
ECC.4.6	and chasing after the wind.
ECC.4.7	Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:
ECC.4.8	There was a man all alone;
ECC.4.8	he had neither son nor brother.
ECC.4.8	There was no end to his toil,
ECC.4.8	yet his eyes were not content with his wealth.
ECC.4.8	“For whom am I toiling,” he asked,
ECC.4.8	“and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?”
ECC.4.8	This too is meaningless—
ECC.4.8	a miserable business!
ECC.4.9	Two are better than one,
ECC.4.9	because they have a good return for their labor:
ECC.4.10	If either of them falls down,
ECC.4.10	one can help the other up.
ECC.4.10	But pity anyone who falls
ECC.4.10	and has no one to help them up.
ECC.4.11	Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.
ECC.4.11	But how can one keep warm alone?
ECC.4.12	Though one may be overpowered,
ECC.4.12	two can defend themselves.
ECC.4.12	A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.
ECC.4.13	Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning. 
ECC.4.14	The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom. 
ECC.4.15	I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king’s successor. 
ECC.4.16	There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
ECC.5.1	Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong.
ECC.5.2	Do not be quick with your mouth,
ECC.5.2	do not be hasty in your heart
ECC.5.2	to utter anything before God.
ECC.5.2	God is in heaven
ECC.5.2	and you are on earth,
ECC.5.2	so let your words be few.
ECC.5.3	A dream comes when there are many cares,
ECC.5.3	and many words mark the speech of a fool.
ECC.5.4	When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. 
ECC.5.5	It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it. 
ECC.5.6	Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, “My vow was a mistake.” Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands? 
ECC.5.7	Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore fear God.
ECC.5.8	If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still. 
ECC.5.9	The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields.
ECC.5.10	Whoever loves money never has enough;
ECC.5.10	whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income.
ECC.5.10	This too is meaningless.
ECC.5.11	As goods increase,
ECC.5.11	so do those who consume them.
ECC.5.11	And what benefit are they to the owners
ECC.5.11	except to feast their eyes on them?
ECC.5.12	The sleep of a laborer is sweet,
ECC.5.12	whether they eat little or much,
ECC.5.12	but as for the rich, their abundance
ECC.5.12	permits them no sleep.
ECC.5.13	I have seen a grievous evil under the sun:
ECC.5.13	wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners,
ECC.5.14	or wealth lost through some misfortune,
ECC.5.14	so that when they have children
ECC.5.14	there is nothing left for them to inherit.
ECC.5.15	Everyone comes naked from their mother’s womb,
ECC.5.15	and as everyone comes, so they depart.
ECC.5.15	They take nothing from their toil
ECC.5.15	that they can carry in their hands.
ECC.5.16	This too is a grievous evil:
ECC.5.16	As everyone comes, so they depart,
ECC.5.16	and what do they gain,
ECC.5.16	since they toil for the wind?
ECC.5.17	All their days they eat in darkness,
ECC.5.17	with great frustration, affliction and anger.
ECC.5.18	This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot. 
ECC.5.19	Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God. 
ECC.5.20	They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart.
ECC.6.1	I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on mankind: 
ECC.6.2	God gives some people wealth, possessions and honor, so that they lack nothing their hearts desire, but God does not grant them the ability to enjoy them, and strangers enjoy them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil.
ECC.6.3	A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he. 
ECC.6.4	It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded. 
ECC.6.5	Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man— 
ECC.6.6	even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?
ECC.6.7	Everyone’s toil is for their mouth,
ECC.6.7	yet their appetite is never satisfied.
ECC.6.8	What advantage have the wise over fools?
ECC.6.8	What do the poor gain
ECC.6.8	by knowing how to conduct themselves before others?
ECC.6.9	Better what the eye sees
ECC.6.9	than the roving of the appetite.
ECC.6.9	This too is meaningless,
ECC.6.9	a chasing after the wind.
ECC.6.10	Whatever exists has already been named,
ECC.6.10	and what humanity is has been known;
ECC.6.10	no one can contend
ECC.6.10	with someone who is stronger.
ECC.6.11	The more the words,
ECC.6.11	the less the meaning,
ECC.6.11	and how does that profit anyone?
ECC.6.12	For who knows what is good for a person in life, during the few and meaningless days they pass through like a shadow? Who can tell them what will happen under the sun after they are gone?
ECC.7.1	A good name is better than fine perfume,
ECC.7.1	and the day of death better than the day of birth.
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to a house of mourning
ECC.7.2	than to go to a house of feasting,
ECC.7.2	for death is the destiny of everyone;
ECC.7.2	the living should take this to heart.
ECC.7.3	Frustration is better than laughter,
ECC.7.3	because a sad face is good for the heart.
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
ECC.7.4	but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
ECC.7.5	It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person
ECC.7.5	than to listen to the song of fools.
ECC.7.6	Like the crackling of thorns under the pot,
ECC.7.6	so is the laughter of fools.
ECC.7.6	This too is meaningless.
ECC.7.7	Extortion turns a wise person into a fool,
ECC.7.7	and a bribe corrupts the heart.
ECC.7.8	The end of a matter is better than its beginning,
ECC.7.8	and patience is better than pride.
ECC.7.9	Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit,
ECC.7.9	for anger resides in the lap of fools.
ECC.7.10	Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?”
ECC.7.10	For it is not wise to ask such questions.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing
ECC.7.11	and benefits those who see the sun.
ECC.7.12	Wisdom is a shelter
ECC.7.12	as money is a shelter,
ECC.7.12	but the advantage of knowledge is this:
ECC.7.12	Wisdom preserves those who have it.
ECC.7.13	Consider what God has done:
ECC.7.13	Who can straighten
ECC.7.13	what he has made crooked?
ECC.7.14	When times are good, be happy;
ECC.7.14	but when times are bad, consider this:
ECC.7.14	God has made the one
ECC.7.14	as well as the other.
ECC.7.14	Therefore, no one can discover
ECC.7.14	anything about their future.
ECC.7.15	In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these:
ECC.7.15	the righteous perishing in their righteousness,
ECC.7.15	and the wicked living long in their wickedness.
ECC.7.16	Do not be overrighteous,
ECC.7.16	neither be overwise—
ECC.7.16	why destroy yourself?
ECC.7.17	Do not be overwicked,
ECC.7.17	and do not be a fool—
ECC.7.17	why die before your time?
ECC.7.18	It is good to grasp the one
ECC.7.18	and not let go of the other.
ECC.7.18	Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.
ECC.7.19	Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful
ECC.7.19	than ten rulers in a city.
ECC.7.20	Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous,
ECC.7.20	no one who does what is right and never sins.
ECC.7.21	Do not pay attention to every word people say,
ECC.7.21	or you may hear your servant cursing you—
ECC.7.22	for you know in your heart
ECC.7.22	that many times you yourself have cursed others.
ECC.7.23	All this I tested by wisdom and I said,
ECC.7.23	“I am determined to be wise”—
ECC.7.23	but this was beyond me.
ECC.7.24	Whatever exists is far off and most profound—
ECC.7.24	who can discover it?
ECC.7.25	So I turned my mind to understand,
ECC.7.25	to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things
ECC.7.25	and to understand the stupidity of wickedness
ECC.7.25	and the madness of folly.
ECC.7.26	I find more bitter than death
ECC.7.26	the woman who is a snare,
ECC.7.26	whose heart is a trap
ECC.7.26	and whose hands are chains.
ECC.7.26	The man who pleases God will escape her,
ECC.7.26	but the sinner she will ensnare.
ECC.7.27	“Look,” says the Teacher,
ECC.7.27	“Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things—
ECC.7.28	while I was still searching
ECC.7.28	but not finding—
ECC.7.28	I found one upright man among a thousand,
ECC.7.28	but not one upright woman among them all.
ECC.7.29	This only have I found:
ECC.7.29	God created mankind upright,
ECC.7.29	but they have gone in search of many schemes.”
ECC.8.1	Who is like the wise?
ECC.8.1	Who knows the explanation of things?
ECC.8.1	A person’s wisdom brightens their face
ECC.8.1	and changes its hard appearance.
ECC.8.2	Obey the king’s command, I say, because you took an oath before God. 
ECC.8.3	Do not be in a hurry to leave the king’s presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases. 
ECC.8.4	Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him, “What are you doing?”
ECC.8.5	Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm,
ECC.8.5	and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.
ECC.8.6	For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,
ECC.8.6	though a person may be weighed down by misery.
ECC.8.7	Since no one knows the future,
ECC.8.7	who can tell someone else what is to come?
ECC.8.8	As no one has power over the wind to contain it,
ECC.8.8	so
ECC.8.8	As no one is discharged in time of war,
ECC.8.8	so wickedness will not release those who practice it.
ECC.8.9	All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own
ECC.8.10	Then too, I saw the wicked buried—those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise
ECC.8.11	When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people’s hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong. 
ECC.8.12	Although a wicked person who commits a hundred crimes may live a long time, I know that it will go better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him. 
ECC.8.13	Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.
ECC.8.14	There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless. 
ECC.8.15	So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun.
ECC.8.16	When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth—people getting no sleep day or night— 
ECC.8.17	then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it.
ECC.9.1	So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God’s hands, but no one knows whether love or hate awaits them. 
ECC.9.2	All share a common destiny—the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad,
ECC.9.2	As it is with the good,
ECC.9.2	so with the sinful;
ECC.9.2	as it is with those who take oaths,
ECC.9.2	so with those who are afraid to take them.
ECC.9.3	This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead. 
ECC.9.4	Anyone who is among the living has hope
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they will die,
ECC.9.5	but the dead know nothing;
ECC.9.5	they have no further reward,
ECC.9.5	and even their name is forgotten.
ECC.9.6	Their love, their hate
ECC.9.6	and their jealousy have long since vanished;
ECC.9.6	never again will they have a part
ECC.9.6	in anything that happens under the sun.
ECC.9.7	Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do. 
ECC.9.8	Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil. 
ECC.9.9	Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun—all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun. 
ECC.9.10	Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.
ECC.9.11	I have seen something else under the sun:
ECC.9.11	The race is not to the swift
ECC.9.11	or the battle to the strong,
ECC.9.11	nor does food come to the wise
ECC.9.11	or wealth to the brilliant
ECC.9.11	or favor to the learned;
ECC.9.11	but time and chance happen to them all.
ECC.9.12	Moreover, no one knows when their hour will come:
ECC.9.12	As fish are caught in a cruel net,
ECC.9.12	or birds are taken in a snare,
ECC.9.12	so people are trapped by evil times
ECC.9.12	that fall unexpectedly upon them.
ECC.9.13	I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me: 
ECC.9.14	There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it. 
ECC.9.15	Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man. 
ECC.9.16	So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.
ECC.9.17	The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded
ECC.9.17	than the shouts of a ruler of fools.
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
ECC.9.18	but one sinner destroys much good.
ECC.10.1	As dead flies give perfume a bad smell,
ECC.10.1	so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
ECC.10.2	The heart of the wise inclines to the right,
ECC.10.2	but the heart of the fool to the left.
ECC.10.3	Even as fools walk along the road,
ECC.10.3	they lack sense
ECC.10.3	and show everyone how stupid they are.
ECC.10.4	If a ruler’s anger rises against you,
ECC.10.4	do not leave your post;
ECC.10.4	calmness can lay great offenses to rest.
ECC.10.5	There is an evil I have seen under the sun,
ECC.10.5	the sort of error that arises from a ruler:
ECC.10.6	Fools are put in many high positions,
ECC.10.6	while the rich occupy the low ones.
ECC.10.7	I have seen slaves on horseback,
ECC.10.7	while princes go on foot like slaves.
ECC.10.8	Whoever digs a pit may fall into it;
ECC.10.8	whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
ECC.10.9	Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them;
ECC.10.9	whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.
ECC.10.10	If the ax is dull
ECC.10.10	and its edge unsharpened,
ECC.10.10	more strength is needed,
ECC.10.10	but skill will bring success.
ECC.10.11	If a snake bites before it is charmed,
ECC.10.11	the charmer receives no fee.
ECC.10.12	Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious,
ECC.10.12	but fools are consumed by their own lips.
ECC.10.13	At the beginning their words are folly;
ECC.10.13	at the end they are wicked madness—
ECC.10.14	and fools multiply words.
ECC.10.14	No one knows what is coming—
ECC.10.14	who can tell someone else what will happen after them?
ECC.10.15	The toil of fools wearies them;
ECC.10.15	they do not know the way to town.
ECC.10.16	Woe to the land whose king was a servant
ECC.10.16	and whose princes feast in the morning.
ECC.10.17	Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth
ECC.10.17	and whose princes eat at a proper time—
ECC.10.17	for strength and not for drunkenness.
ECC.10.18	Through laziness, the rafters sag;
ECC.10.18	because of idle hands, the house leaks.
ECC.10.19	A feast is made for laughter,
ECC.10.19	wine makes life merry,
ECC.10.19	and money is the answer for everything.
ECC.10.20	Do not revile the king even in your thoughts,
ECC.10.20	or curse the rich in your bedroom,
ECC.10.20	because a bird in the sky may carry your words,
ECC.10.20	and a bird on the wing may report what you say.
ECC.11.1	Ship your grain across the sea;
ECC.11.1	after many days you may receive a return.
ECC.11.2	Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight;
ECC.11.2	you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.
ECC.11.3	If clouds are full of water,
ECC.11.3	they pour rain on the earth.
ECC.11.3	Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north,
ECC.11.3	in the place where it falls, there it will lie.
ECC.11.4	Whoever watches the wind will not plant;
ECC.11.4	whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.
ECC.11.5	As you do not know the path of the wind,
ECC.11.5	or how the body is formed
ECC.11.5	so you cannot understand the work of God,
ECC.11.5	the Maker of all things.
ECC.11.6	Sow your seed in the morning,
ECC.11.6	and at evening let your hands not be idle,
ECC.11.6	for you do not know which will succeed,
ECC.11.6	whether this or that,
ECC.11.6	or whether both will do equally well.
ECC.11.7	Light is sweet,
ECC.11.7	and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.
ECC.11.8	However many years anyone may live,
ECC.11.8	let them enjoy them all.
ECC.11.8	But let them remember the days of darkness,
ECC.11.8	for there will be many.
ECC.11.8	Everything to come is meaningless.
ECC.11.9	You who are young, be happy while you are young,
ECC.11.9	and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth.
ECC.11.9	Follow the ways of your heart
ECC.11.9	and whatever your eyes see,
ECC.11.9	but know that for all these things
ECC.11.9	God will bring you into judgment.
ECC.11.10	So then, banish anxiety from your heart
ECC.11.10	and cast off the troubles of your body,
ECC.11.10	for youth and vigor are meaningless.
ECC.12.1	Remember your Creator
ECC.12.1	in the days of your youth,
ECC.12.1	before the days of trouble come
ECC.12.1	and the years approach when you will say,
ECC.12.1	“I find no pleasure in them”—
ECC.12.2	before the sun and the light
ECC.12.2	and the moon and the stars grow dark,
ECC.12.2	and the clouds return after the rain;
ECC.12.3	when the keepers of the house tremble,
ECC.12.3	and the strong men stoop,
ECC.12.3	when the grinders cease because they are few,
ECC.12.3	and those looking through the windows grow dim;
ECC.12.4	when the doors to the street are closed
ECC.12.4	and the sound of grinding fades;
ECC.12.4	when people rise up at the sound of birds,
ECC.12.4	but all their songs grow faint;
ECC.12.5	when people are afraid of heights
ECC.12.5	and of dangers in the streets;
ECC.12.5	when the almond tree blossoms
ECC.12.5	and the grasshopper drags itself along
ECC.12.5	and desire no longer is stirred.
ECC.12.5	Then people go to their eternal home
ECC.12.5	and mourners go about the streets.
ECC.12.6	Remember him—before the silver cord is severed,
ECC.12.6	and the golden bowl is broken;
ECC.12.6	before the pitcher is shattered at the spring,
ECC.12.6	and the wheel broken at the well,
ECC.12.7	and the dust returns to the ground it came from,
ECC.12.7	and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
ECC.12.8	“Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher.
ECC.12.8	“Everything is meaningless!”
ECC.12.9	Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs. 
ECC.12.10	The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one shepherd.
ECC.12.12	Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.
ECC.12.12	Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.
ECC.12.13	Now all has been heard;
ECC.12.13	here is the conclusion of the matter:
ECC.12.13	Fear God and keep his commandments,
ECC.12.13	for this is the duty of all mankind.
ECC.12.14	For God will bring every deed into judgment,
ECC.12.14	including every hidden thing,
ECC.12.14	whether it is good or evil.
SNG.1.1	Solomon’s Song of Songs.
SNG.1.2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth—
SNG.1.2	for your love is more delightful than wine.
SNG.1.3	Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes;
SNG.1.3	your name is like perfume poured out.
SNG.1.3	No wonder the young women love you!
SNG.1.4	Take me away with you—let us hurry!
SNG.1.4	Let the king bring me into his chambers.
SNG.1.4	We rejoice and delight in you
SNG.1.4	we will praise your love more than wine.
SNG.1.4	How right they are to adore you!
SNG.1.5	Dark am I, yet lovely,
SNG.1.5	daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.1.5	dark like the tents of Kedar,
SNG.1.5	like the tent curtains of Solomon.
SNG.1.6	Do not stare at me because I am dark,
SNG.1.6	because I am darkened by the sun.
SNG.1.6	My mother’s sons were angry with me
SNG.1.6	and made me take care of the vineyards;
SNG.1.6	my own vineyard I had to neglect.
SNG.1.7	Tell me, you whom I love,
SNG.1.7	where you graze your flock
SNG.1.7	and where you rest your sheep at midday.
SNG.1.7	Why should I be like a veiled woman
SNG.1.7	beside the flocks of your friends?
SNG.1.8	If you do not know, most beautiful of women,
SNG.1.8	follow the tracks of the sheep
SNG.1.8	and graze your young goats
SNG.1.8	by the tents of the shepherds.
SNG.1.9	I liken you, my darling, to a mare
SNG.1.9	among Pharaoh’s chariot horses.
SNG.1.10	Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings,
SNG.1.10	your neck with strings of jewels.
SNG.1.11	We will make you earrings of gold,
SNG.1.11	studded with silver.
SNG.1.12	While the king was at his table,
SNG.1.12	my perfume spread its fragrance.
SNG.1.13	My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh
SNG.1.13	resting between my breasts.
SNG.1.14	My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms
SNG.1.14	from the vineyards of En Gedi.
SNG.1.15	How beautiful you are, my darling!
SNG.1.15	Oh, how beautiful!
SNG.1.15	Your eyes are doves.
SNG.1.16	How handsome you are, my beloved!
SNG.1.16	Oh, how charming!
SNG.1.16	And our bed is verdant.
SNG.1.17	The beams of our house are cedars;
SNG.1.17	our rafters are firs.
SNG.2.1	I am a rose
SNG.2.1	a lily of the valleys.
SNG.2.2	Like a lily among thorns
SNG.2.2	is my darling among the young women.
SNG.2.3	Like an apple
SNG.2.3	is my beloved among the young men.
SNG.2.3	I delight to sit in his shade,
SNG.2.3	and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
SNG.2.4	Let him lead me to the banquet hall,
SNG.2.4	and let his banner over me be love.
SNG.2.5	Strengthen me with raisins,
SNG.2.5	refresh me with apples,
SNG.2.5	for I am faint with love.
SNG.2.6	His left arm is under my head,
SNG.2.6	and his right arm embraces me.
SNG.2.7	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you
SNG.2.7	by the gazelles and by the does of the field:
SNG.2.7	Do not arouse or awaken love
SNG.2.7	until it so desires.
SNG.2.8	Listen! My beloved!
SNG.2.8	Look! Here he comes,
SNG.2.8	leaping across the mountains,
SNG.2.8	bounding over the hills.
SNG.2.9	My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.
SNG.2.9	Look! There he stands behind our wall,
SNG.2.9	gazing through the windows,
SNG.2.9	peering through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My beloved spoke and said to me,
SNG.2.10	“Arise, my darling,
SNG.2.10	my beautiful one, come with me.
SNG.2.11	See! The winter is past;
SNG.2.11	the rains are over and gone.
SNG.2.12	Flowers appear on the earth;
SNG.2.12	the season of singing has come,
SNG.2.12	the cooing of doves
SNG.2.12	is heard in our land.
SNG.2.13	The fig tree forms its early fruit;
SNG.2.13	the blossoming vines spread their fragrance.
SNG.2.13	Arise, come, my darling;
SNG.2.13	my beautiful one, come with me.”
SNG.2.14	My dove in the clefts of the rock,
SNG.2.14	in the hiding places on the mountainside,
SNG.2.14	show me your face,
SNG.2.14	let me hear your voice;
SNG.2.14	for your voice is sweet,
SNG.2.14	and your face is lovely.
SNG.2.15	Catch for us the foxes,
SNG.2.15	the little foxes
SNG.2.15	that ruin the vineyards,
SNG.2.15	our vineyards that are in bloom.
SNG.2.16	My beloved is mine and I am his;
SNG.2.16	he browses among the lilies.
SNG.2.17	Until the day breaks
SNG.2.17	and the shadows flee,
SNG.2.17	turn, my beloved,
SNG.2.17	and be like a gazelle
SNG.2.17	or like a young stag
SNG.2.17	on the rugged hills.
SNG.3.1	All night long on my bed
SNG.3.1	I looked for the one my heart loves;
SNG.3.1	I looked for him but did not find him.
SNG.3.2	I will get up now and go about the city,
SNG.3.2	through its streets and squares;
SNG.3.2	I will search for the one my heart loves.
SNG.3.2	So I looked for him but did not find him.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen found me
SNG.3.3	as they made their rounds in the city.
SNG.3.3	“Have you seen the one my heart loves?”
SNG.3.4	Scarcely had I passed them
SNG.3.4	when I found the one my heart loves.
SNG.3.4	I held him and would not let him go
SNG.3.4	till I had brought him to my mother’s house,
SNG.3.4	to the room of the one who conceived me.
SNG.3.5	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you
SNG.3.5	by the gazelles and by the does of the field:
SNG.3.5	Do not arouse or awaken love
SNG.3.5	until it so desires.
SNG.3.6	Who is this coming up from the wilderness
SNG.3.6	like a column of smoke,
SNG.3.6	perfumed with myrrh and incense
SNG.3.6	made from all the spices of the merchant?
SNG.3.7	Look! It is Solomon’s carriage,
SNG.3.7	escorted by sixty warriors,
SNG.3.7	the noblest of Israel,
SNG.3.8	all of them wearing the sword,
SNG.3.8	all experienced in battle,
SNG.3.8	each with his sword at his side,
SNG.3.8	prepared for the terrors of the night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon made for himself the carriage;
SNG.3.9	he made it of wood from Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	Its posts he made of silver,
SNG.3.10	its base of gold.
SNG.3.10	Its seat was upholstered with purple,
SNG.3.10	its interior inlaid with love.
SNG.3.10	Daughters of Jerusalem, 
SNG.3.11	come out,
SNG.3.11	and look, you daughters of Zion.
SNG.3.11	Look
SNG.3.11	the crown with which his mother crowned him
SNG.3.11	on the day of his wedding,
SNG.3.11	the day his heart rejoiced.
SNG.4.1	How beautiful you are, my darling!
SNG.4.1	Oh, how beautiful!
SNG.4.1	Your eyes behind your veil are doves.
SNG.4.1	Your hair is like a flock of goats
SNG.4.1	descending from the hills of Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just shorn,
SNG.4.2	coming up from the washing.
SNG.4.2	Each has its twin;
SNG.4.2	not one of them is alone.
SNG.4.3	Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon;
SNG.4.3	your mouth is lovely.
SNG.4.3	Your temples behind your veil
SNG.4.3	are like the halves of a pomegranate.
SNG.4.4	Your neck is like the tower of David,
SNG.4.4	built with courses of stone
SNG.4.4	on it hang a thousand shields,
SNG.4.4	all of them shields of warriors.
SNG.4.5	Your breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.4.5	like twin fawns of a gazelle
SNG.4.5	that browse among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Until the day breaks
SNG.4.6	and the shadows flee,
SNG.4.6	I will go to the mountain of myrrh
SNG.4.6	and to the hill of incense.
SNG.4.7	You are altogether beautiful, my darling;
SNG.4.7	there is no flaw in you.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
SNG.4.8	come with me from Lebanon.
SNG.4.8	Descend from the crest of Amana,
SNG.4.8	from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon,
SNG.4.8	from the lions’ dens
SNG.4.8	and the mountain haunts of leopards.
SNG.4.9	You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride;
SNG.4.9	you have stolen my heart
SNG.4.9	with one glance of your eyes,
SNG.4.9	with one jewel of your necklace.
SNG.4.10	How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride!
SNG.4.10	How much more pleasing is your love than wine,
SNG.4.10	and the fragrance of your perfume
SNG.4.10	more than any spice!
SNG.4.11	Your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride;
SNG.4.11	milk and honey are under your tongue.
SNG.4.11	The fragrance of your garments
SNG.4.11	is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride;
SNG.4.12	you are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain.
SNG.4.13	Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates
SNG.4.13	with choice fruits,
SNG.4.13	with henna and nard,
SNG.4.14	nard and saffron,
SNG.4.14	calamus and cinnamon,
SNG.4.14	with every kind of incense tree,
SNG.4.14	with myrrh and aloes
SNG.4.14	and all the finest spices.
SNG.4.15	You are
SNG.4.15	a well of flowing water
SNG.4.15	streaming down from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awake, north wind,
SNG.4.16	and come, south wind!
SNG.4.16	Blow on my garden,
SNG.4.16	that its fragrance may spread everywhere.
SNG.4.16	Let my beloved come into his garden
SNG.4.16	and taste its choice fruits.
SNG.5.1	I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;
SNG.5.1	I have gathered my myrrh with my spice.
SNG.5.1	I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;
SNG.5.1	I have drunk my wine and my milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, friends, and drink;
SNG.5.1	drink your fill of love.
SNG.5.2	I slept but my heart was awake.
SNG.5.2	Listen! My beloved is knocking:
SNG.5.2	“Open to me, my sister, my darling,
SNG.5.2	my dove, my flawless one.
SNG.5.2	My head is drenched with dew,
SNG.5.2	my hair with the dampness of the night.”
SNG.5.3	I have taken off my robe—
SNG.5.3	must I put it on again?
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet—
SNG.5.3	must I soil them again?
SNG.5.4	My beloved thrust his hand through the latch-opening;
SNG.5.4	my heart began to pound for him.
SNG.5.5	I arose to open for my beloved,
SNG.5.5	and my hands dripped with myrrh,
SNG.5.5	my fingers with flowing myrrh,
SNG.5.5	on the handles of the bolt.
SNG.5.6	I opened for my beloved,
SNG.5.6	but my beloved had left; he was gone.
SNG.5.6	My heart sank at his departure.
SNG.5.6	I looked for him but did not find him.
SNG.5.6	I called him but he did not answer.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen found me
SNG.5.7	as they made their rounds in the city.
SNG.5.7	They beat me, they bruised me;
SNG.5.7	they took away my cloak,
SNG.5.7	those watchmen of the walls!
SNG.5.8	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you—
SNG.5.8	if you find my beloved,
SNG.5.8	what will you tell him?
SNG.5.8	Tell him I am faint with love.
SNG.5.9	How is your beloved better than others,
SNG.5.9	most beautiful of women?
SNG.5.9	How is your beloved better than others,
SNG.5.9	that you so charge us?
SNG.5.10	My beloved is radiant and ruddy,
SNG.5.10	outstanding among ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head is purest gold;
SNG.5.11	his hair is wavy
SNG.5.11	and black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like doves
SNG.5.12	by the water streams,
SNG.5.12	washed in milk,
SNG.5.12	mounted like jewels.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are like beds of spice
SNG.5.13	yielding perfume.
SNG.5.13	His lips are like lilies
SNG.5.13	dripping with myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His arms are rods of gold
SNG.5.14	set with topaz.
SNG.5.14	His body is like polished ivory
SNG.5.14	decorated with lapis lazuli.
SNG.5.15	His legs are pillars of marble
SNG.5.15	set on bases of pure gold.
SNG.5.15	His appearance is like Lebanon,
SNG.5.15	choice as its cedars.
SNG.5.16	His mouth is sweetness itself;
SNG.5.16	he is altogether lovely.
SNG.5.16	This is my beloved, this is my friend,
SNG.5.16	daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	Where has your beloved gone,
SNG.6.1	most beautiful of women?
SNG.6.1	Which way did your beloved turn,
SNG.6.1	that we may look for him with you?
SNG.6.2	My beloved has gone down to his garden,
SNG.6.2	to the beds of spices,
SNG.6.2	to browse in the gardens
SNG.6.2	and to gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine;
SNG.6.3	he browses among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling,
SNG.6.4	as lovely as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	as majestic as troops with banners.
SNG.6.5	Turn your eyes from me;
SNG.6.5	they overwhelm me.
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like a flock of goats
SNG.6.5	descending from Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are like a flock of sheep
SNG.6.6	coming up from the washing.
SNG.6.6	Each has its twin,
SNG.6.6	not one of them is missing.
SNG.6.7	Your temples behind your veil
SNG.6.7	are like the halves of a pomegranate.
SNG.6.8	Sixty queens there may be,
SNG.6.8	and eighty concubines,
SNG.6.8	and virgins beyond number;
SNG.6.9	but my dove, my perfect one, is unique,
SNG.6.9	the only daughter of her mother,
SNG.6.9	the favorite of the one who bore her.
SNG.6.9	The young women saw her and called her blessed;
SNG.6.9	the queens and concubines praised her.
SNG.6.10	Who is this that appears like the dawn,
SNG.6.10	fair as the moon, bright as the sun,
SNG.6.10	majestic as the stars in procession?
SNG.6.11	I went down to the grove of nut trees
SNG.6.11	to look at the new growth in the valley,
SNG.6.11	to see if the vines had budded
SNG.6.11	or the pomegranates were in bloom.
SNG.6.12	Before I realized it,
SNG.6.12	my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people.
SNG.6.13	Come back, come back, O Shulammite;
SNG.6.13	come back, come back, that we may gaze on you!
SNG.6.13	Why would you gaze on the Shulammite
SNG.6.13	as on the dance of Mahanaim?
SNG.7.1	How beautiful your sandaled feet,
SNG.7.1	O prince’s daughter!
SNG.7.1	Your graceful legs are like jewels,
SNG.7.1	the work of an artist’s hands.
SNG.7.2	Your navel is a rounded goblet
SNG.7.2	that never lacks blended wine.
SNG.7.2	Your waist is a mound of wheat
SNG.7.2	encircled by lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.7.3	like twin fawns of a gazelle.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like an ivory tower.
SNG.7.4	Your eyes are the pools of Heshbon
SNG.7.4	by the gate of Bath Rabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon
SNG.7.4	looking toward Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel.
SNG.7.5	Your hair is like royal tapestry;
SNG.7.5	the king is held captive by its tresses.
SNG.7.6	How beautiful you are and how pleasing,
SNG.7.6	my love, with your delights!
SNG.7.7	Your stature is like that of the palm,
SNG.7.7	and your breasts like clusters of fruit.
SNG.7.8	I said, “I will climb the palm tree;
SNG.7.8	I will take hold of its fruit.”
SNG.7.8	May your breasts be like clusters of grapes on the vine,
SNG.7.8	the fragrance of your breath like apples,
SNG.7.9	and your mouth like the best wine.
SNG.7.9	May the wine go straight to my beloved,
SNG.7.9	flowing gently over lips and teeth.
SNG.7.10	I belong to my beloved,
SNG.7.10	and his desire is for me.
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside,
SNG.7.11	let us spend the night in the villages.
SNG.7.12	Let us go early to the vineyards
SNG.7.12	to see if the vines have budded,
SNG.7.12	if their blossoms have opened,
SNG.7.12	and if the pomegranates are in bloom—
SNG.7.12	there I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes send out their fragrance,
SNG.7.13	and at our door is every delicacy,
SNG.7.13	both new and old,
SNG.7.13	that I have stored up for you, my beloved.
SNG.8.1	If only you were to me like a brother,
SNG.8.1	who was nursed at my mother’s breasts!
SNG.8.1	Then, if I found you outside,
SNG.8.1	I would kiss you,
SNG.8.1	and no one would despise me.
SNG.8.2	I would lead you
SNG.8.2	and bring you to my mother’s house—
SNG.8.2	she who has taught me.
SNG.8.2	I would give you spiced wine to drink,
SNG.8.2	the nectar of my pomegranates.
SNG.8.3	His left arm is under my head
SNG.8.3	and his right arm embraces me.
SNG.8.4	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you:
SNG.8.4	Do not arouse or awaken love
SNG.8.4	until it so desires.
SNG.8.5	Who is this coming up from the wilderness
SNG.8.5	leaning on her beloved?
SNG.8.5	Under the apple tree I roused you;
SNG.8.5	there your mother conceived you,
SNG.8.5	there she who was in labor gave you birth.
SNG.8.6	Place me like a seal over your heart,
SNG.8.6	like a seal on your arm;
SNG.8.6	for love is as strong as death,
SNG.8.6	its jealousy
SNG.8.6	It burns like blazing fire,
SNG.8.6	like a mighty flame.
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love;
SNG.8.7	rivers cannot sweep it away.
SNG.8.7	If one were to give
SNG.8.7	all the wealth of one’s house for love,
SNG.8.7	it
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister,
SNG.8.8	and her breasts are not yet grown.
SNG.8.8	What shall we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	on the day she is spoken for?
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall,
SNG.8.9	we will build towers of silver on her.
SNG.8.9	If she is a door,
SNG.8.9	we will enclose her with panels of cedar.
SNG.8.10	I am a wall,
SNG.8.10	and my breasts are like towers.
SNG.8.10	Thus I have become in his eyes
SNG.8.10	like one bringing contentment.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon;
SNG.8.11	he let out his vineyard to tenants.
SNG.8.11	Each was to bring for its fruit
SNG.8.11	a thousand shekels
SNG.8.12	But my own vineyard is mine to give;
SNG.8.12	the thousand shekels are for you, Solomon,
SNG.8.12	and two hundred
SNG.8.13	You who dwell in the gardens
SNG.8.13	with friends in attendance,
SNG.8.13	let me hear your voice!
SNG.8.14	Come away, my beloved,
SNG.8.14	and be like a gazelle
SNG.8.14	or like a young stag
SNG.8.14	on the spice-laden mountains.
ISA.1.1	The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
ISA.1.2	Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth!
ISA.1.2	For the 
ISA.1.2	“I reared children and brought them up,
ISA.1.2	but they have rebelled against me.
ISA.1.3	The ox knows its master,
ISA.1.3	the donkey its owner’s manger,
ISA.1.3	but Israel does not know,
ISA.1.3	my people do not understand.”
ISA.1.4	Woe to the sinful nation,
ISA.1.4	a people whose guilt is great,
ISA.1.4	a brood of evildoers,
ISA.1.4	children given to corruption!
ISA.1.4	They have forsaken the 
ISA.1.4	they have spurned the Holy One of Israel
ISA.1.4	and turned their backs on him.
ISA.1.5	Why should you be beaten anymore?
ISA.1.5	Why do you persist in rebellion?
ISA.1.5	Your whole head is injured,
ISA.1.5	your whole heart afflicted.
ISA.1.6	From the sole of your foot to the top of your head
ISA.1.6	there is no soundness—
ISA.1.6	only wounds and welts
ISA.1.6	and open sores,
ISA.1.6	not cleansed or bandaged
ISA.1.6	or soothed with olive oil.
ISA.1.7	Your country is desolate,
ISA.1.7	your cities burned with fire;
ISA.1.7	your fields are being stripped by foreigners
ISA.1.7	right before you,
ISA.1.7	laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.
ISA.1.8	Daughter Zion is left
ISA.1.8	like a shelter in a vineyard,
ISA.1.8	like a hut in a cucumber field,
ISA.1.8	like a city under siege.
ISA.1.9	Unless the 
ISA.1.9	had left us some survivors,
ISA.1.9	we would have become like Sodom,
ISA.1.9	we would have been like Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of the 
ISA.1.10	you rulers of Sodom;
ISA.1.10	listen to the instruction of our God,
ISA.1.10	you people of Gomorrah!
ISA.1.11	“The multitude of your sacrifices—
ISA.1.11	what are they to me?” says the 
ISA.1.11	“I have more than enough of burnt offerings,
ISA.1.11	of rams and the fat of fattened animals;
ISA.1.11	I have no pleasure
ISA.1.11	in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.
ISA.1.12	When you come to appear before me,
ISA.1.12	who has asked this of you,
ISA.1.12	this trampling of my courts?
ISA.1.13	Stop bringing meaningless offerings!
ISA.1.13	Your incense is detestable to me.
ISA.1.13	New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations—
ISA.1.13	I cannot bear your worthless assemblies.
ISA.1.14	Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals
ISA.1.14	I hate with all my being.
ISA.1.14	They have become a burden to me;
ISA.1.14	I am weary of bearing them.
ISA.1.15	When you spread out your hands in prayer,
ISA.1.15	I hide my eyes from you;
ISA.1.15	even when you offer many prayers,
ISA.1.15	I am not listening.
ISA.1.15	Your hands are full of blood!
ISA.1.16	Wash and make yourselves clean.
ISA.1.16	Take your evil deeds out of my sight;
ISA.1.16	stop doing wrong.
ISA.1.17	Learn to do right; seek justice.
ISA.1.17	Defend the oppressed.
ISA.1.17	Take up the cause of the fatherless;
ISA.1.17	plead the case of the widow.
ISA.1.18	“Come now, let us settle the matter,”
ISA.1.18	says the 
ISA.1.18	“Though your sins are like scarlet,
ISA.1.18	they shall be as white as snow;
ISA.1.18	though they are red as crimson,
ISA.1.18	they shall be like wool.
ISA.1.19	If you are willing and obedient,
ISA.1.19	you will eat the good things of the land;
ISA.1.20	but if you resist and rebel,
ISA.1.20	you will be devoured by the sword.”
ISA.1.20	For the mouth of the 
ISA.1.21	See how the faithful city
ISA.1.21	has become a prostitute!
ISA.1.21	She once was full of justice;
ISA.1.21	righteousness used to dwell in her—
ISA.1.21	but now murderers!
ISA.1.22	Your silver has become dross,
ISA.1.22	your choice wine is diluted with water.
ISA.1.23	Your rulers are rebels,
ISA.1.23	partners with thieves;
ISA.1.23	they all love bribes
ISA.1.23	and chase after gifts.
ISA.1.23	They do not defend the cause of the fatherless;
ISA.1.23	the widow’s case does not come before them.
ISA.1.24	Therefore the Lord, the 
ISA.1.24	the Mighty One of Israel, declares:
ISA.1.24	“Ah! I will vent my wrath on my foes
ISA.1.24	and avenge myself on my enemies.
ISA.1.25	I will turn my hand against you;
ISA.1.25	I will thoroughly purge away your dross
ISA.1.25	and remove all your impurities.
ISA.1.26	I will restore your leaders as in days of old,
ISA.1.26	your rulers as at the beginning.
ISA.1.26	Afterward you will be called
ISA.1.26	the City of Righteousness,
ISA.1.26	the Faithful City.”
ISA.1.27	Zion will be delivered with justice,
ISA.1.27	her penitent ones with righteousness.
ISA.1.28	But rebels and sinners will both be broken,
ISA.1.28	and those who forsake the 
ISA.1.29	“You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks
ISA.1.29	in which you have delighted;
ISA.1.29	you will be disgraced because of the gardens
ISA.1.29	that you have chosen.
ISA.1.30	You will be like an oak with fading leaves,
ISA.1.30	like a garden without water.
ISA.1.31	The mighty man will become tinder
ISA.1.31	and his work a spark;
ISA.1.31	both will burn together,
ISA.1.31	with no one to quench the fire.”
ISA.2.1	This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
ISA.2.2	In the last days
ISA.2.2	the mountain of the 
ISA.2.2	as the highest of the mountains;
ISA.2.2	it will be exalted above the hills,
ISA.2.2	and all nations will stream to it.
ISA.2.3	Many peoples will come and say,
ISA.2.3	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.3	to the temple of the God of Jacob.
ISA.2.3	He will teach us his ways,
ISA.2.3	so that we may walk in his paths.”
ISA.2.3	The law will go out from Zion,
ISA.2.3	the word of the 
ISA.2.4	He will judge between the nations
ISA.2.4	and will settle disputes for many peoples.
ISA.2.4	They will beat their swords into plowshares
ISA.2.4	and their spears into pruning hooks.
ISA.2.4	Nation will not take up sword against nation,
ISA.2.4	nor will they train for war anymore.
ISA.2.5	Come, descendants of Jacob,
ISA.2.5	let us walk in the light of the 
ISA.2.6	You, 
ISA.2.6	the descendants of Jacob.
ISA.2.6	They are full of superstitions from the East;
ISA.2.6	they practice divination like the Philistines
ISA.2.6	and embrace pagan customs.
ISA.2.7	Their land is full of silver and gold;
ISA.2.7	there is no end to their treasures.
ISA.2.7	Their land is full of horses;
ISA.2.7	there is no end to their chariots.
ISA.2.8	Their land is full of idols;
ISA.2.8	they bow down to the work of their hands,
ISA.2.8	to what their fingers have made.
ISA.2.9	So people will be brought low
ISA.2.9	and everyone humbled—
ISA.2.9	do not forgive them.
ISA.2.10	Go into the rocks, hide in the ground
ISA.2.10	from the fearful presence of the 
ISA.2.10	and the splendor of his majesty!
ISA.2.11	The eyes of the arrogant will be humbled
ISA.2.11	and human pride brought low;
ISA.2.11	the 
ISA.2.12	The 
ISA.2.12	for all the proud and lofty,
ISA.2.12	for all that is exalted
ISA.2.12	(and they will be humbled),
ISA.2.13	for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty,
ISA.2.13	and all the oaks of Bashan,
ISA.2.14	for all the towering mountains
ISA.2.14	and all the high hills,
ISA.2.15	for every lofty tower
ISA.2.15	and every fortified wall,
ISA.2.16	for every trading ship
ISA.2.16	and every stately vessel.
ISA.2.17	The arrogance of man will be brought low
ISA.2.17	and human pride humbled;
ISA.2.17	the 
ISA.2.18	and the idols will totally disappear.
ISA.2.19	People will flee to caves in the rocks
ISA.2.19	and to holes in the ground
ISA.2.19	from the fearful presence of the 
ISA.2.19	and the splendor of his majesty,
ISA.2.19	when he rises to shake the earth.
ISA.2.20	In that day people will throw away
ISA.2.20	to the moles and bats
ISA.2.20	their idols of silver and idols of gold,
ISA.2.20	which they made to worship.
ISA.2.21	They will flee to caverns in the rocks
ISA.2.21	and to the overhanging crags
ISA.2.21	from the fearful presence of the 
ISA.2.21	and the splendor of his majesty,
ISA.2.21	when he rises to shake the earth.
ISA.2.22	Stop trusting in mere humans,
ISA.2.22	who have but a breath in their nostrils.
ISA.2.22	Why hold them in esteem?
ISA.3.1	See now, the Lord,
ISA.3.1	the 
ISA.3.1	is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah
ISA.3.1	both supply and support:
ISA.3.1	all supplies of food and all supplies of water,
ISA.3.2	the hero and the warrior,
ISA.3.2	the judge and the prophet,
ISA.3.2	the diviner and the elder,
ISA.3.3	the captain of fifty and the man of rank,
ISA.3.3	the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.
ISA.3.4	“I will make mere youths their officials;
ISA.3.4	children will rule over them.”
ISA.3.5	People will oppress each other—
ISA.3.5	man against man, neighbor against neighbor.
ISA.3.5	The young will rise up against the old,
ISA.3.5	the nobody against the honored.
ISA.3.6	A man will seize one of his brothers
ISA.3.6	in his father’s house, and say,
ISA.3.6	“You have a cloak, you be our leader;
ISA.3.6	take charge of this heap of ruins!”
ISA.3.7	But in that day he will cry out,
ISA.3.7	“I have no remedy.
ISA.3.7	I have no food or clothing in my house;
ISA.3.7	do not make me the leader of the people.”
ISA.3.8	Jerusalem staggers,
ISA.3.8	Judah is falling;
ISA.3.8	their words and deeds are against the 
ISA.3.8	defying his glorious presence.
ISA.3.9	The look on their faces testifies against them;
ISA.3.9	they parade their sin like Sodom;
ISA.3.9	they do not hide it.
ISA.3.9	Woe to them!
ISA.3.9	They have brought disaster upon themselves.
ISA.3.10	Tell the righteous it will be well with them,
ISA.3.10	for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.
ISA.3.11	Woe to the wicked!
ISA.3.11	Disaster is upon them!
ISA.3.11	They will be paid back
ISA.3.11	for what their hands have done.
ISA.3.12	Youths oppress my people,
ISA.3.12	women rule over them.
ISA.3.12	My people, your guides lead you astray;
ISA.3.12	they turn you from the path.
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.13	he rises to judge the people.
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.14	against the elders and leaders of his people:
ISA.3.14	“It is you who have ruined my vineyard;
ISA.3.14	the plunder from the poor is in your houses.
ISA.3.15	What do you mean by crushing my people
ISA.3.15	and grinding the faces of the poor?”
ISA.3.15	declares the Lord, the 
ISA.3.16	The 
ISA.3.16	“The women of Zion are haughty,
ISA.3.16	walking along with outstretched necks,
ISA.3.16	flirting with their eyes,
ISA.3.16	strutting along with swaying hips,
ISA.3.16	with ornaments jingling on their ankles.
ISA.3.17	Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion;
ISA.3.17	the 
ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces, 
ISA.3.19	the earrings and bracelets and veils, 
ISA.3.20	the headdresses and anklets and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms, 
ISA.3.21	the signet rings and nose rings, 
ISA.3.22	the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses 
ISA.3.23	and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.
ISA.3.24	Instead of fragrance there will be a stench;
ISA.3.24	instead of a sash, a rope;
ISA.3.24	instead of well-dressed hair, baldness;
ISA.3.24	instead of fine clothing, sackcloth;
ISA.3.24	instead of beauty, branding.
ISA.3.25	Your men will fall by the sword,
ISA.3.25	your warriors in battle.
ISA.3.26	The gates of Zion will lament and mourn;
ISA.3.26	destitute, she will sit on the ground.
ISA.4.1	In that day seven women
ISA.4.1	will take hold of one man
ISA.4.1	and say, “We will eat our own food
ISA.4.1	and provide our own clothes;
ISA.4.1	only let us be called by your name.
ISA.4.1	Take away our disgrace!”
ISA.4.2	In that day the Branch of the 
ISA.4.3	Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem. 
ISA.4.4	The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit
ISA.4.5	Then the 
ISA.4.6	It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.
ISA.5.1	I will sing for the one I love
ISA.5.1	a song about his vineyard:
ISA.5.1	My loved one had a vineyard
ISA.5.1	on a fertile hillside.
ISA.5.2	He dug it up and cleared it of stones
ISA.5.2	and planted it with the choicest vines.
ISA.5.2	He built a watchtower in it
ISA.5.2	and cut out a winepress as well.
ISA.5.2	Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,
ISA.5.2	but it yielded only bad fruit.
ISA.5.3	“Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and people of Judah,
ISA.5.3	judge between me and my vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What more could have been done for my vineyard
ISA.5.4	than I have done for it?
ISA.5.4	When I looked for good grapes,
ISA.5.4	why did it yield only bad?
ISA.5.5	Now I will tell you
ISA.5.5	what I am going to do to my vineyard:
ISA.5.5	I will take away its hedge,
ISA.5.5	and it will be destroyed;
ISA.5.5	I will break down its wall,
ISA.5.5	and it will be trampled.
ISA.5.6	I will make it a wasteland,
ISA.5.6	neither pruned nor cultivated,
ISA.5.6	and briers and thorns will grow there.
ISA.5.6	I will command the clouds
ISA.5.6	not to rain on it.”
ISA.5.7	The vineyard of the 
ISA.5.7	is the nation of Israel,
ISA.5.7	and the people of Judah
ISA.5.7	are the vines he delighted in.
ISA.5.7	And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed;
ISA.5.7	for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.
ISA.5.8	Woe to you who add house to house
ISA.5.8	and join field to field
ISA.5.8	till no space is left
ISA.5.8	and you live alone in the land.
ISA.5.9	The 
ISA.5.9	“Surely the great houses will become desolate,
ISA.5.9	the fine mansions left without occupants.
ISA.5.10	A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath
ISA.5.10	a homer
ISA.5.11	Woe to those who rise early in the morning
ISA.5.11	to run after their drinks,
ISA.5.11	who stay up late at night
ISA.5.11	till they are inflamed with wine.
ISA.5.12	They have harps and lyres at their banquets,
ISA.5.12	pipes and timbrels and wine,
ISA.5.12	but they have no regard for the deeds of the 
ISA.5.12	no respect for the work of his hands.
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people will go into exile
ISA.5.13	for lack of understanding;
ISA.5.13	those of high rank will die of hunger
ISA.5.13	and the common people will be parched with thirst.
ISA.5.14	Therefore Death expands its jaws,
ISA.5.14	opening wide its mouth;
ISA.5.14	into it will descend their nobles and masses
ISA.5.14	with all their brawlers and revelers.
ISA.5.15	So people will be brought low
ISA.5.15	and everyone humbled,
ISA.5.15	the eyes of the arrogant humbled.
ISA.5.16	But the 
ISA.5.16	and the holy God will be proved holy by his righteous acts.
ISA.5.17	Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture;
ISA.5.17	lambs will feed
ISA.5.18	Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit,
ISA.5.18	and wickedness as with cart ropes,
ISA.5.19	to those who say, “Let God hurry;
ISA.5.19	let him hasten his work
ISA.5.19	so we may see it.
ISA.5.19	The plan of the Holy One of Israel—
ISA.5.19	let it approach, let it come into view,
ISA.5.19	so we may know it.”
ISA.5.20	Woe to those who call evil good
ISA.5.20	and good evil,
ISA.5.20	who put darkness for light
ISA.5.20	and light for darkness,
ISA.5.20	who put bitter for sweet
ISA.5.20	and sweet for bitter.
ISA.5.21	Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes
ISA.5.21	and clever in their own sight.
ISA.5.22	Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine
ISA.5.22	and champions at mixing drinks,
ISA.5.23	who acquit the guilty for a bribe,
ISA.5.23	but deny justice to the innocent.
ISA.5.24	Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw
ISA.5.24	and as dry grass sinks down in the flames,
ISA.5.24	so their roots will decay
ISA.5.24	and their flowers blow away like dust;
ISA.5.24	for they have rejected the law of the 
ISA.5.24	and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.5.25	Therefore the 
ISA.5.25	his hand is raised and he strikes them down.
ISA.5.25	The mountains shake,
ISA.5.25	and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets.
ISA.5.25	Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,
ISA.5.25	his hand is still upraised.
ISA.5.26	He lifts up a banner for the distant nations,
ISA.5.26	he whistles for those at the ends of the earth.
ISA.5.26	Here they come,
ISA.5.26	swiftly and speedily!
ISA.5.27	Not one of them grows tired or stumbles,
ISA.5.27	not one slumbers or sleeps;
ISA.5.27	not a belt is loosened at the waist,
ISA.5.27	not a sandal strap is broken.
ISA.5.28	Their arrows are sharp,
ISA.5.28	all their bows are strung;
ISA.5.28	their horses’ hooves seem like flint,
ISA.5.28	their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.
ISA.5.29	Their roar is like that of the lion,
ISA.5.29	they roar like young lions;
ISA.5.29	they growl as they seize their prey
ISA.5.29	and carry it off with no one to rescue.
ISA.5.30	In that day they will roar over it
ISA.5.30	like the roaring of the sea.
ISA.5.30	And if one looks at the land,
ISA.5.30	there is only darkness and distress;
ISA.5.30	even the sun will be darkened by clouds.
ISA.6.1	In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple. 
ISA.6.2	Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. 
ISA.6.3	And they were calling to one another:
ISA.6.3	“Holy, holy, holy is the 
ISA.6.3	the whole earth is full of his glory.”
ISA.6.4	At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.
ISA.6.5	“Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the 
ISA.6.6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. 
ISA.6.7	With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.”
ISA.6.8	Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?”
ISA.6.8	And I said, “Here am I. Send me!”
ISA.6.9	He said, “Go and tell this people:
ISA.6.9	“ ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding;
ISA.6.9	be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people calloused;
ISA.6.10	make their ears dull
ISA.6.10	and close their eyes.
ISA.6.10	Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
ISA.6.10	hear with their ears,
ISA.6.10	understand with their hearts,
ISA.6.10	and turn and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	Then I said, “For how long, Lord?”
ISA.6.11	And he answered:
ISA.6.11	“Until the cities lie ruined
ISA.6.11	and without inhabitant,
ISA.6.11	until the houses are left deserted
ISA.6.11	and the fields ruined and ravaged,
ISA.6.12	until the 
ISA.6.12	and the land is utterly forsaken.
ISA.6.13	And though a tenth remains in the land,
ISA.6.13	it will again be laid waste.
ISA.6.13	But as the terebinth and oak
ISA.6.13	leave stumps when they are cut down,
ISA.6.13	so the holy seed will be the stump in the land.”
ISA.7.1	When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.
ISA.7.2	Now the house of David was told, “Aram has allied itself with
ISA.7.3	Then the 
ISA.7.4	Say to him, ‘Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah. 
ISA.7.5	Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah’s son have plotted your ruin, saying, 
ISA.7.6	“Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it.” 
ISA.7.7	Yet this is what the Sovereign 
ISA.7.7	“ ‘It will not take place,
ISA.7.7	it will not happen,
ISA.7.8	for the head of Aram is Damascus,
ISA.7.8	and the head of Damascus is only Rezin.
ISA.7.8	Within sixty-five years
ISA.7.8	Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.
ISA.7.9	The head of Ephraim is Samaria,
ISA.7.9	and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah’s son.
ISA.7.9	If you do not stand firm in your faith,
ISA.7.9	you will not stand at all.’ ”
ISA.7.10	Again the 
ISA.7.11	“Ask the 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the 
ISA.7.13	Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also? 
ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord himself will give you
ISA.7.15	He will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, 
ISA.7.16	for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste. 
ISA.7.17	The 
ISA.7.18	In that day the 
ISA.7.19	They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes. 
ISA.7.20	In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—to shave your heads and private parts, and to cut off your beards also. 
ISA.7.21	In that day, a person will keep alive a young cow and two goats. 
ISA.7.22	And because of the abundance of the milk they give, there will be curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey. 
ISA.7.23	In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels,
ISA.7.24	Hunters will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns. 
ISA.7.25	As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.
ISA.8.1	The 
ISA.8.2	So I called in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me. 
ISA.8.3	Then I made love to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the 
ISA.8.4	For before the boy knows how to say ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	“Because this people has rejected
ISA.8.6	the gently flowing waters of Shiloah
ISA.8.6	and rejoices over Rezin
ISA.8.6	and the son of Remaliah,
ISA.8.7	therefore the Lord is about to bring against them
ISA.8.7	the mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates—
ISA.8.7	the king of Assyria with all his pomp.
ISA.8.7	It will overflow all its channels,
ISA.8.7	run over all its banks
ISA.8.8	and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it,
ISA.8.8	passing through it and reaching up to the neck.
ISA.8.8	Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land,
ISA.8.8	Immanuel
ISA.8.9	Raise the war cry,
ISA.8.9	Listen, all you distant lands.
ISA.8.9	Prepare for battle, and be shattered!
ISA.8.9	Prepare for battle, and be shattered!
ISA.8.10	Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted;
ISA.8.10	propose your plan, but it will not stand,
ISA.8.10	for God is with us.
ISA.8.11	This is what the 
ISA.8.12	“Do not call conspiracy
ISA.8.12	everything this people calls a conspiracy;
ISA.8.12	do not fear what they fear,
ISA.8.12	and do not dread it.
ISA.8.13	The 
ISA.8.13	he is the one you are to fear,
ISA.8.13	he is the one you are to dread.
ISA.8.14	He will be a holy place;
ISA.8.14	for both Israel and Judah he will be
ISA.8.14	a stone that causes people to stumble
ISA.8.14	and a rock that makes them fall.
ISA.8.14	And for the people of Jerusalem he will be
ISA.8.14	a trap and a snare.
ISA.8.15	Many of them will stumble;
ISA.8.15	they will fall and be broken,
ISA.8.15	they will be snared and captured.”
ISA.8.16	Bind up this testimony of warning
ISA.8.16	and seal up God’s instruction among my disciples.
ISA.8.17	I will wait for the 
ISA.8.17	who is hiding his face from the descendants of Jacob.
ISA.8.17	I will put my trust in him.
ISA.8.18	Here am I, and the children the 
ISA.8.19	When someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living? 
ISA.8.20	Consult God’s instruction and the testimony of warning. If anyone does not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn. 
ISA.8.21	Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God. 
ISA.8.22	Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.
ISA.9.1	Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan—
ISA.9.2	The people walking in darkness
ISA.9.2	have seen a great light;
ISA.9.2	on those living in the land of deep darkness
ISA.9.2	a light has dawned.
ISA.9.3	You have enlarged the nation
ISA.9.3	and increased their joy;
ISA.9.3	they rejoice before you
ISA.9.3	as people rejoice at the harvest,
ISA.9.3	as warriors rejoice
ISA.9.3	when dividing the plunder.
ISA.9.4	For as in the day of Midian’s defeat,
ISA.9.4	you have shattered
ISA.9.4	the yoke that burdens them,
ISA.9.4	the bar across their shoulders,
ISA.9.4	the rod of their oppressor.
ISA.9.5	Every warrior’s boot used in battle
ISA.9.5	and every garment rolled in blood
ISA.9.5	will be destined for burning,
ISA.9.5	will be fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.6	For to us a child is born,
ISA.9.6	to us a son is given,
ISA.9.6	and the government will be on his shoulders.
ISA.9.6	And he will be called
ISA.9.6	Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
ISA.9.6	Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
ISA.9.7	Of the greatness of his government and peace
ISA.9.7	there will be no end.
ISA.9.7	He will reign on David’s throne
ISA.9.7	and over his kingdom,
ISA.9.7	establishing and upholding it
ISA.9.7	with justice and righteousness
ISA.9.7	from that time on and forever.
ISA.9.7	The zeal of the 
ISA.9.7	will accomplish this.
ISA.9.8	The Lord has sent a message against Jacob;
ISA.9.8	it will fall on Israel.
ISA.9.9	All the people will know it—
ISA.9.9	Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria—
ISA.9.9	who say with pride
ISA.9.9	and arrogance of heart,
ISA.9.10	“The bricks have fallen down,
ISA.9.10	but we will rebuild with dressed stone;
ISA.9.10	the fig trees have been felled,
ISA.9.10	but we will replace them with cedars.”
ISA.9.11	But the 
ISA.9.11	and has spurred their enemies on.
ISA.9.12	Arameans from the east and Philistines from the west
ISA.9.12	have devoured Israel with open mouth.
ISA.9.12	Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,
ISA.9.12	his hand is still upraised.
ISA.9.13	But the people have not returned to him who struck them,
ISA.9.13	nor have they sought the 
ISA.9.14	So the 
ISA.9.14	both palm branch and reed in a single day;
ISA.9.15	the elders and dignitaries are the head,
ISA.9.15	the prophets who teach lies are the tail.
ISA.9.16	Those who guide this people mislead them,
ISA.9.16	and those who are guided are led astray.
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in the young men,
ISA.9.17	nor will he pity the fatherless and widows,
ISA.9.17	for everyone is ungodly and wicked,
ISA.9.17	every mouth speaks folly.
ISA.9.17	Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,
ISA.9.17	his hand is still upraised.
ISA.9.18	Surely wickedness burns like a fire;
ISA.9.18	it consumes briers and thorns,
ISA.9.18	it sets the forest thickets ablaze,
ISA.9.18	so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke.
ISA.9.19	By the wrath of the 
ISA.9.19	the land will be scorched
ISA.9.19	and the people will be fuel for the fire;
ISA.9.19	they will not spare one another.
ISA.9.20	On the right they will devour,
ISA.9.20	but still be hungry;
ISA.9.20	on the left they will eat,
ISA.9.20	but not be satisfied.
ISA.9.20	Each will feed on the flesh of their own offspring
ISA.9.21	Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, and Ephraim on Manasseh;
ISA.9.21	together they will turn against Judah.
ISA.9.21	Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,
ISA.9.21	his hand is still upraised.
ISA.10.1	Woe to those who make unjust laws,
ISA.10.1	to those who issue oppressive decrees,
ISA.10.2	to deprive the poor of their rights
ISA.10.2	and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people,
ISA.10.2	making widows their prey
ISA.10.2	and robbing the fatherless.
ISA.10.3	What will you do on the day of reckoning,
ISA.10.3	when disaster comes from afar?
ISA.10.3	To whom will you run for help?
ISA.10.3	Where will you leave your riches?
ISA.10.4	Nothing will remain but to cringe among the captives
ISA.10.4	or fall among the slain.
ISA.10.4	Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,
ISA.10.4	his hand is still upraised.
ISA.10.5	“Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of my anger,
ISA.10.5	in whose hand is the club of my wrath!
ISA.10.6	I send him against a godless nation,
ISA.10.6	I dispatch him against a people who anger me,
ISA.10.6	to seize loot and snatch plunder,
ISA.10.6	and to trample them down like mud in the streets.
ISA.10.7	But this is not what he intends,
ISA.10.7	this is not what he has in mind;
ISA.10.7	his purpose is to destroy,
ISA.10.7	to put an end to many nations.
ISA.10.8	‘Are not my commanders all kings?’ he says.
ISA.10.9	‘Has not Kalno fared like Carchemish?
ISA.10.9	Is not Hamath like Arpad,
ISA.10.9	and Samaria like Damascus?
ISA.10.10	As my hand seized the kingdoms of the idols,
ISA.10.10	kingdoms whose images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria—
ISA.10.11	shall I not deal with Jerusalem and her images
ISA.10.11	as I dealt with Samaria and her idols?’ ”
ISA.10.12	When the Lord has finished all his work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, he will say, “I will punish the king of Assyria for the willful pride of his heart and the haughty look in his eyes. 
ISA.10.13	For he says:
ISA.10.13	“ ‘By the strength of my hand I have done this,
ISA.10.13	and by my wisdom, because I have understanding.
ISA.10.13	I removed the boundaries of nations,
ISA.10.13	I plundered their treasures;
ISA.10.13	like a mighty one I subdued
ISA.10.14	As one reaches into a nest,
ISA.10.14	so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations;
ISA.10.14	as people gather abandoned eggs,
ISA.10.14	so I gathered all the countries;
ISA.10.14	not one flapped a wing,
ISA.10.14	or opened its mouth to chirp.’ ”
ISA.10.15	Does the ax raise itself above the person who swings it,
ISA.10.15	or the saw boast against the one who uses it?
ISA.10.15	As if a rod were to wield the person who lifts it up,
ISA.10.15	or a club brandish the one who is not wood!
ISA.10.16	Therefore, the Lord, the 
ISA.10.16	will send a wasting disease upon his sturdy warriors;
ISA.10.16	under his pomp a fire will be kindled
ISA.10.16	like a blazing flame.
ISA.10.17	The Light of Israel will become a fire,
ISA.10.17	their Holy One a flame;
ISA.10.17	in a single day it will burn and consume
ISA.10.17	his thorns and his briers.
ISA.10.18	The splendor of his forests and fertile fields
ISA.10.18	it will completely destroy,
ISA.10.18	as when a sick person wastes away.
ISA.10.19	And the remaining trees of his forests will be so few
ISA.10.19	that a child could write them down.
ISA.10.20	In that day the remnant of Israel,
ISA.10.20	the survivors of Jacob,
ISA.10.20	will no longer rely on him
ISA.10.20	who struck them down
ISA.10.20	but will truly rely on the 
ISA.10.20	the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.10.21	A remnant will return,
ISA.10.21	will return to the Mighty God.
ISA.10.22	Though your people be like the sand by the sea, Israel,
ISA.10.22	only a remnant will return.
ISA.10.22	Destruction has been decreed,
ISA.10.22	overwhelming and righteous.
ISA.10.23	The Lord, the 
ISA.10.23	the destruction decreed upon the whole land.
ISA.10.24	Therefore this is what the Lord, the 
ISA.10.24	“My people who live in Zion,
ISA.10.24	do not be afraid of the Assyrians,
ISA.10.24	who beat you with a rod
ISA.10.24	and lift up a club against you, as Egypt did.
ISA.10.25	Very soon my anger against you will end
ISA.10.25	and my wrath will be directed to their destruction.”
ISA.10.26	The 
ISA.10.26	as when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb;
ISA.10.26	and he will raise his staff over the waters,
ISA.10.26	as he did in Egypt.
ISA.10.27	In that day their burden will be lifted from your shoulders,
ISA.10.27	their yoke from your neck;
ISA.10.27	the yoke will be broken
ISA.10.27	because you have grown so fat.
ISA.10.28	They enter Aiath;
ISA.10.28	they pass through Migron;
ISA.10.28	they store supplies at Mikmash.
ISA.10.29	They go over the pass, and say,
ISA.10.29	“We will camp overnight at Geba.”
ISA.10.29	Ramah trembles;
ISA.10.29	Gibeah of Saul flees.
ISA.10.30	Cry out, Daughter Gallim!
ISA.10.30	Listen, Laishah!
ISA.10.30	Poor Anathoth!
ISA.10.31	Madmenah is in flight;
ISA.10.31	the people of Gebim take cover.
ISA.10.32	This day they will halt at Nob;
ISA.10.32	they will shake their fist
ISA.10.32	at the mount of Daughter Zion,
ISA.10.32	at the hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	See, the Lord, the 
ISA.10.33	will lop off the boughs with great power.
ISA.10.33	The lofty trees will be felled,
ISA.10.33	the tall ones will be brought low.
ISA.10.34	He will cut down the forest thickets with an ax;
ISA.10.34	Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.
ISA.11.1	A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse;
ISA.11.1	from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of the 
ISA.11.2	the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,
ISA.11.2	the Spirit of counsel and of might,
ISA.11.2	the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the 
ISA.11.3	and he will delight in the fear of the 
ISA.11.3	He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes,
ISA.11.3	or decide by what he hears with his ears;
ISA.11.4	but with righteousness he will judge the needy,
ISA.11.4	with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth.
ISA.11.4	He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth;
ISA.11.4	with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.
ISA.11.5	Righteousness will be his belt
ISA.11.5	and faithfulness the sash around his waist.
ISA.11.6	The wolf will live with the lamb,
ISA.11.6	the leopard will lie down with the goat,
ISA.11.6	the calf and the lion and the yearling
ISA.11.6	and a little child will lead them.
ISA.11.7	The cow will feed with the bear,
ISA.11.7	their young will lie down together,
ISA.11.7	and the lion will eat straw like the ox.
ISA.11.8	The infant will play near the cobra’s den,
ISA.11.8	and the young child will put its hand into the viper’s nest.
ISA.11.9	They will neither harm nor destroy
ISA.11.9	on all my holy mountain,
ISA.11.9	for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the 
ISA.11.9	as the waters cover the sea.
ISA.11.10	In that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious. 
ISA.11.11	In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the surviving remnant of his people from Assyria, from Lower Egypt, from Upper Egypt, from Cush,
ISA.11.12	He will raise a banner for the nations
ISA.11.12	and gather the exiles of Israel;
ISA.11.12	he will assemble the scattered people of Judah
ISA.11.12	from the four quarters of the earth.
ISA.11.13	Ephraim’s jealousy will vanish,
ISA.11.13	and Judah’s enemies
ISA.11.13	Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah,
ISA.11.13	nor Judah hostile toward Ephraim.
ISA.11.14	They will swoop down on the slopes of Philistia to the west;
ISA.11.14	together they will plunder the people to the east.
ISA.11.14	They will subdue Edom and Moab,
ISA.11.14	and the Ammonites will be subject to them.
ISA.11.15	The 
ISA.11.15	the gulf of the Egyptian sea;
ISA.11.15	with a scorching wind he will sweep his hand
ISA.11.15	over the Euphrates River.
ISA.11.15	He will break it up into seven streams
ISA.11.15	so that anyone can cross over in sandals.
ISA.11.16	There will be a highway for the remnant of his people
ISA.11.16	that is left from Assyria,
ISA.11.16	as there was for Israel
ISA.11.16	when they came up from Egypt.
ISA.12.1	In that day you will say:
ISA.12.1	“I will praise you, 
ISA.12.1	Although you were angry with me,
ISA.12.1	your anger has turned away
ISA.12.1	and you have comforted me.
ISA.12.2	Surely God is my salvation;
ISA.12.2	I will trust and not be afraid.
ISA.12.2	The 
ISA.12.2	he has become my salvation.”
ISA.12.3	With joy you will draw water
ISA.12.3	from the wells of salvation.
ISA.12.4	In that day you will say:
ISA.12.4	“Give praise to the 
ISA.12.4	make known among the nations what he has done,
ISA.12.4	and proclaim that his name is exalted.
ISA.12.5	Sing to the 
ISA.12.5	let this be known to all the world.
ISA.12.6	Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion,
ISA.12.6	for great is the Holy One of Israel among you.”
ISA.13.1	A prophecy against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:
ISA.13.2	Raise a banner on a bare hilltop,
ISA.13.2	shout to them;
ISA.13.2	beckon to them
ISA.13.2	to enter the gates of the nobles.
ISA.13.3	I have commanded those I prepared for battle;
ISA.13.3	I have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath—
ISA.13.3	those who rejoice in my triumph.
ISA.13.4	Listen, a noise on the mountains,
ISA.13.4	like that of a great multitude!
ISA.13.4	Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms,
ISA.13.4	like nations massing together!
ISA.13.4	The 
ISA.13.4	an army for war.
ISA.13.5	They come from faraway lands,
ISA.13.5	from the ends of the heavens—
ISA.13.5	the 
ISA.13.5	to destroy the whole country.
ISA.13.6	Wail, for the day of the 
ISA.13.6	it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
ISA.13.7	Because of this, all hands will go limp,
ISA.13.7	every heart will melt with fear.
ISA.13.8	Terror will seize them,
ISA.13.8	pain and anguish will grip them;
ISA.13.8	they will writhe like a woman in labor.
ISA.13.8	They will look aghast at each other,
ISA.13.8	their faces aflame.
ISA.13.9	See, the day of the 
ISA.13.9	—a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger—
ISA.13.9	to make the land desolate
ISA.13.9	and destroy the sinners within it.
ISA.13.10	The stars of heaven and their constellations
ISA.13.10	will not show their light.
ISA.13.10	The rising sun will be darkened
ISA.13.10	and the moon will not give its light.
ISA.13.11	I will punish the world for its evil,
ISA.13.11	the wicked for their sins.
ISA.13.11	I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty
ISA.13.11	and will humble the pride of the ruthless.
ISA.13.12	I will make people scarcer than pure gold,
ISA.13.12	more rare than the gold of Ophir.
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble;
ISA.13.13	and the earth will shake from its place
ISA.13.13	at the wrath of the 
ISA.13.13	in the day of his burning anger.
ISA.13.14	Like a hunted gazelle,
ISA.13.14	like sheep without a shepherd,
ISA.13.14	they will all return to their own people,
ISA.13.14	they will flee to their native land.
ISA.13.15	Whoever is captured will be thrust through;
ISA.13.15	all who are caught will fall by the sword.
ISA.13.16	Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes;
ISA.13.16	their houses will be looted and their wives violated.
ISA.13.17	See, I will stir up against them the Medes,
ISA.13.17	who do not care for silver
ISA.13.17	and have no delight in gold.
ISA.13.18	Their bows will strike down the young men;
ISA.13.18	they will have no mercy on infants,
ISA.13.18	nor will they look with compassion on children.
ISA.13.19	Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms,
ISA.13.19	the pride and glory of the Babylonians,
ISA.13.19	will be overthrown by God
ISA.13.19	like Sodom and Gomorrah.
ISA.13.20	She will never be inhabited
ISA.13.20	or lived in through all generations;
ISA.13.20	there no nomads will pitch their tents,
ISA.13.20	there no shepherds will rest their flocks.
ISA.13.21	But desert creatures will lie there,
ISA.13.21	jackals will fill her houses;
ISA.13.21	there the owls will dwell,
ISA.13.21	and there the wild goats will leap about.
ISA.13.22	Hyenas will inhabit her strongholds,
ISA.13.22	jackals her luxurious palaces.
ISA.13.22	Her time is at hand,
ISA.13.22	and her days will not be prolonged.
ISA.14.1	The 
ISA.14.1	once again he will choose Israel
ISA.14.1	and will settle them in their own land.
ISA.14.1	Foreigners will join them
ISA.14.1	and unite with the descendants of Jacob.
ISA.14.2	Nations will take them
ISA.14.2	and bring them to their own place.
ISA.14.2	And Israel will take possession of the nations
ISA.14.2	and make them male and female servants in the 
ISA.14.2	They will make captives of their captors
ISA.14.2	and rule over their oppressors.
ISA.14.3	On the day the 
ISA.14.4	you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon:
ISA.14.4	How the oppressor has come to an end!
ISA.14.4	How his fury
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.5	the scepter of the rulers,
ISA.14.6	which in anger struck down peoples
ISA.14.6	with unceasing blows,
ISA.14.6	and in fury subdued nations
ISA.14.6	with relentless aggression.
ISA.14.7	All the lands are at rest and at peace;
ISA.14.7	they break into singing.
ISA.14.8	Even the junipers and the cedars of Lebanon
ISA.14.8	gloat over you and say,
ISA.14.8	“Now that you have been laid low,
ISA.14.8	no one comes to cut us down.”
ISA.14.9	The realm of the dead below is all astir
ISA.14.9	to meet you at your coming;
ISA.14.9	it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you—
ISA.14.9	all those who were leaders in the world;
ISA.14.9	it makes them rise from their thrones—
ISA.14.9	all those who were kings over the nations.
ISA.14.10	They will all respond,
ISA.14.10	they will say to you,
ISA.14.10	“You also have become weak, as we are;
ISA.14.10	you have become like us.”
ISA.14.11	All your pomp has been brought down to the grave,
ISA.14.11	along with the noise of your harps;
ISA.14.11	maggots are spread out beneath you
ISA.14.11	and worms cover you.
ISA.14.12	How you have fallen from heaven,
ISA.14.12	morning star, son of the dawn!
ISA.14.12	You have been cast down to the earth,
ISA.14.12	you who once laid low the nations!
ISA.14.13	You said in your heart,
ISA.14.13	“I will ascend to the heavens;
ISA.14.13	I will raise my throne
ISA.14.13	above the stars of God;
ISA.14.13	I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly,
ISA.14.13	on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon.
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the tops of the clouds;
ISA.14.14	I will make myself like the Most High.”
ISA.14.15	But you are brought down to the realm of the dead,
ISA.14.15	to the depths of the pit.
ISA.14.16	Those who see you stare at you,
ISA.14.16	they ponder your fate:
ISA.14.16	“Is this the man who shook the earth
ISA.14.16	and made kingdoms tremble,
ISA.14.17	the man who made the world a wilderness,
ISA.14.17	who overthrew its cities
ISA.14.17	and would not let his captives go home?”
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations lie in state,
ISA.14.18	each in his own tomb.
ISA.14.19	But you are cast out of your tomb
ISA.14.19	like a rejected branch;
ISA.14.19	you are covered with the slain,
ISA.14.19	with those pierced by the sword,
ISA.14.19	those who descend to the stones of the pit.
ISA.14.19	Like a corpse trampled underfoot,
ISA.14.20	you will not join them in burial,
ISA.14.20	for you have destroyed your land
ISA.14.20	and killed your people.
ISA.14.20	Let the offspring of the wicked
ISA.14.20	never be mentioned again.
ISA.14.21	Prepare a place to slaughter his children
ISA.14.21	for the sins of their ancestors;
ISA.14.21	they are not to rise to inherit the land
ISA.14.21	and cover the earth with their cities.
ISA.14.22	“I will rise up against them,”
ISA.14.22	declares the 
ISA.14.22	“I will wipe out Babylon’s name and survivors,
ISA.14.22	her offspring and descendants,”
ISA.14.22	declares the 
ISA.14.23	“I will turn her into a place for owls
ISA.14.23	and into swampland;
ISA.14.23	I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,”
ISA.14.23	declares the 
ISA.14.24	The 
ISA.14.24	“Surely, as I have planned, so it will be,
ISA.14.24	and as I have purposed, so it will happen.
ISA.14.25	I will crush the Assyrian in my land;
ISA.14.25	on my mountains I will trample him down.
ISA.14.25	His yoke will be taken from my people,
ISA.14.25	and his burden removed from their shoulders.”
ISA.14.26	This is the plan determined for the whole world;
ISA.14.26	this is the hand stretched out over all nations.
ISA.14.27	For the 
ISA.14.27	His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?
ISA.14.28	This prophecy came in the year King Ahaz died:
ISA.14.29	Do not rejoice, all you Philistines,
ISA.14.29	that the rod that struck you is broken;
ISA.14.29	from the root of that snake will spring up a viper,
ISA.14.29	its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent.
ISA.14.30	The poorest of the poor will find pasture,
ISA.14.30	and the needy will lie down in safety.
ISA.14.30	But your root I will destroy by famine;
ISA.14.30	it will slay your survivors.
ISA.14.31	Wail, you gate! Howl, you city!
ISA.14.31	Melt away, all you Philistines!
ISA.14.31	A cloud of smoke comes from the north,
ISA.14.31	and there is not a straggler in its ranks.
ISA.14.32	What answer shall be given
ISA.14.32	to the envoys of that nation?
ISA.14.32	“The 
ISA.14.32	and in her his afflicted people will find refuge.”
ISA.15.1	A prophecy against Moab:
ISA.15.1	Ar in Moab is ruined,
ISA.15.1	destroyed in a night!
ISA.15.1	Kir in Moab is ruined,
ISA.15.1	destroyed in a night!
ISA.15.2	Dibon goes up to its temple,
ISA.15.2	to its high places to weep;
ISA.15.2	Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba.
ISA.15.2	Every head is shaved
ISA.15.2	and every beard cut off.
ISA.15.3	In the streets they wear sackcloth;
ISA.15.3	on the roofs and in the public squares
ISA.15.3	they all wail,
ISA.15.3	prostrate with weeping.
ISA.15.4	Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,
ISA.15.4	their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz.
ISA.15.4	Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out,
ISA.15.4	and their hearts are faint.
ISA.15.5	My heart cries out over Moab;
ISA.15.5	her fugitives flee as far as Zoar,
ISA.15.5	as far as Eglath Shelishiyah.
ISA.15.5	They go up the hill to Luhith,
ISA.15.5	weeping as they go;
ISA.15.5	on the road to Horonaim
ISA.15.5	they lament their destruction.
ISA.15.6	The waters of Nimrim are dried up
ISA.15.6	and the grass is withered;
ISA.15.6	the vegetation is gone
ISA.15.6	and nothing green is left.
ISA.15.7	So the wealth they have acquired and stored up
ISA.15.7	they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars.
ISA.15.8	Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab;
ISA.15.8	their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim,
ISA.15.8	their lamentation as far as Beer Elim.
ISA.15.9	The waters of Dimon
ISA.15.9	but I will bring still more upon Dimon
ISA.15.9	a lion upon the fugitives of Moab
ISA.15.9	and upon those who remain in the land.
ISA.16.1	Send lambs as tribute
ISA.16.1	to the ruler of the land,
ISA.16.1	from Sela, across the desert,
ISA.16.1	to the mount of Daughter Zion.
ISA.16.2	Like fluttering birds
ISA.16.2	pushed from the nest,
ISA.16.2	so are the women of Moab
ISA.16.2	at the fords of the Arnon.
ISA.16.3	“Make up your mind,” Moab says.
ISA.16.3	“Render a decision.
ISA.16.3	Make your shadow like night—
ISA.16.3	at high noon.
ISA.16.3	Hide the fugitives,
ISA.16.3	do not betray the refugees.
ISA.16.4	Let the Moabite fugitives stay with you;
ISA.16.4	be their shelter from the destroyer.”
ISA.16.4	The oppressor will come to an end,
ISA.16.4	and destruction will cease;
ISA.16.4	the aggressor will vanish from the land.
ISA.16.5	In love a throne will be established;
ISA.16.5	in faithfulness a man will sit on it—
ISA.16.5	one from the house
ISA.16.5	one who in judging seeks justice
ISA.16.5	and speeds the cause of righteousness.
ISA.16.6	We have heard of Moab’s pride—
ISA.16.6	how great is her arrogance!—
ISA.16.6	of her conceit, her pride and her insolence;
ISA.16.6	but her boasts are empty.
ISA.16.7	Therefore the Moabites wail,
ISA.16.7	they wail together for Moab.
ISA.16.7	Lament and grieve
ISA.16.7	for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.
ISA.16.8	The fields of Heshbon wither,
ISA.16.8	the vines of Sibmah also.
ISA.16.8	The rulers of the nations
ISA.16.8	have trampled down the choicest vines,
ISA.16.8	which once reached Jazer
ISA.16.8	and spread toward the desert.
ISA.16.8	Their shoots spread out
ISA.16.8	and went as far as the sea.
ISA.16.9	So I weep, as Jazer weeps,
ISA.16.9	for the vines of Sibmah.
ISA.16.9	Heshbon and Elealeh,
ISA.16.9	I drench you with tears!
ISA.16.9	The shouts of joy over your ripened fruit
ISA.16.9	and over your harvests have been stilled.
ISA.16.10	Joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards;
ISA.16.10	no one sings or shouts in the vineyards;
ISA.16.10	no one treads out wine at the presses,
ISA.16.10	for I have put an end to the shouting.
ISA.16.11	My heart laments for Moab like a harp,
ISA.16.11	my inmost being for Kir Hareseth.
ISA.16.12	When Moab appears at her high place,
ISA.16.12	she only wears herself out;
ISA.16.12	when she goes to her shrine to pray,
ISA.16.12	it is to no avail.
ISA.16.13	This is the word the 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	A prophecy against Damascus:
ISA.17.1	“See, Damascus will no longer be a city
ISA.17.1	but will become a heap of ruins.
ISA.17.2	The cities of Aroer will be deserted
ISA.17.2	and left to flocks, which will lie down,
ISA.17.2	with no one to make them afraid.
ISA.17.3	The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim,
ISA.17.3	and royal power from Damascus;
ISA.17.3	the remnant of Aram will be
ISA.17.3	like the glory of the Israelites,”
ISA.17.3	declares the 
ISA.17.4	“In that day the glory of Jacob will fade;
ISA.17.4	the fat of his body will waste away.
ISA.17.5	It will be as when reapers harvest the standing grain,
ISA.17.5	gathering the grain in their arms—
ISA.17.5	as when someone gleans heads of grain
ISA.17.5	in the Valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.6	Yet some gleanings will remain,
ISA.17.6	as when an olive tree is beaten,
ISA.17.6	leaving two or three olives on the topmost branches,
ISA.17.6	four or five on the fruitful boughs,”
ISA.17.6	declares the 
ISA.17.7	In that day people will look to their Maker
ISA.17.7	and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.17.8	They will not look to the altars,
ISA.17.8	the work of their hands,
ISA.17.8	and they will have no regard for the Asherah poles
ISA.17.8	and the incense altars their fingers have made.
ISA.17.9	In that day their strong cities, which they left because of the Israelites, will be like places abandoned to thickets and undergrowth. And all will be desolation.
ISA.17.10	You have forgotten God your Savior;
ISA.17.10	you have not remembered the Rock, your fortress.
ISA.17.10	Therefore, though you set out the finest plants
ISA.17.10	and plant imported vines,
ISA.17.11	though on the day you set them out, you make them grow,
ISA.17.11	and on the morning when you plant them, you bring them to bud,
ISA.17.11	yet the harvest will be as nothing
ISA.17.11	in the day of disease and incurable pain.
ISA.17.12	Woe to the many nations that rage—
ISA.17.12	they rage like the raging sea!
ISA.17.12	Woe to the peoples who roar—
ISA.17.12	they roar like the roaring of great waters!
ISA.17.13	Although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters,
ISA.17.13	when he rebukes them they flee far away,
ISA.17.13	driven before the wind like chaff on the hills,
ISA.17.13	like tumbleweed before a gale.
ISA.17.14	In the evening, sudden terror!
ISA.17.14	Before the morning, they are gone!
ISA.17.14	This is the portion of those who loot us,
ISA.17.14	the lot of those who plunder us.
ISA.18.1	Woe to the land of whirring wings
ISA.18.1	along the rivers of Cush,
ISA.18.2	which sends envoys by sea
ISA.18.2	in papyrus boats over the water.
ISA.18.2	Go, swift messengers,
ISA.18.2	to a people tall and smooth-skinned,
ISA.18.2	to a people feared far and wide,
ISA.18.2	an aggressive nation of strange speech,
ISA.18.2	whose land is divided by rivers.
ISA.18.3	All you people of the world,
ISA.18.3	you who live on the earth,
ISA.18.3	when a banner is raised on the mountains,
ISA.18.3	you will see it,
ISA.18.3	and when a trumpet sounds,
ISA.18.3	you will hear it.
ISA.18.4	This is what the 
ISA.18.4	“I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place,
ISA.18.4	like shimmering heat in the sunshine,
ISA.18.4	like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
ISA.18.5	For, before the harvest, when the blossom is gone
ISA.18.5	and the flower becomes a ripening grape,
ISA.18.5	he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives,
ISA.18.5	and cut down and take away the spreading branches.
ISA.18.6	They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey
ISA.18.6	and to the wild animals;
ISA.18.6	the birds will feed on them all summer,
ISA.18.6	the wild animals all winter.
ISA.18.7	At that time gifts will be brought to the 
ISA.18.7	from a people tall and smooth-skinned,
ISA.18.7	from a people feared far and wide,
ISA.18.7	an aggressive nation of strange speech,
ISA.18.7	whose land is divided by rivers—
ISA.18.7	the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the 
ISA.19.1	A prophecy against Egypt:
ISA.19.1	See, the 
ISA.19.1	and is coming to Egypt.
ISA.19.1	The idols of Egypt tremble before him,
ISA.19.1	and the hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear.
ISA.19.2	“I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian—
ISA.19.2	brother will fight against brother,
ISA.19.2	neighbor against neighbor,
ISA.19.2	city against city,
ISA.19.2	kingdom against kingdom.
ISA.19.3	The Egyptians will lose heart,
ISA.19.3	and I will bring their plans to nothing;
ISA.19.3	they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead,
ISA.19.3	the mediums and the spiritists.
ISA.19.4	I will hand the Egyptians over
ISA.19.4	to the power of a cruel master,
ISA.19.4	and a fierce king will rule over them,”
ISA.19.4	declares the Lord, the 
ISA.19.5	The waters of the river will dry up,
ISA.19.5	and the riverbed will be parched and dry.
ISA.19.6	The canals will stink;
ISA.19.6	the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up.
ISA.19.6	The reeds and rushes will wither,
ISA.19.7	also the plants along the Nile,
ISA.19.7	at the mouth of the river.
ISA.19.7	Every sown field along the Nile
ISA.19.7	will become parched, will blow away and be no more.
ISA.19.8	The fishermen will groan and lament,
ISA.19.8	all who cast hooks into the Nile;
ISA.19.8	those who throw nets on the water
ISA.19.8	will pine away.
ISA.19.9	Those who work with combed flax will despair,
ISA.19.9	the weavers of fine linen will lose hope.
ISA.19.10	The workers in cloth will be dejected,
ISA.19.10	and all the wage earners will be sick at heart.
ISA.19.11	The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools;
ISA.19.11	the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice.
ISA.19.11	How can you say to Pharaoh,
ISA.19.11	“I am one of the wise men,
ISA.19.11	a disciple of the ancient kings”?
ISA.19.12	Where are your wise men now?
ISA.19.12	Let them show you and make known
ISA.19.12	what the 
ISA.19.12	has planned against Egypt.
ISA.19.13	The officials of Zoan have become fools,
ISA.19.13	the leaders of Memphis are deceived;
ISA.19.13	the cornerstones of her peoples
ISA.19.13	have led Egypt astray.
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.14	a spirit of dizziness;
ISA.19.14	they make Egypt stagger in all that she does,
ISA.19.14	as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit.
ISA.19.15	There is nothing Egypt can do—
ISA.19.15	head or tail, palm branch or reed.
ISA.19.16	In that day the Egyptians will become weaklings. They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the 
ISA.19.17	And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified, because of what the 
ISA.19.18	In that day five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the 
ISA.19.19	In that day there will be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	It will be a sign and witness to the 
ISA.19.21	So the 
ISA.19.22	The 
ISA.19.23	In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 
ISA.19.24	In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing
ISA.19.25	The 
ISA.20.1	In the year that the supreme commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it— 
ISA.20.2	at that time the 
ISA.20.3	Then the 
ISA.20.4	so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles, young and old, with buttocks bared—to Egypt’s shame. 
ISA.20.5	Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be dismayed and put to shame. 
ISA.20.6	In that day the people who live on this coast will say, ‘See what has happened to those we relied on, those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?’ ”
ISA.21.1	A prophecy against the Desert by the Sea:
ISA.21.1	Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland,
ISA.21.1	an invader comes from the desert,
ISA.21.1	from a land of terror.
ISA.21.2	A dire vision has been shown to me:
ISA.21.2	The traitor betrays, the looter takes loot.
ISA.21.2	Elam, attack! Media, lay siege!
ISA.21.2	I will bring to an end all the groaning she caused.
ISA.21.3	At this my body is racked with pain,
ISA.21.3	pangs seize me, like those of a woman in labor;
ISA.21.3	I am staggered by what I hear,
ISA.21.3	I am bewildered by what I see.
ISA.21.4	My heart falters,
ISA.21.4	fear makes me tremble;
ISA.21.4	the twilight I longed for
ISA.21.4	has become a horror to me.
ISA.21.5	They set the tables,
ISA.21.5	they spread the rugs,
ISA.21.5	they eat, they drink!
ISA.21.5	Get up, you officers,
ISA.21.5	oil the shields!
ISA.21.6	This is what the Lord says to me:
ISA.21.6	“Go, post a lookout
ISA.21.6	and have him report what he sees.
ISA.21.7	When he sees chariots
ISA.21.7	with teams of horses,
ISA.21.7	riders on donkeys
ISA.21.7	or riders on camels,
ISA.21.7	let him be alert,
ISA.21.7	fully alert.”
ISA.21.8	And the lookout
ISA.21.8	“Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower;
ISA.21.8	every night I stay at my post.
ISA.21.9	Look, here comes a man in a chariot
ISA.21.9	with a team of horses.
ISA.21.9	And he gives back the answer:
ISA.21.9	‘Babylon has fallen, has fallen!
ISA.21.9	All the images of its gods
ISA.21.9	lie shattered on the ground!’ ”
ISA.21.10	My people who are crushed on the threshing floor,
ISA.21.10	I tell you what I have heard
ISA.21.10	from the 
ISA.21.10	from the God of Israel.
ISA.21.11	A prophecy against Dumah
ISA.21.11	Someone calls to me from Seir,
ISA.21.11	“Watchman, what is left of the night?
ISA.21.11	Watchman, what is left of the night?”
ISA.21.12	The watchman replies,
ISA.21.12	“Morning is coming, but also the night.
ISA.21.12	If you would ask, then ask;
ISA.21.12	and come back yet again.”
ISA.21.13	A prophecy against Arabia:
ISA.21.13	You caravans of Dedanites,
ISA.21.13	who camp in the thickets of Arabia,
ISA.21.14	bring water for the thirsty;
ISA.21.14	you who live in Tema,
ISA.21.14	bring food for the fugitives.
ISA.21.15	They flee from the sword,
ISA.21.15	from the drawn sword,
ISA.21.15	from the bent bow
ISA.21.15	and from the heat of battle.
ISA.21.16	This is what the Lord says to me: “Within one year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end. 
ISA.21.17	The survivors of the archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.” The 
ISA.22.1	A prophecy against the Valley of Vision:
ISA.22.1	What troubles you now,
ISA.22.1	that you have all gone up on the roofs,
ISA.22.2	you town so full of commotion,
ISA.22.2	you city of tumult and revelry?
ISA.22.2	Your slain were not killed by the sword,
ISA.22.2	nor did they die in battle.
ISA.22.3	All your leaders have fled together;
ISA.22.3	they have been captured without using the bow.
ISA.22.3	All you who were caught were taken prisoner together,
ISA.22.3	having fled while the enemy was still far away.
ISA.22.4	Therefore I said, “Turn away from me;
ISA.22.4	let me weep bitterly.
ISA.22.4	Do not try to console me
ISA.22.4	over the destruction of my people.”
ISA.22.5	The Lord, the 
ISA.22.5	of tumult and trampling and terror
ISA.22.5	in the Valley of Vision,
ISA.22.5	a day of battering down walls
ISA.22.5	and of crying out to the mountains.
ISA.22.6	Elam takes up the quiver,
ISA.22.6	with her charioteers and horses;
ISA.22.6	Kir uncovers the shield.
ISA.22.7	Your choicest valleys are full of chariots,
ISA.22.7	and horsemen are posted at the city gates.
ISA.22.8	The Lord stripped away the defenses of Judah,
ISA.22.8	and you looked in that day
ISA.22.8	to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest.
ISA.22.9	You saw that the walls of the City of David
ISA.22.9	were broken through in many places;
ISA.22.9	you stored up water
ISA.22.9	in the Lower Pool.
ISA.22.10	You counted the buildings in Jerusalem
ISA.22.10	and tore down houses to strengthen the wall.
ISA.22.11	You built a reservoir between the two walls
ISA.22.11	for the water of the Old Pool,
ISA.22.11	but you did not look to the One who made it,
ISA.22.11	or have regard for the One who planned it long ago.
ISA.22.12	The Lord, the 
ISA.22.12	called you on that day
ISA.22.12	to weep and to wail,
ISA.22.12	to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth.
ISA.22.13	But see, there is joy and revelry,
ISA.22.13	slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep,
ISA.22.13	eating of meat and drinking of wine!
ISA.22.13	“Let us eat and drink,” you say,
ISA.22.13	“for tomorrow we die!”
ISA.22.14	The 
ISA.22.15	This is what the Lord, the 
ISA.22.15	“Go, say to this steward,
ISA.22.15	to Shebna the palace administrator:
ISA.22.16	What are you doing here and who gave you permission
ISA.22.16	to cut out a grave for yourself here,
ISA.22.16	hewing your grave on the height
ISA.22.16	and chiseling your resting place in the rock?
ISA.22.17	“Beware, the 
ISA.22.17	and hurl you away, you mighty man.
ISA.22.18	He will roll you up tightly like a ball
ISA.22.18	and throw you into a large country.
ISA.22.18	There you will die
ISA.22.18	and there the chariots you were so proud of
ISA.22.18	will become a disgrace to your master’s house.
ISA.22.19	I will depose you from your office,
ISA.22.19	and you will be ousted from your position.
ISA.22.20	“In that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah. 
ISA.22.21	I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah. 
ISA.22.22	I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. 
ISA.22.23	I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will become a seat
ISA.22.24	All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots—all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.
ISA.22.25	“In that day,” declares the 
ISA.23.1	A prophecy against Tyre:
ISA.23.1	Wail, you ships of Tarshish!
ISA.23.1	For Tyre is destroyed
ISA.23.1	and left without house or harbor.
ISA.23.1	From the land of Cyprus
ISA.23.1	word has come to them.
ISA.23.2	Be silent, you people of the island
ISA.23.2	and you merchants of Sidon,
ISA.23.2	whom the seafarers have enriched.
ISA.23.3	On the great waters
ISA.23.3	came the grain of the Shihor;
ISA.23.3	the harvest of the Nile
ISA.23.3	and she became the marketplace of the nations.
ISA.23.4	Be ashamed, Sidon, and you fortress of the sea,
ISA.23.4	for the sea has spoken:
ISA.23.4	“I have neither been in labor nor given birth;
ISA.23.4	I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters.”
ISA.23.5	When word comes to Egypt,
ISA.23.5	they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre.
ISA.23.6	Cross over to Tarshish;
ISA.23.6	wail, you people of the island.
ISA.23.7	Is this your city of revelry,
ISA.23.7	the old, old city,
ISA.23.7	whose feet have taken her
ISA.23.7	to settle in far-off lands?
ISA.23.8	Who planned this against Tyre,
ISA.23.8	the bestower of crowns,
ISA.23.8	whose merchants are princes,
ISA.23.8	whose traders are renowned in the earth?
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.9	to bring down her pride in all her splendor
ISA.23.9	and to humble all who are renowned on the earth.
ISA.23.10	Till
ISA.23.10	Daughter Tarshish,
ISA.23.10	for you no longer have a harbor.
ISA.23.11	The 
ISA.23.11	and made its kingdoms tremble.
ISA.23.11	He has given an order concerning Phoenicia
ISA.23.11	that her fortresses be destroyed.
ISA.23.12	He said, “No more of your reveling,
ISA.23.12	Virgin Daughter Sidon, now crushed!
ISA.23.12	“Up, cross over to Cyprus;
ISA.23.12	even there you will find no rest.”
ISA.23.13	Look at the land of the Babylonians,
ISA.23.13	this people that is now of no account!
ISA.23.13	The Assyrians have made it
ISA.23.13	a place for desert creatures;
ISA.23.13	they raised up their siege towers,
ISA.23.13	they stripped its fortresses bare
ISA.23.13	and turned it into a ruin.
ISA.23.14	Wail, you ships of Tarshish;
ISA.23.14	your fortress is destroyed!
ISA.23.15	At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king’s life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:
ISA.23.16	“Take up a harp, walk through the city,
ISA.23.16	you forgotten prostitute;
ISA.23.16	play the harp well, sing many a song,
ISA.23.16	so that you will be remembered.”
ISA.23.17	At the end of seventy years, the 
ISA.23.18	Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the 
ISA.24.1	See, the 
ISA.24.1	and devastate it;
ISA.24.1	he will ruin its face
ISA.24.1	and scatter its inhabitants—
ISA.24.2	it will be the same
ISA.24.2	for priest as for people,
ISA.24.2	for the master as for his servant,
ISA.24.2	for the mistress as for her servant,
ISA.24.2	for seller as for buyer,
ISA.24.2	for borrower as for lender,
ISA.24.2	for debtor as for creditor.
ISA.24.3	The earth will be completely laid waste
ISA.24.3	and totally plundered.
ISA.24.3	The 
ISA.24.4	The earth dries up and withers,
ISA.24.4	the world languishes and withers,
ISA.24.4	the heavens languish with the earth.
ISA.24.5	The earth is defiled by its people;
ISA.24.5	they have disobeyed the laws,
ISA.24.5	violated the statutes
ISA.24.5	and broken the everlasting covenant.
ISA.24.6	Therefore a curse consumes the earth;
ISA.24.6	its people must bear their guilt.
ISA.24.6	Therefore earth’s inhabitants are burned up,
ISA.24.6	and very few are left.
ISA.24.7	The new wine dries up and the vine withers;
ISA.24.7	all the merrymakers groan.
ISA.24.8	The joyful timbrels are stilled,
ISA.24.8	the noise of the revelers has stopped,
ISA.24.8	the joyful harp is silent.
ISA.24.9	No longer do they drink wine with a song;
ISA.24.9	the beer is bitter to its drinkers.
ISA.24.10	The ruined city lies desolate;
ISA.24.10	the entrance to every house is barred.
ISA.24.11	In the streets they cry out for wine;
ISA.24.11	all joy turns to gloom,
ISA.24.11	all joyful sounds are banished from the earth.
ISA.24.12	The city is left in ruins,
ISA.24.12	its gate is battered to pieces.
ISA.24.13	So will it be on the earth
ISA.24.13	and among the nations,
ISA.24.13	as when an olive tree is beaten,
ISA.24.13	or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest.
ISA.24.14	They raise their voices, they shout for joy;
ISA.24.14	from the west they acclaim the 
ISA.24.15	Therefore in the east give glory to the 
ISA.24.15	exalt the name of the 
ISA.24.15	in the islands of the sea.
ISA.24.16	From the ends of the earth we hear singing:
ISA.24.16	“Glory to the Righteous One.”
ISA.24.16	But I said, “I waste away, I waste away!
ISA.24.16	Woe to me!
ISA.24.16	The treacherous betray!
ISA.24.16	With treachery the treacherous betray!”
ISA.24.17	Terror and pit and snare await you,
ISA.24.17	people of the earth.
ISA.24.18	Whoever flees at the sound of terror
ISA.24.18	will fall into a pit;
ISA.24.18	whoever climbs out of the pit
ISA.24.18	will be caught in a snare.
ISA.24.18	The floodgates of the heavens are opened,
ISA.24.18	the foundations of the earth shake.
ISA.24.19	The earth is broken up,
ISA.24.19	the earth is split asunder,
ISA.24.19	the earth is violently shaken.
ISA.24.20	The earth reels like a drunkard,
ISA.24.20	it sways like a hut in the wind;
ISA.24.20	so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion
ISA.24.20	that it falls—never to rise again.
ISA.24.21	In that day the 
ISA.24.21	the powers in the heavens above
ISA.24.21	and the kings on the earth below.
ISA.24.22	They will be herded together
ISA.24.22	like prisoners bound in a dungeon;
ISA.24.22	they will be shut up in prison
ISA.24.22	and be punished
ISA.24.23	The moon will be dismayed,
ISA.24.23	the sun ashamed;
ISA.24.23	for the 
ISA.24.23	on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
ISA.24.23	and before its elders—with great glory.
ISA.25.1	I will exalt you and praise your name,
ISA.25.1	for in perfect faithfulness
ISA.25.1	you have done wonderful things,
ISA.25.1	things planned long ago.
ISA.25.2	You have made the city a heap of rubble,
ISA.25.2	the fortified town a ruin,
ISA.25.2	the foreigners’ stronghold a city no more;
ISA.25.2	it will never be rebuilt.
ISA.25.3	Therefore strong peoples will honor you;
ISA.25.3	cities of ruthless nations will revere you.
ISA.25.4	You have been a refuge for the poor,
ISA.25.4	a refuge for the needy in their distress,
ISA.25.4	a shelter from the storm
ISA.25.4	and a shade from the heat.
ISA.25.4	For the breath of the ruthless
ISA.25.4	is like a storm driving against a wall
ISA.25.5	and like the heat of the desert.
ISA.25.5	You silence the uproar of foreigners;
ISA.25.5	as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud,
ISA.25.5	so the song of the ruthless is stilled.
ISA.25.6	On this mountain the 
ISA.25.6	a feast of rich food for all peoples,
ISA.25.6	a banquet of aged wine—
ISA.25.6	the best of meats and the finest of wines.
ISA.25.7	On this mountain he will destroy
ISA.25.7	the shroud that enfolds all peoples,
ISA.25.7	the sheet that covers all nations;
ISA.25.8	he will swallow up death forever.
ISA.25.8	The Sovereign 
ISA.25.8	from all faces;
ISA.25.8	he will remove his people’s disgrace
ISA.25.8	from all the earth.
ISA.25.8	The 
ISA.25.9	In that day they will say,
ISA.25.9	“Surely this is our God;
ISA.25.9	we trusted in him, and he saved us.
ISA.25.9	This is the 
ISA.25.9	let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.”
ISA.25.10	The hand of the 
ISA.25.10	but Moab will be trampled in their land
ISA.25.10	as straw is trampled down in the manure.
ISA.25.11	They will stretch out their hands in it,
ISA.25.11	as swimmers stretch out their hands to swim.
ISA.25.11	God will bring down their pride
ISA.25.11	despite the cleverness
ISA.25.12	He will bring down your high fortified walls
ISA.25.12	and lay them low;
ISA.25.12	he will bring them down to the ground,
ISA.25.12	to the very dust.
ISA.26.1	In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
ISA.26.1	We have a strong city;
ISA.26.1	God makes salvation
ISA.26.1	its walls and ramparts.
ISA.26.2	Open the gates
ISA.26.2	that the righteous nation may enter,
ISA.26.2	the nation that keeps faith.
ISA.26.3	You will keep in perfect peace
ISA.26.3	those whose minds are steadfast,
ISA.26.3	because they trust in you.
ISA.26.4	Trust in the 
ISA.26.4	for the 
ISA.26.5	He humbles those who dwell on high,
ISA.26.5	he lays the lofty city low;
ISA.26.5	he levels it to the ground
ISA.26.5	and casts it down to the dust.
ISA.26.6	Feet trample it down—
ISA.26.6	the feet of the oppressed,
ISA.26.6	the footsteps of the poor.
ISA.26.7	The path of the righteous is level;
ISA.26.7	you, the Upright One, make the way of the righteous smooth.
ISA.26.8	Yes, 
ISA.26.8	we wait for you;
ISA.26.8	your name and renown
ISA.26.8	are the desire of our hearts.
ISA.26.9	My soul yearns for you in the night;
ISA.26.9	in the morning my spirit longs for you.
ISA.26.9	When your judgments come upon the earth,
ISA.26.9	the people of the world learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	But when grace is shown to the wicked,
ISA.26.10	they do not learn righteousness;
ISA.26.10	even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil
ISA.26.10	and do not regard the majesty of the 
ISA.26.11	but they do not see it.
ISA.26.11	Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame;
ISA.26.11	let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.
ISA.26.12	all that we have accomplished you have done for us.
ISA.26.13	but your name alone do we honor.
ISA.26.14	They are now dead, they live no more;
ISA.26.14	their spirits do not rise.
ISA.26.14	You punished them and brought them to ruin;
ISA.26.14	you wiped out all memory of them.
ISA.26.15	You have enlarged the nation, 
ISA.26.15	you have enlarged the nation.
ISA.26.15	You have gained glory for yourself;
ISA.26.15	you have extended all the borders of the land.
ISA.26.16	when you disciplined them,
ISA.26.16	they could barely whisper a prayer.
ISA.26.17	As a pregnant woman about to give birth
ISA.26.17	writhes and cries out in her pain,
ISA.26.17	so were we in your presence, 
ISA.26.18	We were with child, we writhed in labor,
ISA.26.18	but we gave birth to wind.
ISA.26.18	We have not brought salvation to the earth,
ISA.26.18	and the people of the world have not come to life.
ISA.26.19	But your dead will live, 
ISA.26.19	their bodies will rise—
ISA.26.19	let those who dwell in the dust
ISA.26.19	wake up and shout for joy—
ISA.26.19	your dew is like the dew of the morning;
ISA.26.19	the earth will give birth to her dead.
ISA.26.20	Go, my people, enter your rooms
ISA.26.20	and shut the doors behind you;
ISA.26.20	hide yourselves for a little while
ISA.26.20	until his wrath has passed by.
ISA.26.21	See, the 
ISA.26.21	to punish the people of the earth for their sins.
ISA.26.21	The earth will disclose the blood shed on it;
ISA.26.21	the earth will conceal its slain no longer.
ISA.27.1	In that day,
ISA.27.1	the 
ISA.27.1	his fierce, great and powerful sword—
ISA.27.1	Leviathan the gliding serpent,
ISA.27.1	Leviathan the coiling serpent;
ISA.27.1	he will slay the monster of the sea.
ISA.27.2	In that day—
ISA.27.2	“Sing about a fruitful vineyard:
ISA.27.3	I, the 
ISA.27.3	I water it continually.
ISA.27.3	I guard it day and night
ISA.27.3	so that no one may harm it.
ISA.27.4	I am not angry.
ISA.27.4	If only there were briers and thorns confronting me!
ISA.27.4	I would march against them in battle;
ISA.27.4	I would set them all on fire.
ISA.27.5	Or else let them come to me for refuge;
ISA.27.5	let them make peace with me,
ISA.27.5	yes, let them make peace with me.”
ISA.27.6	In days to come Jacob will take root,
ISA.27.6	Israel will bud and blossom
ISA.27.6	and fill all the world with fruit.
ISA.27.7	Has the 
ISA.27.7	as he struck down those who struck her?
ISA.27.7	Has she been killed
ISA.27.7	as those were killed who killed her?
ISA.27.8	By warfare
ISA.27.8	with his fierce blast he drives her out,
ISA.27.8	as on a day the east wind blows.
ISA.27.9	By this, then, will Jacob’s guilt be atoned for,
ISA.27.9	and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin:
ISA.27.9	When he makes all the altar stones
ISA.27.9	to be like limestone crushed to pieces,
ISA.27.9	no Asherah poles
ISA.27.9	will be left standing.
ISA.27.10	The fortified city stands desolate,
ISA.27.10	an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the wilderness;
ISA.27.10	there the calves graze,
ISA.27.10	there they lie down;
ISA.27.10	they strip its branches bare.
ISA.27.11	When its twigs are dry, they are broken off
ISA.27.11	and women come and make fires with them.
ISA.27.11	For this is a people without understanding;
ISA.27.11	so their Maker has no compassion on them,
ISA.27.11	and their Creator shows them no favor.
ISA.27.12	In that day the 
ISA.27.13	And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the 
ISA.28.1	Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim’s drunkards,
ISA.28.1	to the fading flower, his glorious beauty,
ISA.28.1	set on the head of a fertile valley—
ISA.28.1	to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine!
ISA.28.2	See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong.
ISA.28.2	Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind,
ISA.28.2	like a driving rain and a flooding downpour,
ISA.28.2	he will throw it forcefully to the ground.
ISA.28.3	That wreath, the pride of Ephraim’s drunkards,
ISA.28.3	will be trampled underfoot.
ISA.28.4	That fading flower, his glorious beauty,
ISA.28.4	set on the head of a fertile valley,
ISA.28.4	will be like figs ripe before harvest—
ISA.28.4	as soon as people see them and take them in hand,
ISA.28.4	they swallow them.
ISA.28.5	In that day the 
ISA.28.5	will be a glorious crown,
ISA.28.5	a beautiful wreath
ISA.28.5	for the remnant of his people.
ISA.28.6	He will be a spirit of justice
ISA.28.6	to the one who sits in judgment,
ISA.28.6	a source of strength
ISA.28.6	to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
ISA.28.7	And these also stagger from wine
ISA.28.7	and reel from beer:
ISA.28.7	Priests and prophets stagger from beer
ISA.28.7	and are befuddled with wine;
ISA.28.7	they reel from beer,
ISA.28.7	they stagger when seeing visions,
ISA.28.7	they stumble when rendering decisions.
ISA.28.8	All the tables are covered with vomit
ISA.28.8	and there is not a spot without filth.
ISA.28.9	“Who is it he is trying to teach?
ISA.28.9	To whom is he explaining his message?
ISA.28.9	To children weaned from their milk,
ISA.28.9	to those just taken from the breast?
ISA.28.10	For it is:
ISA.28.10	Do this, do that,
ISA.28.10	a rule for this, a rule for that
ISA.28.10	a little here, a little there.”
ISA.28.11	Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues
ISA.28.11	God will speak to this people,
ISA.28.12	to whom he said,
ISA.28.12	“This is the resting place, let the weary rest”;
ISA.28.12	and, “This is the place of repose”—
ISA.28.12	but they would not listen.
ISA.28.13	So then, the word of the 
ISA.28.13	Do this, do that,
ISA.28.13	a rule for this, a rule for that;
ISA.28.13	a little here, a little there—
ISA.28.13	so that as they go they will fall backward;
ISA.28.13	they will be injured and snared and captured.
ISA.28.14	Therefore hear the word of the 
ISA.28.14	who rule this people in Jerusalem.
ISA.28.15	You boast, “We have entered into a covenant with death,
ISA.28.15	with the realm of the dead we have made an agreement.
ISA.28.15	When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by,
ISA.28.15	it cannot touch us,
ISA.28.15	for we have made a lie our refuge
ISA.28.15	and falsehood
ISA.28.16	So this is what the Sovereign 
ISA.28.16	“See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone,
ISA.28.16	a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation;
ISA.28.16	the one who relies on it
ISA.28.16	will never be stricken with panic.
ISA.28.17	I will make justice the measuring line
ISA.28.17	and righteousness the plumb line;
ISA.28.17	hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie,
ISA.28.17	and water will overflow your hiding place.
ISA.28.18	Your covenant with death will be annulled;
ISA.28.18	your agreement with the realm of the dead will not stand.
ISA.28.18	When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by,
ISA.28.18	you will be beaten down by it.
ISA.28.19	As often as it comes it will carry you away;
ISA.28.19	morning after morning, by day and by night,
ISA.28.19	it will sweep through.”
ISA.28.19	The understanding of this message
ISA.28.19	will bring sheer terror.
ISA.28.20	The bed is too short to stretch out on,
ISA.28.20	the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.
ISA.28.21	The 
ISA.28.21	he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon—
ISA.28.21	to do his work, his strange work,
ISA.28.21	and perform his task, his alien task.
ISA.28.22	Now stop your mocking,
ISA.28.22	or your chains will become heavier;
ISA.28.22	the Lord, the 
ISA.28.22	of the destruction decreed against the whole land.
ISA.28.23	Listen and hear my voice;
ISA.28.23	pay attention and hear what I say.
ISA.28.24	When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually?
ISA.28.24	Does he keep on breaking up and working the soil?
ISA.28.25	When he has leveled the surface,
ISA.28.25	does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin?
ISA.28.25	Does he not plant wheat in its place,
ISA.28.25	barley in its plot,
ISA.28.25	and spelt in its field?
ISA.28.26	His God instructs him
ISA.28.26	and teaches him the right way.
ISA.28.27	Caraway is not threshed with a sledge,
ISA.28.27	nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin;
ISA.28.27	caraway is beaten out with a rod,
ISA.28.27	and cumin with a stick.
ISA.28.28	Grain must be ground to make bread;
ISA.28.28	so one does not go on threshing it forever.
ISA.28.28	The wheels of a threshing cart may be rolled over it,
ISA.28.28	but one does not use horses to grind grain.
ISA.28.29	All this also comes from the 
ISA.28.29	whose plan is wonderful,
ISA.28.29	whose wisdom is magnificent.
ISA.29.1	Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel,
ISA.29.1	the city where David settled!
ISA.29.1	Add year to year
ISA.29.1	and let your cycle of festivals go on.
ISA.29.2	Yet I will besiege Ariel;
ISA.29.2	she will mourn and lament,
ISA.29.2	she will be to me like an altar hearth.
ISA.29.3	I will encamp against you on all sides;
ISA.29.3	I will encircle you with towers
ISA.29.3	and set up my siege works against you.
ISA.29.4	Brought low, you will speak from the ground;
ISA.29.4	your speech will mumble out of the dust.
ISA.29.4	Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth;
ISA.29.4	out of the dust your speech will whisper.
ISA.29.5	But your many enemies will become like fine dust,
ISA.29.5	the ruthless hordes like blown chaff.
ISA.29.5	Suddenly, in an instant,
ISA.29.6	the 
ISA.29.6	with thunder and earthquake and great noise,
ISA.29.6	with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire.
ISA.29.7	Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
ISA.29.7	that attack her and her fortress and besiege her,
ISA.29.7	will be as it is with a dream,
ISA.29.7	with a vision in the night—
ISA.29.8	as when a hungry person dreams of eating,
ISA.29.8	but awakens hungry still;
ISA.29.8	as when a thirsty person dreams of drinking,
ISA.29.8	but awakens faint and thirsty still.
ISA.29.8	So will it be with the hordes of all the nations
ISA.29.8	that fight against Mount Zion.
ISA.29.9	Be stunned and amazed,
ISA.29.9	blind yourselves and be sightless;
ISA.29.9	be drunk, but not from wine,
ISA.29.9	stagger, but not from beer.
ISA.29.10	The 
ISA.29.10	He has sealed your eyes (the prophets);
ISA.29.10	he has covered your heads (the seers).
ISA.29.11	For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say, “Read this, please,” they will answer, “I can’t; it is sealed.” 
ISA.29.12	Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, “Read this, please,” they will answer, “I don’t know how to read.”
ISA.29.13	The Lord says:
ISA.29.13	“These people come near to me with their mouth
ISA.29.13	and honor me with their lips,
ISA.29.13	but their hearts are far from me.
ISA.29.13	Their worship of me
ISA.29.13	is based on merely human rules they have been taught.
ISA.29.14	Therefore once more I will astound these people
ISA.29.14	with wonder upon wonder;
ISA.29.14	the wisdom of the wise will perish,
ISA.29.14	the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish.”
ISA.29.15	Woe to those who go to great depths
ISA.29.15	to hide their plans from the 
ISA.29.15	who do their work in darkness and think,
ISA.29.15	“Who sees us? Who will know?”
ISA.29.16	You turn things upside down,
ISA.29.16	as if the potter were thought to be like the clay!
ISA.29.16	Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it,
ISA.29.16	“You did not make me”?
ISA.29.16	Can the pot say to the potter,
ISA.29.16	“You know nothing”?
ISA.29.17	In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field
ISA.29.17	and the fertile field seem like a forest?
ISA.29.18	In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll,
ISA.29.18	and out of gloom and darkness
ISA.29.18	the eyes of the blind will see.
ISA.29.19	Once more the humble will rejoice in the 
ISA.29.19	the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.29.20	The ruthless will vanish,
ISA.29.20	the mockers will disappear,
ISA.29.20	and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down—
ISA.29.21	those who with a word make someone out to be guilty,
ISA.29.21	who ensnare the defender in court
ISA.29.21	and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice.
ISA.29.22	Therefore this is what the 
ISA.29.22	“No longer will Jacob be ashamed;
ISA.29.22	no longer will their faces grow pale.
ISA.29.23	When they see among them their children,
ISA.29.23	the work of my hands,
ISA.29.23	they will keep my name holy;
ISA.29.23	they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob,
ISA.29.23	and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
ISA.29.24	Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding;
ISA.29.24	those who complain will accept instruction.”
ISA.30.1	“Woe to the obstinate children,”
ISA.30.1	declares the 
ISA.30.1	“to those who carry out plans that are not mine,
ISA.30.1	forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit,
ISA.30.1	heaping sin upon sin;
ISA.30.2	who go down to Egypt
ISA.30.2	without consulting me;
ISA.30.2	who look for help to Pharaoh’s protection,
ISA.30.2	to Egypt’s shade for refuge.
ISA.30.3	But Pharaoh’s protection will be to your shame,
ISA.30.3	Egypt’s shade will bring you disgrace.
ISA.30.4	Though they have officials in Zoan
ISA.30.4	and their envoys have arrived in Hanes,
ISA.30.5	everyone will be put to shame
ISA.30.5	because of a people useless to them,
ISA.30.5	who bring neither help nor advantage,
ISA.30.5	but only shame and disgrace.”
ISA.30.6	A prophecy concerning the animals of the Negev:
ISA.30.6	Through a land of hardship and distress,
ISA.30.6	of lions and lionesses,
ISA.30.6	of adders and darting snakes,
ISA.30.6	the envoys carry their riches on donkeys’ backs,
ISA.30.6	their treasures on the humps of camels,
ISA.30.6	to that unprofitable nation,
ISA.30.7	to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless.
ISA.30.7	Therefore I call her
ISA.30.7	Rahab the Do-Nothing.
ISA.30.8	Go now, write it on a tablet for them,
ISA.30.8	inscribe it on a scroll,
ISA.30.8	that for the days to come
ISA.30.8	it may be an everlasting witness.
ISA.30.9	For these are rebellious people, deceitful children,
ISA.30.9	children unwilling to listen to the 
ISA.30.10	They say to the seers,
ISA.30.10	“See no more visions!”
ISA.30.10	and to the prophets,
ISA.30.10	“Give us no more visions of what is right!
ISA.30.10	Tell us pleasant things,
ISA.30.10	prophesy illusions.
ISA.30.11	Leave this way,
ISA.30.11	get off this path,
ISA.30.11	and stop confronting us
ISA.30.11	with the Holy One of Israel!”
ISA.30.12	Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says:
ISA.30.12	“Because you have rejected this message,
ISA.30.12	relied on oppression
ISA.30.12	and depended on deceit,
ISA.30.13	this sin will become for you
ISA.30.13	like a high wall, cracked and bulging,
ISA.30.13	that collapses suddenly, in an instant.
ISA.30.14	It will break in pieces like pottery,
ISA.30.14	shattered so mercilessly
ISA.30.14	that among its pieces not a fragment will be found
ISA.30.14	for taking coals from a hearth
ISA.30.14	or scooping water out of a cistern.”
ISA.30.15	This is what the Sovereign 
ISA.30.15	“In repentance and rest is your salvation,
ISA.30.15	in quietness and trust is your strength,
ISA.30.15	but you would have none of it.
ISA.30.16	You said, ‘No, we will flee on horses.’
ISA.30.16	Therefore you will flee!
ISA.30.16	You said, ‘We will ride off on swift horses.’
ISA.30.16	Therefore your pursuers will be swift!
ISA.30.17	A thousand will flee
ISA.30.17	at the threat of one;
ISA.30.17	at the threat of five
ISA.30.17	you will all flee away,
ISA.30.17	till you are left
ISA.30.17	like a flagstaff on a mountaintop,
ISA.30.17	like a banner on a hill.”
ISA.30.18	Yet the 
ISA.30.18	therefore he will rise up to show you compassion.
ISA.30.18	For the 
ISA.30.18	Blessed are all who wait for him!
ISA.30.19	People of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you. 
ISA.30.20	Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them. 
ISA.30.21	Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.” 
ISA.30.22	Then you will desecrate your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, “Away with you!”
ISA.30.23	He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows. 
ISA.30.24	The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel. 
ISA.30.25	In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill. 
ISA.30.26	The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the 
ISA.30.27	See, the Name of the 
ISA.30.27	with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke;
ISA.30.27	his lips are full of wrath,
ISA.30.27	and his tongue is a consuming fire.
ISA.30.28	His breath is like a rushing torrent,
ISA.30.28	rising up to the neck.
ISA.30.28	He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction;
ISA.30.28	he places in the jaws of the peoples
ISA.30.28	a bit that leads them astray.
ISA.30.29	And you will sing
ISA.30.29	as on the night you celebrate a holy festival;
ISA.30.29	your hearts will rejoice
ISA.30.29	as when people playing pipes go up
ISA.30.29	to the mountain of the 
ISA.30.29	to the Rock of Israel.
ISA.30.30	The 
ISA.30.30	and will make them see his arm coming down
ISA.30.30	with raging anger and consuming fire,
ISA.30.30	with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail.
ISA.30.31	The voice of the 
ISA.30.31	with his rod he will strike them down.
ISA.30.32	Every stroke the 
ISA.30.32	with his punishing club
ISA.30.32	will be to the music of timbrels and harps,
ISA.30.32	as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm.
ISA.30.33	Topheth has long been prepared;
ISA.30.33	it has been made ready for the king.
ISA.30.33	Its fire pit has been made deep and wide,
ISA.30.33	with an abundance of fire and wood;
ISA.30.33	the breath of the 
ISA.30.33	like a stream of burning sulfur,
ISA.30.33	sets it ablaze.
ISA.31.1	Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,
ISA.31.1	who rely on horses,
ISA.31.1	who trust in the multitude of their chariots
ISA.31.1	and in the great strength of their horsemen,
ISA.31.1	but do not look to the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.31.1	or seek help from the 
ISA.31.2	Yet he too is wise and can bring disaster;
ISA.31.2	he does not take back his words.
ISA.31.2	He will rise up against that wicked nation,
ISA.31.2	against those who help evildoers.
ISA.31.3	But the Egyptians are mere mortals and not God;
ISA.31.3	their horses are flesh and not spirit.
ISA.31.3	When the 
ISA.31.3	those who help will stumble,
ISA.31.3	those who are helped will fall;
ISA.31.3	all will perish together.
ISA.31.4	This is what the 
ISA.31.4	“As a lion growls,
ISA.31.4	a great lion over its prey—
ISA.31.4	and though a whole band of shepherds
ISA.31.4	is called together against it,
ISA.31.4	it is not frightened by their shouts
ISA.31.4	or disturbed by their clamor—
ISA.31.4	so the 
ISA.31.4	to do battle on Mount Zion and on its heights.
ISA.31.5	Like birds hovering overhead,
ISA.31.5	the 
ISA.31.5	he will shield it and deliver it,
ISA.31.5	he will ‘pass over’ it and will rescue it.”
ISA.31.6	Return, you Israelites, to the One you have so greatly revolted against. 
ISA.31.7	For in that day every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold your sinful hands have made.
ISA.31.8	“Assyria will fall by no human sword;
ISA.31.8	a sword, not of mortals, will devour them.
ISA.31.8	They will flee before the sword
ISA.31.8	and their young men will be put to forced labor.
ISA.31.9	Their stronghold will fall because of terror;
ISA.31.9	at the sight of the battle standard their commanders will panic,”
ISA.31.9	declares the 
ISA.31.9	whose fire is in Zion,
ISA.31.9	whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
ISA.32.1	See, a king will reign in righteousness
ISA.32.1	and rulers will rule with justice.
ISA.32.2	Each one will be like a shelter from the wind
ISA.32.2	and a refuge from the storm,
ISA.32.2	like streams of water in the desert
ISA.32.2	and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.
ISA.32.3	Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed,
ISA.32.3	and the ears of those who hear will listen.
ISA.32.4	The fearful heart will know and understand,
ISA.32.4	and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.
ISA.32.5	No longer will the fool be called noble
ISA.32.5	nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
ISA.32.6	For fools speak folly,
ISA.32.6	their hearts are bent on evil:
ISA.32.6	They practice ungodliness
ISA.32.6	and spread error concerning the 
ISA.32.6	the hungry they leave empty
ISA.32.6	and from the thirsty they withhold water.
ISA.32.7	Scoundrels use wicked methods,
ISA.32.7	they make up evil schemes
ISA.32.7	to destroy the poor with lies,
ISA.32.7	even when the plea of the needy is just.
ISA.32.8	But the noble make noble plans,
ISA.32.8	and by noble deeds they stand.
ISA.32.9	You women who are so complacent,
ISA.32.9	rise up and listen to me;
ISA.32.9	you daughters who feel secure,
ISA.32.9	hear what I have to say!
ISA.32.10	In little more than a year
ISA.32.10	you who feel secure will tremble;
ISA.32.10	the grape harvest will fail,
ISA.32.10	and the harvest of fruit will not come.
ISA.32.11	Tremble, you complacent women;
ISA.32.11	shudder, you daughters who feel secure!
ISA.32.11	Strip off your fine clothes
ISA.32.11	and wrap yourselves in rags.
ISA.32.12	Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,
ISA.32.12	for the fruitful vines
ISA.32.13	and for the land of my people,
ISA.32.13	a land overgrown with thorns and briers—
ISA.32.13	yes, mourn for all houses of merriment
ISA.32.13	and for this city of revelry.
ISA.32.14	The fortress will be abandoned,
ISA.32.14	the noisy city deserted;
ISA.32.14	citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever,
ISA.32.14	the delight of donkeys, a pasture for flocks,
ISA.32.15	till the Spirit is poured on us from on high,
ISA.32.15	and the desert becomes a fertile field,
ISA.32.15	and the fertile field seems like a forest.
ISA.32.16	The 
ISA.32.16	his righteousness live in the fertile field.
ISA.32.17	The fruit of that righteousness will be peace;
ISA.32.17	its effect will be quietness and confidence forever.
ISA.32.18	My people will live in peaceful dwelling places,
ISA.32.18	in secure homes,
ISA.32.18	in undisturbed places of rest.
ISA.32.19	Though hail flattens the forest
ISA.32.19	and the city is leveled completely,
ISA.32.20	how blessed you will be,
ISA.32.20	sowing your seed by every stream,
ISA.32.20	and letting your cattle and donkeys range free.
ISA.33.1	Woe to you, destroyer,
ISA.33.1	you who have not been destroyed!
ISA.33.1	Woe to you, betrayer,
ISA.33.1	you who have not been betrayed!
ISA.33.1	When you stop destroying,
ISA.33.1	you will be destroyed;
ISA.33.1	when you stop betraying,
ISA.33.1	you will be betrayed.
ISA.33.2	we long for you.
ISA.33.2	Be our strength every morning,
ISA.33.2	our salvation in time of distress.
ISA.33.3	At the uproar of your army, the peoples flee;
ISA.33.3	when you rise up, the nations scatter.
ISA.33.4	Your plunder, O nations, is harvested as by young locusts;
ISA.33.4	like a swarm of locusts people pounce on it.
ISA.33.5	The 
ISA.33.5	he will fill Zion with his justice and righteousness.
ISA.33.6	He will be the sure foundation for your times,
ISA.33.6	a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge;
ISA.33.6	the fear of the 
ISA.33.7	Look, their brave men cry aloud in the streets;
ISA.33.7	the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
ISA.33.8	The highways are deserted,
ISA.33.8	no travelers are on the roads.
ISA.33.8	The treaty is broken,
ISA.33.8	its witnesses
ISA.33.8	no one is respected.
ISA.33.9	The land dries up and wastes away,
ISA.33.9	Lebanon is ashamed and withers;
ISA.33.9	Sharon is like the Arabah,
ISA.33.9	and Bashan and Carmel drop their leaves.
ISA.33.10	“Now will I arise,” says the 
ISA.33.10	“Now will I be exalted;
ISA.33.10	now will I be lifted up.
ISA.33.11	You conceive chaff,
ISA.33.11	you give birth to straw;
ISA.33.11	your breath is a fire that consumes you.
ISA.33.12	The peoples will be burned to ashes;
ISA.33.12	like cut thornbushes they will be set ablaze.”
ISA.33.13	You who are far away, hear what I have done;
ISA.33.13	you who are near, acknowledge my power!
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Zion are terrified;
ISA.33.14	trembling grips the godless:
ISA.33.14	“Who of us can dwell with the consuming fire?
ISA.33.14	Who of us can dwell with everlasting burning?”
ISA.33.15	Those who walk righteously
ISA.33.15	and speak what is right,
ISA.33.15	who reject gain from extortion
ISA.33.15	and keep their hands from accepting bribes,
ISA.33.15	who stop their ears against plots of murder
ISA.33.15	and shut their eyes against contemplating evil—
ISA.33.16	they are the ones who will dwell on the heights,
ISA.33.16	whose refuge will be the mountain fortress.
ISA.33.16	Their bread will be supplied,
ISA.33.16	and water will not fail them.
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see the king in his beauty
ISA.33.17	and view a land that stretches afar.
ISA.33.18	In your thoughts you will ponder the former terror:
ISA.33.18	“Where is that chief officer?
ISA.33.18	Where is the one who took the revenue?
ISA.33.18	Where is the officer in charge of the towers?”
ISA.33.19	You will see those arrogant people no more,
ISA.33.19	people whose speech is obscure,
ISA.33.19	whose language is strange and incomprehensible.
ISA.33.20	Look on Zion, the city of our festivals;
ISA.33.20	your eyes will see Jerusalem,
ISA.33.20	a peaceful abode, a tent that will not be moved;
ISA.33.20	its stakes will never be pulled up,
ISA.33.20	nor any of its ropes broken.
ISA.33.21	There the 
ISA.33.21	It will be like a place of broad rivers and streams.
ISA.33.21	No galley with oars will ride them,
ISA.33.21	no mighty ship will sail them.
ISA.33.22	For the 
ISA.33.22	the 
ISA.33.22	the 
ISA.33.22	it is he who will save us.
ISA.33.23	Your rigging hangs loose:
ISA.33.23	The mast is not held secure,
ISA.33.23	the sail is not spread.
ISA.33.23	Then an abundance of spoils will be divided
ISA.33.23	and even the lame will carry off plunder.
ISA.33.24	No one living in Zion will say, “I am ill”;
ISA.33.24	and the sins of those who dwell there will be forgiven.
ISA.34.1	Come near, you nations, and listen;
ISA.34.1	pay attention, you peoples!
ISA.34.1	Let the earth hear, and all that is in it,
ISA.34.1	the world, and all that comes out of it!
ISA.34.2	The 
ISA.34.2	his wrath is on all their armies.
ISA.34.2	He will totally destroy
ISA.34.2	he will give them over to slaughter.
ISA.34.3	Their slain will be thrown out,
ISA.34.3	their dead bodies will stink;
ISA.34.3	the mountains will be soaked with their blood.
ISA.34.4	All the stars in the sky will be dissolved
ISA.34.4	and the heavens rolled up like a scroll;
ISA.34.4	all the starry host will fall
ISA.34.4	like withered leaves from the vine,
ISA.34.4	like shriveled figs from the fig tree.
ISA.34.5	My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens;
ISA.34.5	see, it descends in judgment on Edom,
ISA.34.5	the people I have totally destroyed.
ISA.34.6	The sword of the 
ISA.34.6	it is covered with fat—
ISA.34.6	the blood of lambs and goats,
ISA.34.6	fat from the kidneys of rams.
ISA.34.6	For the 
ISA.34.6	and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
ISA.34.7	And the wild oxen will fall with them,
ISA.34.7	the bull calves and the great bulls.
ISA.34.7	Their land will be drenched with blood,
ISA.34.7	and the dust will be soaked with fat.
ISA.34.8	For the 
ISA.34.8	a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s cause.
ISA.34.9	Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch,
ISA.34.9	her dust into burning sulfur;
ISA.34.9	her land will become blazing pitch!
ISA.34.10	It will not be quenched night or day;
ISA.34.10	its smoke will rise forever.
ISA.34.10	From generation to generation it will lie desolate;
ISA.34.10	no one will ever pass through it again.
ISA.34.11	The desert owl
ISA.34.11	the great owl
ISA.34.11	God will stretch out over Edom
ISA.34.11	the measuring line of chaos
ISA.34.11	and the plumb line of desolation.
ISA.34.12	Her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom,
ISA.34.12	all her princes will vanish away.
ISA.34.13	Thorns will overrun her citadels,
ISA.34.13	nettles and brambles her strongholds.
ISA.34.13	She will become a haunt for jackals,
ISA.34.13	a home for owls.
ISA.34.14	Desert creatures will meet with hyenas,
ISA.34.14	and wild goats will bleat to each other;
ISA.34.14	there the night creatures will also lie down
ISA.34.14	and find for themselves places of rest.
ISA.34.15	The owl will nest there and lay eggs,
ISA.34.15	she will hatch them, and care for her young
ISA.34.15	under the shadow of her wings;
ISA.34.15	there also the falcons will gather,
ISA.34.15	each with its mate.
ISA.34.16	Look in the scroll of the 
ISA.34.16	None of these will be missing,
ISA.34.16	not one will lack her mate.
ISA.34.16	For it is his mouth that has given the order,
ISA.34.16	and his Spirit will gather them together.
ISA.34.17	He allots their portions;
ISA.34.17	his hand distributes them by measure.
ISA.34.17	They will possess it forever
ISA.34.17	and dwell there from generation to generation.
ISA.35.1	The desert and the parched land will be glad;
ISA.35.1	the wilderness will rejoice and blossom.
ISA.35.1	Like the crocus, 
ISA.35.2	it will burst into bloom;
ISA.35.2	it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy.
ISA.35.2	The glory of Lebanon will be given to it,
ISA.35.2	the splendor of Carmel and Sharon;
ISA.35.2	they will see the glory of the 
ISA.35.2	the splendor of our God.
ISA.35.3	Strengthen the feeble hands,
ISA.35.3	steady the knees that give way;
ISA.35.4	say to those with fearful hearts,
ISA.35.4	“Be strong, do not fear;
ISA.35.4	your God will come,
ISA.35.4	he will come with vengeance;
ISA.35.4	with divine retribution
ISA.35.4	he will come to save you.”
ISA.35.5	Then will the eyes of the blind be opened
ISA.35.5	and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
ISA.35.6	Then will the lame leap like a deer,
ISA.35.6	and the mute tongue shout for joy.
ISA.35.6	Water will gush forth in the wilderness
ISA.35.6	and streams in the desert.
ISA.35.7	The burning sand will become a pool,
ISA.35.7	the thirsty ground bubbling springs.
ISA.35.7	In the haunts where jackals once lay,
ISA.35.7	grass and reeds and papyrus will grow.
ISA.35.8	And a highway will be there;
ISA.35.8	it will be called the Way of Holiness;
ISA.35.8	it will be for those who walk on that Way.
ISA.35.8	The unclean will not journey on it;
ISA.35.8	wicked fools will not go about on it.
ISA.35.9	No lion will be there,
ISA.35.9	nor any ravenous beast;
ISA.35.9	they will not be found there.
ISA.35.9	But only the redeemed will walk there,
ISA.35.10	and those the 
ISA.35.10	They will enter Zion with singing;
ISA.35.10	everlasting joy will crown their heads.
ISA.35.10	Gladness and joy will overtake them,
ISA.35.10	and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
ISA.36.1	In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
ISA.36.2	Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field, 
ISA.36.3	Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.
ISA.36.4	The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah:
ISA.36.4	“ ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours? 
ISA.36.5	You say you have counsel and might for war—but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? 
ISA.36.6	Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him. 
ISA.36.7	But if you say to me, “We are depending on the 
ISA.36.8	“ ‘Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them! 
ISA.36.9	How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master’s officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen
ISA.36.10	Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the 
ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”
ISA.36.12	But the commander replied, “Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?”
ISA.36.13	Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! 
ISA.36.14	This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you! 
ISA.36.15	Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the 
ISA.36.16	“Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern, 
ISA.36.17	until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
ISA.36.18	“Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, ‘The 
ISA.36.19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand? 
ISA.36.20	Who of all the gods of these countries have been able to save their lands from me? How then can the 
ISA.36.21	But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, “Do not answer him.”
ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.
ISA.37.1	When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the 
ISA.37.2	He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
ISA.37.3	They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the moment of birth and there is no strength to deliver them. 
ISA.37.4	It may be that the 
ISA.37.5	When King Hezekiah’s officials came to Isaiah, 
ISA.37.6	Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘This is what the 
ISA.37.7	Listen! When he hears a certain report, I will make him want to return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.’ ”
ISA.37.8	When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
ISA.37.9	Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the king of Cush,
ISA.37.10	“Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.’ 
ISA.37.11	Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered? 
ISA.37.12	Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver them—the gods of Gozan, Harran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar? 
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath or the king of Arpad? Where are the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah?”
ISA.37.14	Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the 
ISA.37.15	And Hezekiah prayed to the 
ISA.37.16	“
ISA.37.17	Give ear, 
ISA.37.18	“It is true, 
ISA.37.19	They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands. 
ISA.37.20	Now, 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the 
ISA.37.22	this is the word the 
ISA.37.22	“Virgin Daughter Zion
ISA.37.22	despises and mocks you.
ISA.37.22	Daughter Jerusalem
ISA.37.22	tosses her head as you flee.
ISA.37.23	Who is it you have ridiculed and blasphemed?
ISA.37.23	Against whom have you raised your voice
ISA.37.23	and lifted your eyes in pride?
ISA.37.23	Against the Holy One of Israel!
ISA.37.24	By your messengers
ISA.37.24	you have ridiculed the Lord.
ISA.37.24	And you have said,
ISA.37.24	‘With my many chariots
ISA.37.24	I have ascended the heights of the mountains,
ISA.37.24	the utmost heights of Lebanon.
ISA.37.24	I have cut down its tallest cedars,
ISA.37.24	the choicest of its junipers.
ISA.37.24	I have reached its remotest heights,
ISA.37.24	the finest of its forests.
ISA.37.25	I have dug wells in foreign lands
ISA.37.25	and drunk the water there.
ISA.37.25	With the soles of my feet
ISA.37.25	I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.’
ISA.37.26	“Have you not heard?
ISA.37.26	Long ago I ordained it.
ISA.37.26	In days of old I planned it;
ISA.37.26	now I have brought it to pass,
ISA.37.26	that you have turned fortified cities
ISA.37.26	into piles of stone.
ISA.37.27	Their people, drained of power,
ISA.37.27	are dismayed and put to shame.
ISA.37.27	They are like plants in the field,
ISA.37.27	like tender green shoots,
ISA.37.27	like grass sprouting on the roof,
ISA.37.27	scorched
ISA.37.28	“But I know where you are
ISA.37.28	and when you come and go
ISA.37.28	and how you rage against me.
ISA.37.29	Because you rage against me
ISA.37.29	and because your insolence has reached my ears,
ISA.37.29	I will put my hook in your nose
ISA.37.29	and my bit in your mouth,
ISA.37.29	and I will make you return
ISA.37.29	by the way you came.
ISA.37.30	“This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah:
ISA.37.30	“This year you will eat what grows by itself,
ISA.37.30	and the second year what springs from that.
ISA.37.30	But in the third year sow and reap,
ISA.37.30	plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
ISA.37.31	Once more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah
ISA.37.31	will take root below and bear fruit above.
ISA.37.32	For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant,
ISA.37.32	and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors.
ISA.37.32	The zeal of the 
ISA.37.32	will accomplish this.
ISA.37.33	“Therefore this is what the 
ISA.37.33	“He will not enter this city
ISA.37.33	or shoot an arrow here.
ISA.37.33	He will not come before it with shield
ISA.37.33	or build a siege ramp against it.
ISA.37.34	By the way that he came he will return;
ISA.37.34	he will not enter this city,”
ISA.37.34	declares the 
ISA.37.35	“I will defend this city and save it,
ISA.37.35	for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!”
ISA.37.36	Then the angel of the 
ISA.37.37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
ISA.37.38	One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok, his sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
ISA.38.1	In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, “This is what the 
ISA.38.2	Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the 
ISA.38.3	“Remember, 
ISA.38.4	Then the word of the 
ISA.38.5	“Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the 
ISA.38.6	And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.
ISA.38.7	“ ‘This is the 
ISA.38.8	I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.’ ” So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down.
ISA.38.9	A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
ISA.38.10	I said, “In the prime of my life
ISA.38.10	must I go through the gates of death
ISA.38.10	and be robbed of the rest of my years?”
ISA.38.11	I said, “I will not again see the 
ISA.38.11	in the land of the living;
ISA.38.11	no longer will I look on my fellow man,
ISA.38.11	or be with those who now dwell in this world.
ISA.38.12	Like a shepherd’s tent my house
ISA.38.12	has been pulled down and taken from me.
ISA.38.12	Like a weaver I have rolled up my life,
ISA.38.12	and he has cut me off from the loom;
ISA.38.12	day and night you made an end of me.
ISA.38.13	I waited patiently till dawn,
ISA.38.13	but like a lion he broke all my bones;
ISA.38.13	day and night you made an end of me.
ISA.38.14	I cried like a swift or thrush,
ISA.38.14	I moaned like a mourning dove.
ISA.38.14	My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens.
ISA.38.14	I am being threatened; Lord, come to my aid!”
ISA.38.15	But what can I say?
ISA.38.15	He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this.
ISA.38.15	I will walk humbly all my years
ISA.38.15	because of this anguish of my soul.
ISA.38.16	Lord, by such things people live;
ISA.38.16	and my spirit finds life in them too.
ISA.38.16	You restored me to health
ISA.38.16	and let me live.
ISA.38.17	Surely it was for my benefit
ISA.38.17	that I suffered such anguish.
ISA.38.17	In your love you kept me
ISA.38.17	from the pit of destruction;
ISA.38.17	you have put all my sins
ISA.38.17	behind your back.
ISA.38.18	For the grave cannot praise you,
ISA.38.18	death cannot sing your praise;
ISA.38.18	those who go down to the pit
ISA.38.18	cannot hope for your faithfulness.
ISA.38.19	The living, the living—they praise you,
ISA.38.19	as I am doing today;
ISA.38.19	parents tell their children
ISA.38.19	about your faithfulness.
ISA.38.20	The 
ISA.38.20	and we will sing with stringed instruments
ISA.38.20	all the days of our lives
ISA.38.20	in the temple of the 
ISA.38.21	Isaiah had said, “Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”
ISA.38.22	Hezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the 
ISA.39.1	At that time Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of his illness and recovery. 
ISA.39.2	Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine olive oil—his entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
ISA.39.3	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did those men say, and where did they come from?”
ISA.39.3	“From a distant land,” Hezekiah replied. “They came to me from Babylon.”
ISA.39.4	The prophet asked, “What did they see in your palace?”
ISA.39.4	“They saw everything in my palace,” Hezekiah said. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.”
ISA.39.5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the 
ISA.39.6	The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the 
ISA.39.7	And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
ISA.39.8	“The word of the 
ISA.40.1	Comfort, comfort my people,
ISA.40.1	says your God.
ISA.40.2	Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
ISA.40.2	and proclaim to her
ISA.40.2	that her hard service has been completed,
ISA.40.2	that her sin has been paid for,
ISA.40.2	that she has received from the 
ISA.40.2	double for all her sins.
ISA.40.3	A voice of one calling:
ISA.40.3	“In the wilderness prepare
ISA.40.3	the way for the 
ISA.40.3	make straight in the desert
ISA.40.3	a highway for our God.
ISA.40.4	Every valley shall be raised up,
ISA.40.4	every mountain and hill made low;
ISA.40.4	the rough ground shall become level,
ISA.40.4	the rugged places a plain.
ISA.40.5	And the glory of the 
ISA.40.5	and all people will see it together.
ISA.40.5	For the mouth of the 
ISA.40.6	A voice says, “Cry out.”
ISA.40.6	And I said, “What shall I cry?”
ISA.40.6	“All people are like grass,
ISA.40.6	and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field.
ISA.40.7	The grass withers and the flowers fall,
ISA.40.7	because the breath of the 
ISA.40.7	Surely the people are grass.
ISA.40.8	The grass withers and the flowers fall,
ISA.40.8	but the word of our God endures forever.”
ISA.40.9	You who bring good news to Zion,
ISA.40.9	go up on a high mountain.
ISA.40.9	You who bring good news to Jerusalem,
ISA.40.9	lift up your voice with a shout,
ISA.40.9	lift it up, do not be afraid;
ISA.40.9	say to the towns of Judah,
ISA.40.9	“Here is your God!”
ISA.40.10	See, the Sovereign 
ISA.40.10	and he rules with a mighty arm.
ISA.40.10	See, his reward is with him,
ISA.40.10	and his recompense accompanies him.
ISA.40.11	He tends his flock like a shepherd:
ISA.40.11	He gathers the lambs in his arms
ISA.40.11	and carries them close to his heart;
ISA.40.11	he gently leads those that have young.
ISA.40.12	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
ISA.40.12	or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens?
ISA.40.12	Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket,
ISA.40.12	or weighed the mountains on the scales
ISA.40.12	and the hills in a balance?
ISA.40.13	Who can fathom the Spirit
ISA.40.13	or instruct the 
ISA.40.14	Whom did the 
ISA.40.14	and who taught him the right way?
ISA.40.14	Who was it that taught him knowledge,
ISA.40.14	or showed him the path of understanding?
ISA.40.15	Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;
ISA.40.15	they are regarded as dust on the scales;
ISA.40.15	he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust.
ISA.40.16	Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires,
ISA.40.16	nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.
ISA.40.17	Before him all the nations are as nothing;
ISA.40.17	they are regarded by him as worthless
ISA.40.17	and less than nothing.
ISA.40.18	With whom, then, will you compare God?
ISA.40.18	To what image will you liken him?
ISA.40.19	As for an idol, a metalworker casts it,
ISA.40.19	and a goldsmith overlays it with gold
ISA.40.19	and fashions silver chains for it.
ISA.40.20	A person too poor to present such an offering
ISA.40.20	selects wood that will not rot;
ISA.40.20	they look for a skilled worker
ISA.40.20	to set up an idol that will not topple.
ISA.40.21	Do you not know?
ISA.40.21	Have you not heard?
ISA.40.21	Has it not been told you from the beginning?
ISA.40.21	Have you not understood since the earth was founded?
ISA.40.22	He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth,
ISA.40.22	and its people are like grasshoppers.
ISA.40.22	He stretches out the heavens like a canopy,
ISA.40.22	and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
ISA.40.23	He brings princes to naught
ISA.40.23	and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
ISA.40.24	No sooner are they planted,
ISA.40.24	no sooner are they sown,
ISA.40.24	no sooner do they take root in the ground,
ISA.40.24	than he blows on them and they wither,
ISA.40.24	and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.
ISA.40.25	“To whom will you compare me?
ISA.40.25	Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One.
ISA.40.26	Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens:
ISA.40.26	Who created all these?
ISA.40.26	He who brings out the starry host one by one
ISA.40.26	and calls forth each of them by name.
ISA.40.26	Because of his great power and mighty strength,
ISA.40.26	not one of them is missing.
ISA.40.27	Why do you complain, Jacob?
ISA.40.27	Why do you say, Israel,
ISA.40.27	“My way is hidden from the 
ISA.40.27	my cause is disregarded by my God”?
ISA.40.28	Do you not know?
ISA.40.28	Have you not heard?
ISA.40.28	The 
ISA.40.28	the Creator of the ends of the earth.
ISA.40.28	He will not grow tired or weary,
ISA.40.28	and his understanding no one can fathom.
ISA.40.29	He gives strength to the weary
ISA.40.29	and increases the power of the weak.
ISA.40.30	Even youths grow tired and weary,
ISA.40.30	and young men stumble and fall;
ISA.40.31	but those who hope in the 
ISA.40.31	will renew their strength.
ISA.40.31	They will soar on wings like eagles;
ISA.40.31	they will run and not grow weary,
ISA.40.31	they will walk and not be faint.
ISA.41.1	“Be silent before me, you islands!
ISA.41.1	Let the nations renew their strength!
ISA.41.1	Let them come forward and speak;
ISA.41.1	let us meet together at the place of judgment.
ISA.41.2	“Who has stirred up one from the east,
ISA.41.2	calling him in righteousness to his service
ISA.41.2	He hands nations over to him
ISA.41.2	and subdues kings before him.
ISA.41.2	He turns them to dust with his sword,
ISA.41.2	to windblown chaff with his bow.
ISA.41.3	He pursues them and moves on unscathed,
ISA.41.3	by a path his feet have not traveled before.
ISA.41.4	Who has done this and carried it through,
ISA.41.4	calling forth the generations from the beginning?
ISA.41.4	I, the 
ISA.41.4	and with the last—I am he.”
ISA.41.5	The islands have seen it and fear;
ISA.41.5	the ends of the earth tremble.
ISA.41.5	They approach and come forward;
ISA.41.6	they help each other
ISA.41.6	and say to their companions, “Be strong!”
ISA.41.7	The metalworker encourages the goldsmith,
ISA.41.7	and the one who smooths with the hammer
ISA.41.7	spurs on the one who strikes the anvil.
ISA.41.7	One says of the welding, “It is good.”
ISA.41.7	The other nails down the idol so it will not topple.
ISA.41.8	“But you, Israel, my servant,
ISA.41.8	Jacob, whom I have chosen,
ISA.41.8	you descendants of Abraham my friend,
ISA.41.9	I took you from the ends of the earth,
ISA.41.9	from its farthest corners I called you.
ISA.41.9	I said, ‘You are my servant’;
ISA.41.9	I have chosen you and have not rejected you.
ISA.41.10	So do not fear, for I am with you;
ISA.41.10	do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
ISA.41.10	I will strengthen you and help you;
ISA.41.10	I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
ISA.41.11	“All who rage against you
ISA.41.11	will surely be ashamed and disgraced;
ISA.41.11	those who oppose you
ISA.41.11	will be as nothing and perish.
ISA.41.12	Though you search for your enemies,
ISA.41.12	you will not find them.
ISA.41.12	Those who wage war against you
ISA.41.12	will be as nothing at all.
ISA.41.13	For I am the 
ISA.41.13	who takes hold of your right hand
ISA.41.13	and says to you, Do not fear;
ISA.41.13	I will help you.
ISA.41.14	Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob,
ISA.41.14	little Israel, do not fear,
ISA.41.14	for I myself will help you,” declares the 
ISA.41.14	your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.41.15	“See, I will make you into a threshing sledge,
ISA.41.15	new and sharp, with many teeth.
ISA.41.15	You will thresh the mountains and crush them,
ISA.41.15	and reduce the hills to chaff.
ISA.41.16	You will winnow them, the wind will pick them up,
ISA.41.16	and a gale will blow them away.
ISA.41.16	But you will rejoice in the 
ISA.41.16	and glory in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.41.17	“The poor and needy search for water,
ISA.41.17	but there is none;
ISA.41.17	their tongues are parched with thirst.
ISA.41.17	But I the 
ISA.41.17	I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
ISA.41.18	I will make rivers flow on barren heights,
ISA.41.18	and springs within the valleys.
ISA.41.18	I will turn the desert into pools of water,
ISA.41.18	and the parched ground into springs.
ISA.41.19	I will put in the desert
ISA.41.19	the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive.
ISA.41.19	I will set junipers in the wasteland,
ISA.41.19	the fir and the cypress together,
ISA.41.20	so that people may see and know,
ISA.41.20	may consider and understand,
ISA.41.20	that the hand of the 
ISA.41.20	that the Holy One of Israel has created it.
ISA.41.21	“Present your case,” says the 
ISA.41.21	“Set forth your arguments,” says Jacob’s King.
ISA.41.22	“Tell us, you idols,
ISA.41.22	what is going to happen.
ISA.41.22	Tell us what the former things were,
ISA.41.22	so that we may consider them
ISA.41.22	and know their final outcome.
ISA.41.22	Or declare to us the things to come,
ISA.41.23	tell us what the future holds,
ISA.41.23	so we may know that you are gods.
ISA.41.23	Do something, whether good or bad,
ISA.41.23	so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear.
ISA.41.24	But you are less than nothing
ISA.41.24	and your works are utterly worthless;
ISA.41.24	whoever chooses you is detestable.
ISA.41.25	“I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes—
ISA.41.25	one from the rising sun who calls on my name.
ISA.41.25	He treads on rulers as if they were mortar,
ISA.41.25	as if he were a potter treading the clay.
ISA.41.26	Who told of this from the beginning, so we could know,
ISA.41.26	or beforehand, so we could say, ‘He was right’?
ISA.41.26	No one told of this,
ISA.41.26	no one foretold it,
ISA.41.26	no one heard any words from you.
ISA.41.27	I was the first to tell Zion, ‘Look, here they are!’
ISA.41.27	I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good news.
ISA.41.28	I look but there is no one—
ISA.41.28	no one among the gods to give counsel,
ISA.41.28	no one to give answer when I ask them.
ISA.41.29	See, they are all false!
ISA.41.29	Their deeds amount to nothing;
ISA.41.29	their images are but wind and confusion.
ISA.42.1	“Here is my servant, whom I uphold,
ISA.42.1	my chosen one in whom I delight;
ISA.42.1	I will put my Spirit on him,
ISA.42.1	and he will bring justice to the nations.
ISA.42.2	He will not shout or cry out,
ISA.42.2	or raise his voice in the streets.
ISA.42.3	A bruised reed he will not break,
ISA.42.3	and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out.
ISA.42.3	In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;
ISA.42.4	he will not falter or be discouraged
ISA.42.4	till he establishes justice on earth.
ISA.42.4	In his teaching the islands will put their hope.”
ISA.42.5	This is what God the 
ISA.42.5	the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out,
ISA.42.5	who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it,
ISA.42.5	who gives breath to its people,
ISA.42.5	and life to those who walk on it:
ISA.42.6	“I, the 
ISA.42.6	I will take hold of your hand.
ISA.42.6	I will keep you and will make you
ISA.42.6	to be a covenant for the people
ISA.42.6	and a light for the Gentiles,
ISA.42.7	to open eyes that are blind,
ISA.42.7	to free captives from prison
ISA.42.7	and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.
ISA.42.8	“I am the 
ISA.42.8	I will not yield my glory to another
ISA.42.8	or my praise to idols.
ISA.42.9	See, the former things have taken place,
ISA.42.9	and new things I declare;
ISA.42.9	before they spring into being
ISA.42.9	I announce them to you.”
ISA.42.10	Sing to the 
ISA.42.10	his praise from the ends of the earth,
ISA.42.10	you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it,
ISA.42.10	you islands, and all who live in them.
ISA.42.11	Let the wilderness and its towns raise their voices;
ISA.42.11	let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice.
ISA.42.11	Let the people of Sela sing for joy;
ISA.42.11	let them shout from the mountaintops.
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory to the 
ISA.42.12	and proclaim his praise in the islands.
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.13	like a warrior he will stir up his zeal;
ISA.42.13	with a shout he will raise the battle cry
ISA.42.13	and will triumph over his enemies.
ISA.42.14	“For a long time I have kept silent,
ISA.42.14	I have been quiet and held myself back.
ISA.42.14	But now, like a woman in childbirth,
ISA.42.14	I cry out, I gasp and pant.
ISA.42.15	I will lay waste the mountains and hills
ISA.42.15	and dry up all their vegetation;
ISA.42.15	I will turn rivers into islands
ISA.42.15	and dry up the pools.
ISA.42.16	I will lead the blind by ways they have not known,
ISA.42.16	along unfamiliar paths I will guide them;
ISA.42.16	I will turn the darkness into light before them
ISA.42.16	and make the rough places smooth.
ISA.42.16	These are the things I will do;
ISA.42.16	I will not forsake them.
ISA.42.17	But those who trust in idols,
ISA.42.17	who say to images, ‘You are our gods,’
ISA.42.17	will be turned back in utter shame.
ISA.42.18	“Hear, you deaf;
ISA.42.18	look, you blind, and see!
ISA.42.19	Who is blind but my servant,
ISA.42.19	and deaf like the messenger I send?
ISA.42.19	Who is blind like the one in covenant with me,
ISA.42.19	blind like the servant of the 
ISA.42.20	You have seen many things, but you pay no attention;
ISA.42.20	your ears are open, but you do not listen.”
ISA.42.21	It pleased the 
ISA.42.21	for the sake of his righteousness
ISA.42.21	to make his law great and glorious.
ISA.42.22	But this is a people plundered and looted,
ISA.42.22	all of them trapped in pits
ISA.42.22	or hidden away in prisons.
ISA.42.22	They have become plunder,
ISA.42.22	with no one to rescue them;
ISA.42.22	they have been made loot,
ISA.42.22	with no one to say, “Send them back.”
ISA.42.23	Which of you will listen to this
ISA.42.23	or pay close attention in time to come?
ISA.42.24	Who handed Jacob over to become loot,
ISA.42.24	and Israel to the plunderers?
ISA.42.24	Was it not the 
ISA.42.24	against whom we have sinned?
ISA.42.24	For they would not follow his ways;
ISA.42.24	they did not obey his law.
ISA.42.25	So he poured out on them his burning anger,
ISA.42.25	the violence of war.
ISA.42.25	It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand;
ISA.42.25	it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.
ISA.43.1	But now, this is what the 
ISA.43.1	he who created you, Jacob,
ISA.43.1	he who formed you, Israel:
ISA.43.1	“Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
ISA.43.1	I have summoned you by name; you are mine.
ISA.43.2	When you pass through the waters,
ISA.43.2	I will be with you;
ISA.43.2	and when you pass through the rivers,
ISA.43.2	they will not sweep over you.
ISA.43.2	When you walk through the fire,
ISA.43.2	you will not be burned;
ISA.43.2	the flames will not set you ablaze.
ISA.43.3	For I am the 
ISA.43.3	the Holy One of Israel, your Savior;
ISA.43.3	I give Egypt for your ransom,
ISA.43.3	Cush
ISA.43.4	Since you are precious and honored in my sight,
ISA.43.4	and because I love you,
ISA.43.4	I will give people in exchange for you,
ISA.43.4	nations in exchange for your life.
ISA.43.5	Do not be afraid, for I am with you;
ISA.43.5	I will bring your children from the east
ISA.43.5	and gather you from the west.
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’
ISA.43.6	and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.’
ISA.43.6	Bring my sons from afar
ISA.43.6	and my daughters from the ends of the earth—
ISA.43.7	everyone who is called by my name,
ISA.43.7	whom I created for my glory,
ISA.43.7	whom I formed and made.”
ISA.43.8	Lead out those who have eyes but are blind,
ISA.43.8	who have ears but are deaf.
ISA.43.9	All the nations gather together
ISA.43.9	and the peoples assemble.
ISA.43.9	Which of their gods foretold this
ISA.43.9	and proclaimed to us the former things?
ISA.43.9	Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right,
ISA.43.9	so that others may hear and say, “It is true.”
ISA.43.10	“You are my witnesses,” declares the 
ISA.43.10	“and my servant whom I have chosen,
ISA.43.10	so that you may know and believe me
ISA.43.10	and understand that I am he.
ISA.43.10	Before me no god was formed,
ISA.43.10	nor will there be one after me.
ISA.43.11	I, even I, am the 
ISA.43.11	and apart from me there is no savior.
ISA.43.12	I have revealed and saved and proclaimed—
ISA.43.12	I, and not some foreign god among you.
ISA.43.12	You are my witnesses,” declares the 
ISA.43.13	Yes, and from ancient days I am he.
ISA.43.13	No one can deliver out of my hand.
ISA.43.13	When I act, who can reverse it?”
ISA.43.14	This is what the 
ISA.43.14	your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
ISA.43.14	“For your sake I will send to Babylon
ISA.43.14	and bring down as fugitives all the Babylonians,
ISA.43.14	in the ships in which they took pride.
ISA.43.15	I am the 
ISA.43.15	Israel’s Creator, your King.”
ISA.43.16	This is what the 
ISA.43.16	he who made a way through the sea,
ISA.43.16	a path through the mighty waters,
ISA.43.17	who drew out the chariots and horses,
ISA.43.17	the army and reinforcements together,
ISA.43.17	and they lay there, never to rise again,
ISA.43.17	extinguished, snuffed out like a wick:
ISA.43.18	“Forget the former things;
ISA.43.18	do not dwell on the past.
ISA.43.19	See, I am doing a new thing!
ISA.43.19	Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?
ISA.43.19	I am making a way in the wilderness
ISA.43.19	and streams in the wasteland.
ISA.43.20	The wild animals honor me,
ISA.43.20	the jackals and the owls,
ISA.43.20	because I provide water in the wilderness
ISA.43.20	and streams in the wasteland,
ISA.43.20	to give drink to my people, my chosen,
ISA.43.21	the people I formed for myself
ISA.43.21	that they may proclaim my praise.
ISA.43.22	“Yet you have not called on me, Jacob,
ISA.43.22	you have not wearied yourselves for
ISA.43.23	You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings,
ISA.43.23	nor honored me with your sacrifices.
ISA.43.23	I have not burdened you with grain offerings
ISA.43.23	nor wearied you with demands for incense.
ISA.43.24	You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me,
ISA.43.24	or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices.
ISA.43.24	But you have burdened me with your sins
ISA.43.24	and wearied me with your offenses.
ISA.43.25	“I, even I, am he who blots out
ISA.43.25	your transgressions, for my own sake,
ISA.43.25	and remembers your sins no more.
ISA.43.26	Review the past for me,
ISA.43.26	let us argue the matter together;
ISA.43.26	state the case for your innocence.
ISA.43.27	Your first father sinned;
ISA.43.27	those I sent to teach you rebelled against me.
ISA.43.28	So I disgraced the dignitaries of your temple;
ISA.43.28	I consigned Jacob to destruction
ISA.43.28	and Israel to scorn.
ISA.44.1	“But now listen, Jacob, my servant,
ISA.44.1	Israel, whom I have chosen.
ISA.44.2	This is what the 
ISA.44.2	he who made you, who formed you in the womb,
ISA.44.2	and who will help you:
ISA.44.2	Do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant,
ISA.44.2	Jeshurun,
ISA.44.3	For I will pour water on the thirsty land,
ISA.44.3	and streams on the dry ground;
ISA.44.3	I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring,
ISA.44.3	and my blessing on your descendants.
ISA.44.4	They will spring up like grass in a meadow,
ISA.44.4	like poplar trees by flowing streams.
ISA.44.5	Some will say, ‘I belong to the 
ISA.44.5	others will call themselves by the name of Jacob;
ISA.44.5	still others will write on their hand, ‘The 
ISA.44.5	and will take the name Israel.
ISA.44.6	“This is what the 
ISA.44.6	Israel’s King and Redeemer, the 
ISA.44.6	I am the first and I am the last;
ISA.44.6	apart from me there is no God.
ISA.44.7	Who then is like me? Let him proclaim it.
ISA.44.7	Let him declare and lay out before me
ISA.44.7	what has happened since I established my ancient people,
ISA.44.7	and what is yet to come—
ISA.44.7	yes, let them foretell what will come.
ISA.44.8	Do not tremble, do not be afraid.
ISA.44.8	Did I not proclaim this and foretell it long ago?
ISA.44.8	You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me?
ISA.44.8	No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.”
ISA.44.9	All who make idols are nothing,
ISA.44.9	and the things they treasure are worthless.
ISA.44.9	Those who would speak up for them are blind;
ISA.44.9	they are ignorant, to their own shame.
ISA.44.10	Who shapes a god and casts an idol,
ISA.44.10	which can profit nothing?
ISA.44.11	People who do that will be put to shame;
ISA.44.11	such craftsmen are only human beings.
ISA.44.11	Let them all come together and take their stand;
ISA.44.11	they will be brought down to terror and shame.
ISA.44.12	The blacksmith takes a tool
ISA.44.12	and works with it in the coals;
ISA.44.12	he shapes an idol with hammers,
ISA.44.12	he forges it with the might of his arm.
ISA.44.12	He gets hungry and loses his strength;
ISA.44.12	he drinks no water and grows faint.
ISA.44.13	The carpenter measures with a line
ISA.44.13	and makes an outline with a marker;
ISA.44.13	he roughs it out with chisels
ISA.44.13	and marks it with compasses.
ISA.44.13	He shapes it in human form,
ISA.44.13	human form in all its glory,
ISA.44.13	that it may dwell in a shrine.
ISA.44.14	He cut down cedars,
ISA.44.14	or perhaps took a cypress or oak.
ISA.44.14	He let it grow among the trees of the forest,
ISA.44.14	or planted a pine, and the rain made it grow.
ISA.44.15	It is used as fuel for burning;
ISA.44.15	some of it he takes and warms himself,
ISA.44.15	he kindles a fire and bakes bread.
ISA.44.15	But he also fashions a god and worships it;
ISA.44.15	he makes an idol and bows down to it.
ISA.44.16	Half of the wood he burns in the fire;
ISA.44.16	over it he prepares his meal,
ISA.44.16	he roasts his meat and eats his fill.
ISA.44.16	He also warms himself and says,
ISA.44.16	“Ah! I am warm; I see the fire.”
ISA.44.17	From the rest he makes a god, his idol;
ISA.44.17	he bows down to it and worships.
ISA.44.17	He prays to it and says,
ISA.44.17	“Save me! You are my god!”
ISA.44.18	They know nothing, they understand nothing;
ISA.44.18	their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see,
ISA.44.18	and their minds closed so they cannot understand.
ISA.44.19	No one stops to think,
ISA.44.19	no one has the knowledge or understanding to say,
ISA.44.19	“Half of it I used for fuel;
ISA.44.19	I even baked bread over its coals,
ISA.44.19	I roasted meat and I ate.
ISA.44.19	Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left?
ISA.44.19	Shall I bow down to a block of wood?”
ISA.44.20	Such a person feeds on ashes; a deluded heart misleads him;
ISA.44.20	he cannot save himself, or say,
ISA.44.20	“Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?”
ISA.44.21	“Remember these things, Jacob,
ISA.44.21	for you, Israel, are my servant.
ISA.44.21	I have made you, you are my servant;
ISA.44.21	Israel, I will not forget you.
ISA.44.22	I have swept away your offenses like a cloud,
ISA.44.22	your sins like the morning mist.
ISA.44.22	Return to me,
ISA.44.22	for I have redeemed you.”
ISA.44.23	Sing for joy, you heavens, for the 
ISA.44.23	shout aloud, you earth beneath.
ISA.44.23	Burst into song, you mountains,
ISA.44.23	you forests and all your trees,
ISA.44.23	for the 
ISA.44.23	he displays his glory in Israel.
ISA.44.24	“This is what the 
ISA.44.24	your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb:
ISA.44.24	I am the 
ISA.44.24	the Maker of all things,
ISA.44.24	who stretches out the heavens,
ISA.44.24	who spreads out the earth by myself,
ISA.44.25	who foils the signs of false prophets
ISA.44.25	and makes fools of diviners,
ISA.44.25	who overthrows the learning of the wise
ISA.44.25	and turns it into nonsense,
ISA.44.26	who carries out the words of his servants
ISA.44.26	and fulfills the predictions of his messengers,
ISA.44.26	who says of Jerusalem, ‘It shall be inhabited,’
ISA.44.26	of the towns of Judah, ‘They shall be rebuilt,’
ISA.44.26	and of their ruins, ‘I will restore them,’
ISA.44.27	who says to the watery deep, ‘Be dry,
ISA.44.27	and I will dry up your streams,’
ISA.44.28	who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd
ISA.44.28	and will accomplish all that I please;
ISA.44.28	he will say of Jerusalem, “Let it be rebuilt,”
ISA.44.28	and of the temple, “Let its foundations be laid.” ’
ISA.45.1	“This is what the 
ISA.45.1	to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of
ISA.45.1	to subdue nations before him
ISA.45.1	and to strip kings of their armor,
ISA.45.1	to open doors before him
ISA.45.1	so that gates will not be shut:
ISA.45.2	I will go before you
ISA.45.2	and will level the mountains
ISA.45.2	I will break down gates of bronze
ISA.45.2	and cut through bars of iron.
ISA.45.3	I will give you hidden treasures,
ISA.45.3	riches stored in secret places,
ISA.45.3	so that you may know that I am the 
ISA.45.3	the God of Israel, who summons you by name.
ISA.45.4	For the sake of Jacob my servant,
ISA.45.4	of Israel my chosen,
ISA.45.4	I summon you by name
ISA.45.4	and bestow on you a title of honor,
ISA.45.4	though you do not acknowledge me.
ISA.45.5	I am the 
ISA.45.5	apart from me there is no God.
ISA.45.5	I will strengthen you,
ISA.45.5	though you have not acknowledged me,
ISA.45.6	so that from the rising of the sun
ISA.45.6	to the place of its setting
ISA.45.6	people may know there is none besides me.
ISA.45.6	I am the 
ISA.45.7	I form the light and create darkness,
ISA.45.7	I bring prosperity and create disaster;
ISA.45.7	I, the 
ISA.45.8	“You heavens above, rain down my righteousness;
ISA.45.8	let the clouds shower it down.
ISA.45.8	Let the earth open wide,
ISA.45.8	let salvation spring up,
ISA.45.8	let righteousness flourish with it;
ISA.45.8	I, the 
ISA.45.9	“Woe to those who quarrel with their Maker,
ISA.45.9	those who are nothing but potsherds
ISA.45.9	among the potsherds on the ground.
ISA.45.9	Does the clay say to the potter,
ISA.45.9	‘What are you making?’
ISA.45.9	Does your work say,
ISA.45.9	‘The potter has no hands’?
ISA.45.10	Woe to the one who says to a father,
ISA.45.10	‘What have you begotten?’
ISA.45.10	or to a mother,
ISA.45.10	‘What have you brought to birth?’
ISA.45.11	“This is what the 
ISA.45.11	the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker:
ISA.45.11	Concerning things to come,
ISA.45.11	do you question me about my children,
ISA.45.11	or give me orders about the work of my hands?
ISA.45.12	It is I who made the earth
ISA.45.12	and created mankind on it.
ISA.45.12	My own hands stretched out the heavens;
ISA.45.12	I marshaled their starry hosts.
ISA.45.13	I will raise up Cyrus
ISA.45.13	I will make all his ways straight.
ISA.45.13	He will rebuild my city
ISA.45.13	and set my exiles free,
ISA.45.13	but not for a price or reward,
ISA.45.13	says the 
ISA.45.14	This is what the 
ISA.45.14	“The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush,
ISA.45.14	and those tall Sabeans—
ISA.45.14	they will come over to you
ISA.45.14	and will be yours;
ISA.45.14	they will trudge behind you,
ISA.45.14	coming over to you in chains.
ISA.45.14	They will bow down before you
ISA.45.14	and plead with you, saying,
ISA.45.14	‘Surely God is with you, and there is no other;
ISA.45.14	there is no other god.’ ”
ISA.45.15	Truly you are a God who has been hiding himself,
ISA.45.15	the God and Savior of Israel.
ISA.45.16	All the makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced;
ISA.45.16	they will go off into disgrace together.
ISA.45.17	But Israel will be saved by the 
ISA.45.17	with an everlasting salvation;
ISA.45.17	you will never be put to shame or disgraced,
ISA.45.17	to ages everlasting.
ISA.45.18	For this is what the 
ISA.45.18	he who created the heavens,
ISA.45.18	he is God;
ISA.45.18	he who fashioned and made the earth,
ISA.45.18	he founded it;
ISA.45.18	he did not create it to be empty,
ISA.45.18	but formed it to be inhabited—
ISA.45.18	he says:
ISA.45.18	“I am the 
ISA.45.18	and there is no other.
ISA.45.19	I have not spoken in secret,
ISA.45.19	from somewhere in a land of darkness;
ISA.45.19	I have not said to Jacob’s descendants,
ISA.45.19	‘Seek me in vain.’
ISA.45.19	I, the 
ISA.45.19	I declare what is right.
ISA.45.20	“Gather together and come;
ISA.45.20	assemble, you fugitives from the nations.
ISA.45.20	Ignorant are those who carry about idols of wood,
ISA.45.20	who pray to gods that cannot save.
ISA.45.21	Declare what is to be, present it—
ISA.45.21	let them take counsel together.
ISA.45.21	Who foretold this long ago,
ISA.45.21	who declared it from the distant past?
ISA.45.21	Was it not I, the 
ISA.45.21	And there is no God apart from me,
ISA.45.21	a righteous God and a Savior;
ISA.45.21	there is none but me.
ISA.45.22	“Turn to me and be saved,
ISA.45.22	all you ends of the earth;
ISA.45.22	for I am God, and there is no other.
ISA.45.23	By myself I have sworn,
ISA.45.23	my mouth has uttered in all integrity
ISA.45.23	a word that will not be revoked:
ISA.45.23	Before me every knee will bow;
ISA.45.23	by me every tongue will swear.
ISA.45.24	They will say of me, ‘In the 
ISA.45.24	are deliverance and strength.’ ”
ISA.45.24	All who have raged against him
ISA.45.24	will come to him and be put to shame.
ISA.45.25	But all the descendants of Israel
ISA.45.25	will find deliverance in the 
ISA.45.25	and will make their boast in him.
ISA.46.1	Bel bows down, Nebo stoops low;
ISA.46.1	their idols are borne by beasts of burden.
ISA.46.1	The images that are carried about are burdensome,
ISA.46.1	a burden for the weary.
ISA.46.2	They stoop and bow down together;
ISA.46.2	unable to rescue the burden,
ISA.46.2	they themselves go off into captivity.
ISA.46.3	“Listen to me, you descendants of Jacob,
ISA.46.3	all the remnant of the people of Israel,
ISA.46.3	you whom I have upheld since your birth,
ISA.46.3	and have carried since you were born.
ISA.46.4	Even to your old age and gray hairs
ISA.46.4	I am he, I am he who will sustain you.
ISA.46.4	I have made you and I will carry you;
ISA.46.4	I will sustain you and I will rescue you.
ISA.46.5	“With whom will you compare me or count me equal?
ISA.46.5	To whom will you liken me that we may be compared?
ISA.46.6	Some pour out gold from their bags
ISA.46.6	and weigh out silver on the scales;
ISA.46.6	they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god,
ISA.46.6	and they bow down and worship it.
ISA.46.7	They lift it to their shoulders and carry it;
ISA.46.7	they set it up in its place, and there it stands.
ISA.46.7	From that spot it cannot move.
ISA.46.7	Even though someone cries out to it, it cannot answer;
ISA.46.7	it cannot save them from their troubles.
ISA.46.8	“Remember this, keep it in mind,
ISA.46.8	take it to heart, you rebels.
ISA.46.9	Remember the former things, those of long ago;
ISA.46.9	I am God, and there is no other;
ISA.46.9	I am God, and there is none like me.
ISA.46.10	I make known the end from the beginning,
ISA.46.10	from ancient times, what is still to come.
ISA.46.10	I say, ‘My purpose will stand,
ISA.46.10	and I will do all that I please.’
ISA.46.11	From the east I summon a bird of prey;
ISA.46.11	from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my purpose.
ISA.46.11	What I have said, that I will bring about;
ISA.46.11	what I have planned, that I will do.
ISA.46.12	Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted,
ISA.46.12	you who are now far from my righteousness.
ISA.46.13	I am bringing my righteousness near,
ISA.46.13	it is not far away;
ISA.46.13	and my salvation will not be delayed.
ISA.46.13	I will grant salvation to Zion,
ISA.46.13	my splendor to Israel.
ISA.47.1	“Go down, sit in the dust,
ISA.47.1	Virgin Daughter Babylon;
ISA.47.1	sit on the ground without a throne,
ISA.47.1	queen city of the Babylonians.
ISA.47.1	No more will you be called
ISA.47.1	tender or delicate.
ISA.47.2	Take millstones and grind flour;
ISA.47.2	take off your veil.
ISA.47.2	Lift up your skirts, bare your legs,
ISA.47.2	and wade through the streams.
ISA.47.3	Your nakedness will be exposed
ISA.47.3	and your shame uncovered.
ISA.47.3	I will take vengeance;
ISA.47.3	I will spare no one.”
ISA.47.4	Our Redeemer—the 
ISA.47.4	is the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.47.5	“Sit in silence, go into darkness,
ISA.47.5	queen city of the Babylonians;
ISA.47.5	no more will you be called
ISA.47.5	queen of kingdoms.
ISA.47.6	I was angry with my people
ISA.47.6	and desecrated my inheritance;
ISA.47.6	I gave them into your hand,
ISA.47.6	and you showed them no mercy.
ISA.47.6	Even on the aged
ISA.47.6	you laid a very heavy yoke.
ISA.47.7	You said, ‘I am forever—
ISA.47.7	the eternal queen!’
ISA.47.7	But you did not consider these things
ISA.47.7	or reflect on what might happen.
ISA.47.8	“Now then, listen, you lover of pleasure,
ISA.47.8	lounging in your security
ISA.47.8	and saying to yourself,
ISA.47.8	‘I am, and there is none besides me.
ISA.47.8	I will never be a widow
ISA.47.8	or suffer the loss of children.’
ISA.47.9	Both of these will overtake you
ISA.47.9	in a moment, on a single day:
ISA.47.9	loss of children and widowhood.
ISA.47.9	They will come upon you in full measure,
ISA.47.9	in spite of your many sorceries
ISA.47.9	and all your potent spells.
ISA.47.10	You have trusted in your wickedness
ISA.47.10	and have said, ‘No one sees me.’
ISA.47.10	Your wisdom and knowledge mislead you
ISA.47.10	when you say to yourself,
ISA.47.10	‘I am, and there is none besides me.’
ISA.47.11	Disaster will come upon you,
ISA.47.11	and you will not know how to conjure it away.
ISA.47.11	A calamity will fall upon you
ISA.47.11	that you cannot ward off with a ransom;
ISA.47.11	a catastrophe you cannot foresee
ISA.47.11	will suddenly come upon you.
ISA.47.12	“Keep on, then, with your magic spells
ISA.47.12	and with your many sorceries,
ISA.47.12	which you have labored at since childhood.
ISA.47.12	Perhaps you will succeed,
ISA.47.12	perhaps you will cause terror.
ISA.47.13	All the counsel you have received has only worn you out!
ISA.47.13	Let your astrologers come forward,
ISA.47.13	those stargazers who make predictions month by month,
ISA.47.13	let them save you from what is coming upon you.
ISA.47.14	Surely they are like stubble;
ISA.47.14	the fire will burn them up.
ISA.47.14	They cannot even save themselves
ISA.47.14	from the power of the flame.
ISA.47.14	These are not coals for warmth;
ISA.47.14	this is not a fire to sit by.
ISA.47.15	That is all they are to you—
ISA.47.15	these you have dealt with
ISA.47.15	and labored with since childhood.
ISA.47.15	All of them go on in their error;
ISA.47.15	there is not one that can save you.
ISA.48.1	“Listen to this, you descendants of Jacob,
ISA.48.1	you who are called by the name of Israel
ISA.48.1	and come from the line of Judah,
ISA.48.1	you who take oaths in the name of the 
ISA.48.1	and invoke the God of Israel—
ISA.48.1	but not in truth or righteousness—
ISA.48.2	you who call yourselves citizens of the holy city
ISA.48.2	and claim to rely on the God of Israel—
ISA.48.2	the 
ISA.48.3	I foretold the former things long ago,
ISA.48.3	my mouth announced them and I made them known;
ISA.48.3	then suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
ISA.48.4	For I knew how stubborn you were;
ISA.48.4	your neck muscles were iron,
ISA.48.4	your forehead was bronze.
ISA.48.5	Therefore I told you these things long ago;
ISA.48.5	before they happened I announced them to you
ISA.48.5	so that you could not say,
ISA.48.5	‘My images brought them about;
ISA.48.5	my wooden image and metal god ordained them.’
ISA.48.6	You have heard these things; look at them all.
ISA.48.6	Will you not admit them?
ISA.48.6	“From now on I will tell you of new things,
ISA.48.6	of hidden things unknown to you.
ISA.48.7	They are created now, and not long ago;
ISA.48.7	you have not heard of them before today.
ISA.48.7	So you cannot say,
ISA.48.7	‘Yes, I knew of them.’
ISA.48.8	You have neither heard nor understood;
ISA.48.8	from of old your ears have not been open.
ISA.48.8	Well do I know how treacherous you are;
ISA.48.8	you were called a rebel from birth.
ISA.48.9	For my own name’s sake I delay my wrath;
ISA.48.9	for the sake of my praise I hold it back from you,
ISA.48.9	so as not to destroy you completely.
ISA.48.10	See, I have refined you, though not as silver;
ISA.48.10	I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
ISA.48.11	For my own sake, for my own sake, I do this.
ISA.48.11	How can I let myself be defamed?
ISA.48.11	I will not yield my glory to another.
ISA.48.12	“Listen to me, Jacob,
ISA.48.12	Israel, whom I have called:
ISA.48.12	I am he;
ISA.48.12	I am the first and I am the last.
ISA.48.13	My own hand laid the foundations of the earth,
ISA.48.13	and my right hand spread out the heavens;
ISA.48.13	when I summon them,
ISA.48.13	they all stand up together.
ISA.48.14	“Come together, all of you, and listen:
ISA.48.14	Which of the idols has foretold these things?
ISA.48.14	The 
ISA.48.14	will carry out his purpose against Babylon;
ISA.48.14	his arm will be against the Babylonians.
ISA.48.15	I, even I, have spoken;
ISA.48.15	yes, I have called him.
ISA.48.15	I will bring him,
ISA.48.15	and he will succeed in his mission.
ISA.48.16	“Come near me and listen to this:
ISA.48.16	“From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret;
ISA.48.16	at the time it happens, I am there.”
ISA.48.16	And now the Sovereign 
ISA.48.16	endowed with his Spirit.
ISA.48.17	This is what the 
ISA.48.17	your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
ISA.48.17	“I am the 
ISA.48.17	who teaches you what is best for you,
ISA.48.17	who directs you in the way you should go.
ISA.48.18	If only you had paid attention to my commands,
ISA.48.18	your peace would have been like a river,
ISA.48.18	your well-being like the waves of the sea.
ISA.48.19	Your descendants would have been like the sand,
ISA.48.19	your children like its numberless grains;
ISA.48.19	their name would never be blotted out
ISA.48.19	nor destroyed from before me.”
ISA.48.20	Leave Babylon,
ISA.48.20	flee from the Babylonians!
ISA.48.20	Announce this with shouts of joy
ISA.48.20	and proclaim it.
ISA.48.20	Send it out to the ends of the earth;
ISA.48.20	say, “The 
ISA.48.21	They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts;
ISA.48.21	he made water flow for them from the rock;
ISA.48.21	he split the rock
ISA.48.21	and water gushed out.
ISA.48.22	“There is no peace,” says the 
ISA.49.1	Listen to me, you islands;
ISA.49.1	hear this, you distant nations:
ISA.49.1	Before I was born the 
ISA.49.1	from my mother’s womb he has spoken my name.
ISA.49.2	He made my mouth like a sharpened sword,
ISA.49.2	in the shadow of his hand he hid me;
ISA.49.2	he made me into a polished arrow
ISA.49.2	and concealed me in his quiver.
ISA.49.3	He said to me, “You are my servant,
ISA.49.3	Israel, in whom I will display my splendor.”
ISA.49.4	But I said, “I have labored in vain;
ISA.49.4	I have spent my strength for nothing at all.
ISA.49.4	Yet what is due me is in the 
ISA.49.4	and my reward is with my God.”
ISA.49.5	And now the 
ISA.49.5	he who formed me in the womb to be his servant
ISA.49.5	to bring Jacob back to him
ISA.49.5	and gather Israel to himself,
ISA.49.5	for I am
ISA.49.5	and my God has been my strength—
ISA.49.6	he says:
ISA.49.6	“It is too small a thing for you to be my servant
ISA.49.6	to restore the tribes of Jacob
ISA.49.6	and bring back those of Israel I have kept.
ISA.49.6	I will also make you a light for the Gentiles,
ISA.49.6	that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.”
ISA.49.7	This is what the 
ISA.49.7	the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel—
ISA.49.7	to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation,
ISA.49.7	to the servant of rulers:
ISA.49.7	“Kings will see you and stand up,
ISA.49.7	princes will see and bow down,
ISA.49.7	because of the 
ISA.49.7	the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”
ISA.49.8	This is what the 
ISA.49.8	“In the time of my favor I will answer you,
ISA.49.8	and in the day of salvation I will help you;
ISA.49.8	I will keep you and will make you
ISA.49.8	to be a covenant for the people,
ISA.49.8	to restore the land
ISA.49.8	and to reassign its desolate inheritances,
ISA.49.9	to say to the captives, ‘Come out,’
ISA.49.9	and to those in darkness, ‘Be free!’
ISA.49.9	“They will feed beside the roads
ISA.49.9	and find pasture on every barren hill.
ISA.49.10	They will neither hunger nor thirst,
ISA.49.10	nor will the desert heat or the sun beat down on them.
ISA.49.10	He who has compassion on them will guide them
ISA.49.10	and lead them beside springs of water.
ISA.49.11	I will turn all my mountains into roads,
ISA.49.11	and my highways will be raised up.
ISA.49.12	See, they will come from afar—
ISA.49.12	some from the north, some from the west,
ISA.49.12	some from the region of Aswan.
ISA.49.13	Shout for joy, you heavens;
ISA.49.13	rejoice, you earth;
ISA.49.13	burst into song, you mountains!
ISA.49.13	For the 
ISA.49.13	and will have compassion on his afflicted ones.
ISA.49.14	But Zion said, “The 
ISA.49.14	the Lord has forgotten me.”
ISA.49.15	“Can a mother forget the baby at her breast
ISA.49.15	and have no compassion on the child she has borne?
ISA.49.15	Though she may forget,
ISA.49.15	I will not forget you!
ISA.49.16	See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;
ISA.49.16	your walls are ever before me.
ISA.49.17	Your children hasten back,
ISA.49.17	and those who laid you waste depart from you.
ISA.49.18	Lift up your eyes and look around;
ISA.49.18	all your children gather and come to you.
ISA.49.18	As surely as I live,” declares the 
ISA.49.18	“you will wear them all as ornaments;
ISA.49.18	you will put them on, like a bride.
ISA.49.19	“Though you were ruined and made desolate
ISA.49.19	and your land laid waste,
ISA.49.19	now you will be too small for your people,
ISA.49.19	and those who devoured you will be far away.
ISA.49.20	The children born during your bereavement
ISA.49.20	will yet say in your hearing,
ISA.49.20	‘This place is too small for us;
ISA.49.20	give us more space to live in.’
ISA.49.21	Then you will say in your heart,
ISA.49.21	‘Who bore me these?
ISA.49.21	I was bereaved and barren;
ISA.49.21	I was exiled and rejected.
ISA.49.21	Who brought these up?
ISA.49.21	I was left all alone,
ISA.49.21	but these—where have they come from?’ ”
ISA.49.22	This is what the Sovereign 
ISA.49.22	“See, I will beckon to the nations,
ISA.49.22	I will lift up my banner to the peoples;
ISA.49.22	they will bring your sons in their arms
ISA.49.22	and carry your daughters on their hips.
ISA.49.23	Kings will be your foster fathers,
ISA.49.23	and their queens your nursing mothers.
ISA.49.23	They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground;
ISA.49.23	they will lick the dust at your feet.
ISA.49.23	Then you will know that I am the 
ISA.49.23	those who hope in me will not be disappointed.”
ISA.49.24	Can plunder be taken from warriors,
ISA.49.24	or captives be rescued from the fierce
ISA.49.25	But this is what the 
ISA.49.25	“Yes, captives will be taken from warriors,
ISA.49.25	and plunder retrieved from the fierce;
ISA.49.25	I will contend with those who contend with you,
ISA.49.25	and your children I will save.
ISA.49.26	I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh;
ISA.49.26	they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine.
ISA.49.26	Then all mankind will know
ISA.49.26	that I, the 
ISA.49.26	your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
ISA.50.1	This is what the 
ISA.50.1	“Where is your mother’s certificate of divorce
ISA.50.1	with which I sent her away?
ISA.50.1	Or to which of my creditors
ISA.50.1	did I sell you?
ISA.50.1	Because of your sins you were sold;
ISA.50.1	because of your transgressions your mother was sent away.
ISA.50.2	When I came, why was there no one?
ISA.50.2	When I called, why was there no one to answer?
ISA.50.2	Was my arm too short to deliver you?
ISA.50.2	Do I lack the strength to rescue you?
ISA.50.2	By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea,
ISA.50.2	I turn rivers into a desert;
ISA.50.2	their fish rot for lack of water
ISA.50.2	and die of thirst.
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with darkness
ISA.50.3	and make sackcloth its covering.”
ISA.50.4	The Sovereign 
ISA.50.4	to know the word that sustains the weary.
ISA.50.4	He wakens me morning by morning,
ISA.50.4	wakens my ear to listen like one being instructed.
ISA.50.5	The Sovereign 
ISA.50.5	I have not been rebellious,
ISA.50.5	I have not turned away.
ISA.50.6	I offered my back to those who beat me,
ISA.50.6	my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard;
ISA.50.6	I did not hide my face
ISA.50.6	from mocking and spitting.
ISA.50.7	Because the Sovereign 
ISA.50.7	I will not be disgraced.
ISA.50.7	Therefore have I set my face like flint,
ISA.50.7	and I know I will not be put to shame.
ISA.50.8	He who vindicates me is near.
ISA.50.8	Who then will bring charges against me?
ISA.50.8	Let us face each other!
ISA.50.8	Who is my accuser?
ISA.50.8	Let him confront me!
ISA.50.9	It is the Sovereign 
ISA.50.9	Who will condemn me?
ISA.50.9	They will all wear out like a garment;
ISA.50.9	the moths will eat them up.
ISA.50.10	Who among you fears the 
ISA.50.10	and obeys the word of his servant?
ISA.50.10	Let the one who walks in the dark,
ISA.50.10	who has no light,
ISA.50.10	trust in the name of the 
ISA.50.10	and rely on their God.
ISA.50.11	But now, all you who light fires
ISA.50.11	and provide yourselves with flaming torches,
ISA.50.11	go, walk in the light of your fires
ISA.50.11	and of the torches you have set ablaze.
ISA.50.11	This is what you shall receive from my hand:
ISA.50.11	You will lie down in torment.
ISA.51.1	“Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness
ISA.51.1	and who seek the 
ISA.51.1	Look to the rock from which you were cut
ISA.51.1	and to the quarry from which you were hewn;
ISA.51.2	look to Abraham, your father,
ISA.51.2	and to Sarah, who gave you birth.
ISA.51.2	When I called him he was only one man,
ISA.51.2	and I blessed him and made him many.
ISA.51.3	The 
ISA.51.3	and will look with compassion on all her ruins;
ISA.51.3	he will make her deserts like Eden,
ISA.51.3	her wastelands like the garden of the 
ISA.51.3	Joy and gladness will be found in her,
ISA.51.3	thanksgiving and the sound of singing.
ISA.51.4	“Listen to me, my people;
ISA.51.4	hear me, my nation:
ISA.51.4	Instruction will go out from me;
ISA.51.4	my justice will become a light to the nations.
ISA.51.5	My righteousness draws near speedily,
ISA.51.5	my salvation is on the way,
ISA.51.5	and my arm will bring justice to the nations.
ISA.51.5	The islands will look to me
ISA.51.5	and wait in hope for my arm.
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
ISA.51.6	look at the earth beneath;
ISA.51.6	the heavens will vanish like smoke,
ISA.51.6	the earth will wear out like a garment
ISA.51.6	and its inhabitants die like flies.
ISA.51.6	But my salvation will last forever,
ISA.51.6	my righteousness will never fail.
ISA.51.7	“Hear me, you who know what is right,
ISA.51.7	you people who have taken my instruction to heart:
ISA.51.7	Do not fear the reproach of mere mortals
ISA.51.7	or be terrified by their insults.
ISA.51.8	For the moth will eat them up like a garment;
ISA.51.8	the worm will devour them like wool.
ISA.51.8	But my righteousness will last forever,
ISA.51.8	my salvation through all generations.”
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, arm of the 
ISA.51.9	clothe yourself with strength!
ISA.51.9	Awake, as in days gone by,
ISA.51.9	as in generations of old.
ISA.51.9	Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces,
ISA.51.9	who pierced that monster through?
ISA.51.10	Was it not you who dried up the sea,
ISA.51.10	the waters of the great deep,
ISA.51.10	who made a road in the depths of the sea
ISA.51.10	so that the redeemed might cross over?
ISA.51.11	Those the 
ISA.51.11	They will enter Zion with singing;
ISA.51.11	everlasting joy will crown their heads.
ISA.51.11	Gladness and joy will overtake them,
ISA.51.11	and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
ISA.51.12	“I, even I, am he who comforts you.
ISA.51.12	Who are you that you fear mere mortals,
ISA.51.12	human beings who are but grass,
ISA.51.13	that you forget the 
ISA.51.13	who stretches out the heavens
ISA.51.13	and who lays the foundations of the earth,
ISA.51.13	that you live in constant terror every day
ISA.51.13	because of the wrath of the oppressor,
ISA.51.13	who is bent on destruction?
ISA.51.13	For where is the wrath of the oppressor?
ISA.51.14	The cowering prisoners will soon be set free;
ISA.51.14	they will not die in their dungeon,
ISA.51.14	nor will they lack bread.
ISA.51.15	For I am the 
ISA.51.15	who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—
ISA.51.15	the 
ISA.51.16	I have put my words in your mouth
ISA.51.16	and covered you with the shadow of my hand—
ISA.51.16	I who set the heavens in place,
ISA.51.16	who laid the foundations of the earth,
ISA.51.16	and who say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’ ”
ISA.51.17	Awake, awake!
ISA.51.17	Rise up, Jerusalem,
ISA.51.17	you who have drunk from the hand of the 
ISA.51.17	the cup of his wrath,
ISA.51.17	you who have drained to its dregs
ISA.51.17	the goblet that makes people stagger.
ISA.51.18	Among all the children she bore
ISA.51.18	there was none to guide her;
ISA.51.18	among all the children she reared
ISA.51.18	there was none to take her by the hand.
ISA.51.19	These double calamities have come upon you—
ISA.51.19	who can comfort you?—
ISA.51.19	ruin and destruction, famine and sword—
ISA.51.19	who can
ISA.51.20	Your children have fainted;
ISA.51.20	they lie at every street corner,
ISA.51.20	like antelope caught in a net.
ISA.51.20	They are filled with the wrath of the 
ISA.51.20	with the rebuke of your God.
ISA.51.21	Therefore hear this, you afflicted one,
ISA.51.21	made drunk, but not with wine.
ISA.51.22	This is what your Sovereign 
ISA.51.22	your God, who defends his people:
ISA.51.22	“See, I have taken out of your hand
ISA.51.22	the cup that made you stagger;
ISA.51.22	from that cup, the goblet of my wrath,
ISA.51.22	you will never drink again.
ISA.51.23	I will put it into the hands of your tormentors,
ISA.51.23	who said to you,
ISA.51.23	‘Fall prostrate that we may walk on you.’
ISA.51.23	And you made your back like the ground,
ISA.51.23	like a street to be walked on.”
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake, Zion,
ISA.52.1	clothe yourself with strength!
ISA.52.1	Put on your garments of splendor,
ISA.52.1	Jerusalem, the holy city.
ISA.52.1	The uncircumcised and defiled
ISA.52.1	will not enter you again.
ISA.52.2	Shake off your dust;
ISA.52.2	rise up, sit enthroned, Jerusalem.
ISA.52.2	Free yourself from the chains on your neck,
ISA.52.2	Daughter Zion, now a captive.
ISA.52.3	For this is what the 
ISA.52.3	“You were sold for nothing,
ISA.52.3	and without money you will be redeemed.”
ISA.52.4	For this is what the Sovereign 
ISA.52.4	“At first my people went down to Egypt to live;
ISA.52.4	lately, Assyria has oppressed them.
ISA.52.5	“And now what do I have here?” declares the 
ISA.52.5	“For my people have been taken away for nothing,
ISA.52.5	and those who rule them mock,
ISA.52.5	declares the 
ISA.52.5	“And all day long
ISA.52.5	my name is constantly blasphemed.
ISA.52.6	Therefore my people will know my name;
ISA.52.6	therefore in that day they will know
ISA.52.6	that it is I who foretold it.
ISA.52.6	Yes, it is I.”
ISA.52.7	How beautiful on the mountains
ISA.52.7	are the feet of those who bring good news,
ISA.52.7	who proclaim peace,
ISA.52.7	who bring good tidings,
ISA.52.7	who proclaim salvation,
ISA.52.7	who say to Zion,
ISA.52.7	“Your God reigns!”
ISA.52.8	Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices;
ISA.52.8	together they shout for joy.
ISA.52.8	When the 
ISA.52.8	they will see it with their own eyes.
ISA.52.9	Burst into songs of joy together,
ISA.52.9	you ruins of Jerusalem,
ISA.52.9	for the 
ISA.52.9	he has redeemed Jerusalem.
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.10	in the sight of all the nations,
ISA.52.10	and all the ends of the earth will see
ISA.52.10	the salvation of our God.
ISA.52.11	Depart, depart, go out from there!
ISA.52.11	Touch no unclean thing!
ISA.52.11	Come out from it and be pure,
ISA.52.11	you who carry the articles of the 
ISA.52.12	But you will not leave in haste
ISA.52.12	or go in flight;
ISA.52.12	for the 
ISA.52.12	the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
ISA.52.13	See, my servant will act wisely
ISA.52.13	he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.
ISA.52.14	Just as there were many who were appalled at him
ISA.52.14	his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being
ISA.52.14	and his form marred beyond human likeness—
ISA.52.15	so he will sprinkle many nations,
ISA.52.15	and kings will shut their mouths because of him.
ISA.52.15	For what they were not told, they will see,
ISA.52.15	and what they have not heard, they will understand.
ISA.53.1	Who has believed our message
ISA.53.1	and to whom has the arm of the 
ISA.53.2	He grew up before him like a tender shoot,
ISA.53.2	and like a root out of dry ground.
ISA.53.2	He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,
ISA.53.2	nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
ISA.53.3	He was despised and rejected by mankind,
ISA.53.3	a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.
ISA.53.3	Like one from whom people hide their faces
ISA.53.3	he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.
ISA.53.4	Surely he took up our pain
ISA.53.4	and bore our suffering,
ISA.53.4	yet we considered him punished by God,
ISA.53.4	stricken by him, and afflicted.
ISA.53.5	But he was pierced for our transgressions,
ISA.53.5	he was crushed for our iniquities;
ISA.53.5	the punishment that brought us peace was on him,
ISA.53.5	and by his wounds we are healed.
ISA.53.6	We all, like sheep, have gone astray,
ISA.53.6	each of us has turned to our own way;
ISA.53.6	and the 
ISA.53.6	the iniquity of us all.
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed and afflicted,
ISA.53.7	yet he did not open his mouth;
ISA.53.7	he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,
ISA.53.7	and as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
ISA.53.7	so he did not open his mouth.
ISA.53.8	By oppression
ISA.53.8	Yet who of his generation protested?
ISA.53.8	For he was cut off from the land of the living;
ISA.53.8	for the transgression of my people he was punished.
ISA.53.9	He was assigned a grave with the wicked,
ISA.53.9	and with the rich in his death,
ISA.53.9	though he had done no violence,
ISA.53.9	nor was any deceit in his mouth.
ISA.53.10	Yet it was the 
ISA.53.10	and though the 
ISA.53.10	he will see his offspring and prolong his days,
ISA.53.10	and the will of the 
ISA.53.11	After he has suffered,
ISA.53.11	he will see the light of life
ISA.53.11	by his knowledge
ISA.53.11	and he will bear their iniquities.
ISA.53.12	Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,
ISA.53.12	and he will divide the spoils with the strong,
ISA.53.12	because he poured out his life unto death,
ISA.53.12	and was numbered with the transgressors.
ISA.53.12	For he bore the sin of many,
ISA.53.12	and made intercession for the transgressors.
ISA.54.1	“Sing, barren woman,
ISA.54.1	you who never bore a child;
ISA.54.1	burst into song, shout for joy,
ISA.54.1	you who were never in labor;
ISA.54.1	because more are the children of the desolate woman
ISA.54.1	than of her who has a husband,”
ISA.54.1	says the 
ISA.54.2	“Enlarge the place of your tent,
ISA.54.2	stretch your tent curtains wide,
ISA.54.2	do not hold back;
ISA.54.2	lengthen your cords,
ISA.54.2	strengthen your stakes.
ISA.54.3	For you will spread out to the right and to the left;
ISA.54.3	your descendants will dispossess nations
ISA.54.3	and settle in their desolate cities.
ISA.54.4	“Do not be afraid; you will not be put to shame.
ISA.54.4	Do not fear disgrace; you will not be humiliated.
ISA.54.4	You will forget the shame of your youth
ISA.54.4	and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood.
ISA.54.5	For your Maker is your husband—
ISA.54.5	the 
ISA.54.5	the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer;
ISA.54.5	he is called the God of all the earth.
ISA.54.6	The 
ISA.54.6	as if you were a wife deserted and distressed in spirit—
ISA.54.6	a wife who married young,
ISA.54.6	only to be rejected,” says your God.
ISA.54.7	“For a brief moment I abandoned you,
ISA.54.7	but with deep compassion I will bring you back.
ISA.54.8	In a surge of anger
ISA.54.8	I hid my face from you for a moment,
ISA.54.8	but with everlasting kindness
ISA.54.8	I will have compassion on you,”
ISA.54.8	says the 
ISA.54.9	“To me this is like the days of Noah,
ISA.54.9	when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth.
ISA.54.9	So now I have sworn not to be angry with you,
ISA.54.9	never to rebuke you again.
ISA.54.10	Though the mountains be shaken
ISA.54.10	and the hills be removed,
ISA.54.10	yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken
ISA.54.10	nor my covenant of peace be removed,”
ISA.54.10	says the 
ISA.54.11	“Afflicted city, lashed by storms and not comforted,
ISA.54.11	I will rebuild you with stones of turquoise,
ISA.54.11	your foundations with lapis lazuli.
ISA.54.12	I will make your battlements of rubies,
ISA.54.12	your gates of sparkling jewels,
ISA.54.12	and all your walls of precious stones.
ISA.54.13	All your children will be taught by the 
ISA.54.13	and great will be their peace.
ISA.54.14	In righteousness you will be established:
ISA.54.14	Tyranny will be far from you;
ISA.54.14	you will have nothing to fear.
ISA.54.14	Terror will be far removed;
ISA.54.14	it will not come near you.
ISA.54.15	If anyone does attack you, it will not be my doing;
ISA.54.15	whoever attacks you will surrender to you.
ISA.54.16	“See, it is I who created the blacksmith
ISA.54.16	who fans the coals into flame
ISA.54.16	and forges a weapon fit for its work.
ISA.54.16	And it is I who have created the destroyer to wreak havoc;
ISA.54.17	no weapon forged against you will prevail,
ISA.54.17	and you will refute every tongue that accuses you.
ISA.54.17	This is the heritage of the servants of the 
ISA.54.17	and this is their vindication from me,”
ISA.54.17	declares the 
ISA.55.1	“Come, all you who are thirsty,
ISA.55.1	come to the waters;
ISA.55.1	and you who have no money,
ISA.55.1	come, buy and eat!
ISA.55.1	Come, buy wine and milk
ISA.55.1	without money and without cost.
ISA.55.2	Why spend money on what is not bread,
ISA.55.2	and your labor on what does not satisfy?
ISA.55.2	Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good,
ISA.55.2	and you will delight in the richest of fare.
ISA.55.3	Give ear and come to me;
ISA.55.3	listen, that you may live.
ISA.55.3	I will make an everlasting covenant with you,
ISA.55.3	my faithful love promised to David.
ISA.55.4	See, I have made him a witness to the peoples,
ISA.55.4	a ruler and commander of the peoples.
ISA.55.5	Surely you will summon nations you know not,
ISA.55.5	and nations you do not know will come running to you,
ISA.55.5	because of the 
ISA.55.5	the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.55.5	for he has endowed you with splendor.”
ISA.55.6	Seek the 
ISA.55.6	call on him while he is near.
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked forsake their ways
ISA.55.7	and the unrighteous their thoughts.
ISA.55.7	Let them turn to the 
ISA.55.7	and to our God, for he will freely pardon.
ISA.55.8	“For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
ISA.55.8	neither are your ways my ways,”
ISA.55.8	declares the 
ISA.55.9	“As the heavens are higher than the earth,
ISA.55.9	so are my ways higher than your ways
ISA.55.9	and my thoughts than your thoughts.
ISA.55.10	As the rain and the snow
ISA.55.10	come down from heaven,
ISA.55.10	and do not return to it
ISA.55.10	without watering the earth
ISA.55.10	and making it bud and flourish,
ISA.55.10	so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater,
ISA.55.11	so is my word that goes out from my mouth:
ISA.55.11	It will not return to me empty,
ISA.55.11	but will accomplish what I desire
ISA.55.11	and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
ISA.55.12	You will go out in joy
ISA.55.12	and be led forth in peace;
ISA.55.12	the mountains and hills
ISA.55.12	will burst into song before you,
ISA.55.12	and all the trees of the field
ISA.55.12	will clap their hands.
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thornbush will grow the juniper,
ISA.55.13	and instead of briers the myrtle will grow.
ISA.55.13	This will be for the 
ISA.55.13	for an everlasting sign,
ISA.55.13	that will endure forever.”
ISA.56.1	This is what the 
ISA.56.1	“Maintain justice
ISA.56.1	and do what is right,
ISA.56.1	for my salvation is close at hand
ISA.56.1	and my righteousness will soon be revealed.
ISA.56.2	Blessed is the one who does this—
ISA.56.2	the person who holds it fast,
ISA.56.2	who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it,
ISA.56.2	and keeps their hands from doing any evil.”
ISA.56.3	Let no foreigner who is bound to the 
ISA.56.3	“The 
ISA.56.3	And let no eunuch complain,
ISA.56.3	“I am only a dry tree.”
ISA.56.4	For this is what the 
ISA.56.4	“To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,
ISA.56.4	who choose what pleases me
ISA.56.4	and hold fast to my covenant—
ISA.56.5	to them I will give within my temple and its walls
ISA.56.5	a memorial and a name
ISA.56.5	better than sons and daughters;
ISA.56.5	I will give them an everlasting name
ISA.56.5	that will endure forever.
ISA.56.6	And foreigners who bind themselves to the 
ISA.56.6	to minister to him,
ISA.56.6	to love the name of the 
ISA.56.6	and to be his servants,
ISA.56.6	all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it
ISA.56.6	and who hold fast to my covenant—
ISA.56.7	these I will bring to my holy mountain
ISA.56.7	and give them joy in my house of prayer.
ISA.56.7	Their burnt offerings and sacrifices
ISA.56.7	will be accepted on my altar;
ISA.56.7	for my house will be called
ISA.56.7	a house of prayer for all nations.”
ISA.56.8	The Sovereign 
ISA.56.8	he who gathers the exiles of Israel:
ISA.56.8	“I will gather still others to them
ISA.56.8	besides those already gathered.”
ISA.56.9	Come, all you beasts of the field,
ISA.56.9	come and devour, all you beasts of the forest!
ISA.56.10	Israel’s watchmen are blind,
ISA.56.10	they all lack knowledge;
ISA.56.10	they are all mute dogs,
ISA.56.10	they cannot bark;
ISA.56.10	they lie around and dream,
ISA.56.10	they love to sleep.
ISA.56.11	They are dogs with mighty appetites;
ISA.56.11	they never have enough.
ISA.56.11	They are shepherds who lack understanding;
ISA.56.11	they all turn to their own way,
ISA.56.11	they seek their own gain.
ISA.56.12	“Come,” each one cries, “let me get wine!
ISA.56.12	Let us drink our fill of beer!
ISA.56.12	And tomorrow will be like today,
ISA.56.12	or even far better.”
ISA.57.1	The righteous perish,
ISA.57.1	and no one takes it to heart;
ISA.57.1	the devout are taken away,
ISA.57.1	and no one understands
ISA.57.1	that the righteous are taken away
ISA.57.1	to be spared from evil.
ISA.57.2	Those who walk uprightly
ISA.57.2	enter into peace;
ISA.57.2	they find rest as they lie in death.
ISA.57.3	“But you—come here, you children of a sorceress,
ISA.57.3	you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!
ISA.57.4	Who are you mocking?
ISA.57.4	At whom do you sneer
ISA.57.4	and stick out your tongue?
ISA.57.4	Are you not a brood of rebels,
ISA.57.4	the offspring of liars?
ISA.57.5	You burn with lust among the oaks
ISA.57.5	and under every spreading tree;
ISA.57.5	you sacrifice your children in the ravines
ISA.57.5	and under the overhanging crags.
ISA.57.6	The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion;
ISA.57.6	indeed, they are your lot.
ISA.57.6	Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings
ISA.57.6	and offered grain offerings.
ISA.57.6	In view of all this, should I relent?
ISA.57.7	You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill;
ISA.57.7	there you went up to offer your sacrifices.
ISA.57.8	Behind your doors and your doorposts
ISA.57.8	you have put your pagan symbols.
ISA.57.8	Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed,
ISA.57.8	you climbed into it and opened it wide;
ISA.57.8	you made a pact with those whose beds you love,
ISA.57.8	and you looked with lust on their naked bodies.
ISA.57.9	You went to Molek
ISA.57.9	and increased your perfumes.
ISA.57.9	You sent your ambassadors
ISA.57.9	you descended to the very realm of the dead!
ISA.57.10	You wearied yourself by such going about,
ISA.57.10	but you would not say, ‘It is hopeless.’
ISA.57.10	You found renewal of your strength,
ISA.57.10	and so you did not faint.
ISA.57.11	“Whom have you so dreaded and feared
ISA.57.11	that you have not been true to me,
ISA.57.11	and have neither remembered me
ISA.57.11	nor taken this to heart?
ISA.57.11	Is it not because I have long been silent
ISA.57.11	that you do not fear me?
ISA.57.12	I will expose your righteousness and your works,
ISA.57.12	and they will not benefit you.
ISA.57.13	When you cry out for help,
ISA.57.13	let your collection of idols save you!
ISA.57.13	The wind will carry all of them off,
ISA.57.13	a mere breath will blow them away.
ISA.57.13	But whoever takes refuge in me
ISA.57.13	will inherit the land
ISA.57.13	and possess my holy mountain.”
ISA.57.14	And it will be said:
ISA.57.14	“Build up, build up, prepare the road!
ISA.57.14	Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people.”
ISA.57.15	For this is what the high and exalted One says—
ISA.57.15	he who lives forever, whose name is holy:
ISA.57.15	“I live in a high and holy place,
ISA.57.15	but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit,
ISA.57.15	to revive the spirit of the lowly
ISA.57.15	and to revive the heart of the contrite.
ISA.57.16	I will not accuse them forever,
ISA.57.16	nor will I always be angry,
ISA.57.16	for then they would faint away because of me—
ISA.57.16	the very people I have created.
ISA.57.17	I was enraged by their sinful greed;
ISA.57.17	I punished them, and hid my face in anger,
ISA.57.17	yet they kept on in their willful ways.
ISA.57.18	I have seen their ways, but I will heal them;
ISA.57.18	I will guide them and restore comfort to Israel’s mourners,
ISA.57.19	creating praise on their lips.
ISA.57.19	Peace, peace, to those far and near,”
ISA.57.19	says the 
ISA.57.20	But the wicked are like the tossing sea,
ISA.57.20	which cannot rest,
ISA.57.20	whose waves cast up mire and mud.
ISA.57.21	“There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
ISA.58.1	“Shout it aloud, do not hold back.
ISA.58.1	Raise your voice like a trumpet.
ISA.58.1	Declare to my people their rebellion
ISA.58.1	and to the descendants of Jacob their sins.
ISA.58.2	For day after day they seek me out;
ISA.58.2	they seem eager to know my ways,
ISA.58.2	as if they were a nation that does what is right
ISA.58.2	and has not forsaken the commands of its God.
ISA.58.2	They ask me for just decisions
ISA.58.2	and seem eager for God to come near them.
ISA.58.3	‘Why have we fasted,’ they say,
ISA.58.3	‘and you have not seen it?
ISA.58.3	Why have we humbled ourselves,
ISA.58.3	and you have not noticed?’
ISA.58.3	“Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please
ISA.58.3	and exploit all your workers.
ISA.58.4	Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife,
ISA.58.4	and in striking each other with wicked fists.
ISA.58.4	You cannot fast as you do today
ISA.58.4	and expect your voice to be heard on high.
ISA.58.5	Is this the kind of fast I have chosen,
ISA.58.5	only a day for people to humble themselves?
ISA.58.5	Is it only for bowing one’s head like a reed
ISA.58.5	and for lying in sackcloth and ashes?
ISA.58.5	Is that what you call a fast,
ISA.58.5	a day acceptable to the 
ISA.58.6	“Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen:
ISA.58.6	to loose the chains of injustice
ISA.58.6	and untie the cords of the yoke,
ISA.58.6	to set the oppressed free
ISA.58.6	and break every yoke?
ISA.58.7	Is it not to share your food with the hungry
ISA.58.7	and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter—
ISA.58.7	when you see the naked, to clothe them,
ISA.58.7	and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?
ISA.58.8	Then your light will break forth like the dawn,
ISA.58.8	and your healing will quickly appear;
ISA.58.8	then your righteousness
ISA.58.8	and the glory of the 
ISA.58.9	Then you will call, and the 
ISA.58.9	you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I.
ISA.58.9	“If you do away with the yoke of oppression,
ISA.58.9	with the pointing finger and malicious talk,
ISA.58.10	and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry
ISA.58.10	and satisfy the needs of the oppressed,
ISA.58.10	then your light will rise in the darkness,
ISA.58.10	and your night will become like the noonday.
ISA.58.11	The 
ISA.58.11	he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land
ISA.58.11	and will strengthen your frame.
ISA.58.11	You will be like a well-watered garden,
ISA.58.11	like a spring whose waters never fail.
ISA.58.12	Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins
ISA.58.12	and will raise up the age-old foundations;
ISA.58.12	you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls,
ISA.58.12	Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.
ISA.58.13	“If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath
ISA.58.13	and from doing as you please on my holy day,
ISA.58.13	if you call the Sabbath a delight
ISA.58.13	and the 
ISA.58.13	and if you honor it by not going your own way
ISA.58.13	and not doing as you please or speaking idle words,
ISA.58.14	then you will find your joy in the 
ISA.58.14	and I will cause you to ride in triumph on the heights of the land
ISA.58.14	and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob.”
ISA.58.14	The mouth of the 
ISA.59.1	Surely the arm of the 
ISA.59.1	nor his ear too dull to hear.
ISA.59.2	But your iniquities have separated
ISA.59.2	you from your God;
ISA.59.2	your sins have hidden his face from you,
ISA.59.2	so that he will not hear.
ISA.59.3	For your hands are stained with blood,
ISA.59.3	your fingers with guilt.
ISA.59.3	Your lips have spoken falsely,
ISA.59.3	and your tongue mutters wicked things.
ISA.59.4	No one calls for justice;
ISA.59.4	no one pleads a case with integrity.
ISA.59.4	They rely on empty arguments, they utter lies;
ISA.59.4	they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.
ISA.59.5	They hatch the eggs of vipers
ISA.59.5	and spin a spider’s web.
ISA.59.5	Whoever eats their eggs will die,
ISA.59.5	and when one is broken, an adder is hatched.
ISA.59.6	Their cobwebs are useless for clothing;
ISA.59.6	they cannot cover themselves with what they make.
ISA.59.6	Their deeds are evil deeds,
ISA.59.6	and acts of violence are in their hands.
ISA.59.7	Their feet rush into sin;
ISA.59.7	they are swift to shed innocent blood.
ISA.59.7	They pursue evil schemes;
ISA.59.7	acts of violence mark their ways.
ISA.59.8	The way of peace they do not know;
ISA.59.8	there is no justice in their paths.
ISA.59.8	They have turned them into crooked roads;
ISA.59.8	no one who walks along them will know peace.
ISA.59.9	So justice is far from us,
ISA.59.9	and righteousness does not reach us.
ISA.59.9	We look for light, but all is darkness;
ISA.59.9	for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows.
ISA.59.10	Like the blind we grope along the wall,
ISA.59.10	feeling our way like people without eyes.
ISA.59.10	At midday we stumble as if it were twilight;
ISA.59.10	among the strong, we are like the dead.
ISA.59.11	We all growl like bears;
ISA.59.11	we moan mournfully like doves.
ISA.59.11	We look for justice, but find none;
ISA.59.11	for deliverance, but it is far away.
ISA.59.12	For our offenses are many in your sight,
ISA.59.12	and our sins testify against us.
ISA.59.12	Our offenses are ever with us,
ISA.59.12	and we acknowledge our iniquities:
ISA.59.13	rebellion and treachery against the 
ISA.59.13	turning our backs on our God,
ISA.59.13	inciting revolt and oppression,
ISA.59.13	uttering lies our hearts have conceived.
ISA.59.14	So justice is driven back,
ISA.59.14	and righteousness stands at a distance;
ISA.59.14	truth has stumbled in the streets,
ISA.59.14	honesty cannot enter.
ISA.59.15	Truth is nowhere to be found,
ISA.59.15	and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey.
ISA.59.15	The 
ISA.59.15	that there was no justice.
ISA.59.16	He saw that there was no one,
ISA.59.16	he was appalled that there was no one to intervene;
ISA.59.16	so his own arm achieved salvation for him,
ISA.59.16	and his own righteousness sustained him.
ISA.59.17	He put on righteousness as his breastplate,
ISA.59.17	and the helmet of salvation on his head;
ISA.59.17	he put on the garments of vengeance
ISA.59.17	and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak.
ISA.59.18	According to what they have done,
ISA.59.18	so will he repay
ISA.59.18	wrath to his enemies
ISA.59.18	and retribution to his foes;
ISA.59.18	he will repay the islands their due.
ISA.59.19	From the west, people will fear the name of the 
ISA.59.19	and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory.
ISA.59.19	For he will come like a pent-up flood
ISA.59.19	that the breath of the 
ISA.59.20	“The Redeemer will come to Zion,
ISA.59.20	to those in Jacob who repent of their sins,”
ISA.59.20	declares the 
ISA.59.21	“As for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the 
ISA.60.1	“Arise, shine, for your light has come,
ISA.60.1	and the glory of the 
ISA.60.2	See, darkness covers the earth
ISA.60.2	and thick darkness is over the peoples,
ISA.60.2	but the 
ISA.60.2	and his glory appears over you.
ISA.60.3	Nations will come to your light,
ISA.60.3	and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
ISA.60.4	“Lift up your eyes and look about you:
ISA.60.4	All assemble and come to you;
ISA.60.4	your sons come from afar,
ISA.60.4	and your daughters are carried on the hip.
ISA.60.5	Then you will look and be radiant,
ISA.60.5	your heart will throb and swell with joy;
ISA.60.5	the wealth on the seas will be brought to you,
ISA.60.5	to you the riches of the nations will come.
ISA.60.6	Herds of camels will cover your land,
ISA.60.6	young camels of Midian and Ephah.
ISA.60.6	And all from Sheba will come,
ISA.60.6	bearing gold and incense
ISA.60.6	and proclaiming the praise of the 
ISA.60.7	All Kedar’s flocks will be gathered to you,
ISA.60.7	the rams of Nebaioth will serve you;
ISA.60.7	they will be accepted as offerings on my altar,
ISA.60.7	and I will adorn my glorious temple.
ISA.60.8	“Who are these that fly along like clouds,
ISA.60.8	like doves to their nests?
ISA.60.9	Surely the islands look to me;
ISA.60.9	in the lead are the ships of Tarshish,
ISA.60.9	bringing your children from afar,
ISA.60.9	with their silver and gold,
ISA.60.9	to the honor of the 
ISA.60.9	the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.60.9	for he has endowed you with splendor.
ISA.60.10	“Foreigners will rebuild your walls,
ISA.60.10	and their kings will serve you.
ISA.60.10	Though in anger I struck you,
ISA.60.10	in favor I will show you compassion.
ISA.60.11	Your gates will always stand open,
ISA.60.11	they will never be shut, day or night,
ISA.60.11	so that people may bring you the wealth of the nations—
ISA.60.11	their kings led in triumphal procession.
ISA.60.12	For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish;
ISA.60.12	it will be utterly ruined.
ISA.60.13	“The glory of Lebanon will come to you,
ISA.60.13	the juniper, the fir and the cypress together,
ISA.60.13	to adorn my sanctuary;
ISA.60.13	and I will glorify the place for my feet.
ISA.60.14	The children of your oppressors will come bowing before you;
ISA.60.14	all who despise you will bow down at your feet
ISA.60.14	and will call you the City of the 
ISA.60.14	Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.60.15	“Although you have been forsaken and hated,
ISA.60.15	with no one traveling through,
ISA.60.15	I will make you the everlasting pride
ISA.60.15	and the joy of all generations.
ISA.60.16	You will drink the milk of nations
ISA.60.16	and be nursed at royal breasts.
ISA.60.16	Then you will know that I, the 
ISA.60.16	your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
ISA.60.17	Instead of bronze I will bring you gold,
ISA.60.17	and silver in place of iron.
ISA.60.17	Instead of wood I will bring you bronze,
ISA.60.17	and iron in place of stones.
ISA.60.17	I will make peace your governor
ISA.60.17	and well-being your ruler.
ISA.60.18	No longer will violence be heard in your land,
ISA.60.18	nor ruin or destruction within your borders,
ISA.60.18	but you will call your walls Salvation
ISA.60.18	and your gates Praise.
ISA.60.19	The sun will no more be your light by day,
ISA.60.19	nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you,
ISA.60.19	for the 
ISA.60.19	and your God will be your glory.
ISA.60.20	Your sun will never set again,
ISA.60.20	and your moon will wane no more;
ISA.60.20	the 
ISA.60.20	and your days of sorrow will end.
ISA.60.21	Then all your people will be righteous
ISA.60.21	and they will possess the land forever.
ISA.60.21	They are the shoot I have planted,
ISA.60.21	the work of my hands,
ISA.60.21	for the display of my splendor.
ISA.60.22	The least of you will become a thousand,
ISA.60.22	the smallest a mighty nation.
ISA.60.22	I am the 
ISA.60.22	in its time I will do this swiftly.”
ISA.61.1	The Spirit of the Sovereign 
ISA.61.1	because the 
ISA.61.1	to proclaim good news to the poor.
ISA.61.1	He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
ISA.61.1	to proclaim freedom for the captives
ISA.61.1	and release from darkness for the prisoners,
ISA.61.2	to proclaim the year of the 
ISA.61.2	and the day of vengeance of our God,
ISA.61.2	to comfort all who mourn,
ISA.61.3	and provide for those who grieve in Zion—
ISA.61.3	to bestow on them a crown of beauty
ISA.61.3	instead of ashes,
ISA.61.3	the oil of joy
ISA.61.3	instead of mourning,
ISA.61.3	and a garment of praise
ISA.61.3	instead of a spirit of despair.
ISA.61.3	They will be called oaks of righteousness,
ISA.61.3	a planting of the 
ISA.61.3	for the display of his splendor.
ISA.61.4	They will rebuild the ancient ruins
ISA.61.4	and restore the places long devastated;
ISA.61.4	they will renew the ruined cities
ISA.61.4	that have been devastated for generations.
ISA.61.5	Strangers will shepherd your flocks;
ISA.61.5	foreigners will work your fields and vineyards.
ISA.61.6	And you will be called priests of the 
ISA.61.6	you will be named ministers of our God.
ISA.61.6	You will feed on the wealth of nations,
ISA.61.6	and in their riches you will boast.
ISA.61.7	Instead of your shame
ISA.61.7	you will receive a double portion,
ISA.61.7	and instead of disgrace
ISA.61.7	you will rejoice in your inheritance.
ISA.61.7	And so you will inherit a double portion in your land,
ISA.61.7	and everlasting joy will be yours.
ISA.61.8	“For I, the 
ISA.61.8	I hate robbery and wrongdoing.
ISA.61.8	In my faithfulness I will reward my people
ISA.61.8	and make an everlasting covenant with them.
ISA.61.9	Their descendants will be known among the nations
ISA.61.9	and their offspring among the peoples.
ISA.61.9	All who see them will acknowledge
ISA.61.9	that they are a people the 
ISA.61.10	I delight greatly in the 
ISA.61.10	my soul rejoices in my God.
ISA.61.10	For he has clothed me with garments of salvation
ISA.61.10	and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness,
ISA.61.10	as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest,
ISA.61.10	and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
ISA.61.11	For as the soil makes the sprout come up
ISA.61.11	and a garden causes seeds to grow,
ISA.61.11	so the Sovereign 
ISA.61.11	and praise spring up before all nations.
ISA.62.1	For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent,
ISA.62.1	for Jerusalem’s sake I will not remain quiet,
ISA.62.1	till her vindication shines out like the dawn,
ISA.62.1	her salvation like a blazing torch.
ISA.62.2	The nations will see your vindication,
ISA.62.2	and all kings your glory;
ISA.62.2	you will be called by a new name
ISA.62.2	that the mouth of the 
ISA.62.3	You will be a crown of splendor in the 
ISA.62.3	a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
ISA.62.4	No longer will they call you Deserted,
ISA.62.4	or name your land Desolate.
ISA.62.4	But you will be called Hephzibah,
ISA.62.4	and your land Beulah
ISA.62.4	for the 
ISA.62.4	and your land will be married.
ISA.62.5	As a young man marries a young woman,
ISA.62.5	so will your Builder marry you;
ISA.62.5	as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride,
ISA.62.5	so will your God rejoice over you.
ISA.62.6	I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem;
ISA.62.6	they will never be silent day or night.
ISA.62.6	You who call on the 
ISA.62.6	give yourselves no rest,
ISA.62.7	and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem
ISA.62.7	and makes her the praise of the earth.
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.8	and by his mighty arm:
ISA.62.8	“Never again will I give your grain
ISA.62.8	as food for your enemies,
ISA.62.8	and never again will foreigners drink the new wine
ISA.62.8	for which you have toiled;
ISA.62.9	but those who harvest it will eat it
ISA.62.9	and praise the 
ISA.62.9	and those who gather the grapes will drink it
ISA.62.9	in the courts of my sanctuary.”
ISA.62.10	Pass through, pass through the gates!
ISA.62.10	Prepare the way for the people.
ISA.62.10	Build up, build up the highway!
ISA.62.10	Remove the stones.
ISA.62.10	Raise a banner for the nations.
ISA.62.11	The 
ISA.62.11	to the ends of the earth:
ISA.62.11	“Say to Daughter Zion,
ISA.62.11	‘See, your Savior comes!
ISA.62.11	See, his reward is with him,
ISA.62.11	and his recompense accompanies him.’ ”
ISA.62.12	They will be called the Holy People,
ISA.62.12	the Redeemed of the 
ISA.62.12	and you will be called Sought After,
ISA.62.12	the City No Longer Deserted.
ISA.63.1	Who is this coming from Edom,
ISA.63.1	from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson?
ISA.63.1	Who is this, robed in splendor,
ISA.63.1	striding forward in the greatness of his strength?
ISA.63.1	“It is I, proclaiming victory,
ISA.63.1	mighty to save.”
ISA.63.2	Why are your garments red,
ISA.63.2	like those of one treading the winepress?
ISA.63.3	“I have trodden the winepress alone;
ISA.63.3	from the nations no one was with me.
ISA.63.3	I trampled them in my anger
ISA.63.3	and trod them down in my wrath;
ISA.63.3	their blood spattered my garments,
ISA.63.3	and I stained all my clothing.
ISA.63.4	It was for me the day of vengeance;
ISA.63.4	the year for me to redeem had come.
ISA.63.5	I looked, but there was no one to help,
ISA.63.5	I was appalled that no one gave support;
ISA.63.5	so my own arm achieved salvation for me,
ISA.63.5	and my own wrath sustained me.
ISA.63.6	I trampled the nations in my anger;
ISA.63.6	in my wrath I made them drunk
ISA.63.6	and poured their blood on the ground.”
ISA.63.7	I will tell of the kindnesses of the 
ISA.63.7	the deeds for which he is to be praised,
ISA.63.7	according to all the 
ISA.63.7	yes, the many good things
ISA.63.7	he has done for Israel,
ISA.63.7	according to his compassion and many kindnesses.
ISA.63.8	He said, “Surely they are my people,
ISA.63.8	children who will be true to me”;
ISA.63.8	and so he became their Savior.
ISA.63.9	In all their distress he too was distressed,
ISA.63.9	and the angel of his presence saved them.
ISA.63.9	In his love and mercy he redeemed them;
ISA.63.9	he lifted them up and carried them
ISA.63.9	all the days of old.
ISA.63.10	Yet they rebelled
ISA.63.10	and grieved his Holy Spirit.
ISA.63.10	So he turned and became their enemy
ISA.63.10	and he himself fought against them.
ISA.63.11	Then his people recalled
ISA.63.11	the days of Moses and his people—
ISA.63.11	where is he who brought them through the sea,
ISA.63.11	with the shepherd of his flock?
ISA.63.11	Where is he who set
ISA.63.11	his Holy Spirit among them,
ISA.63.12	who sent his glorious arm of power
ISA.63.12	to be at Moses’ right hand,
ISA.63.12	who divided the waters before them,
ISA.63.12	to gain for himself everlasting renown,
ISA.63.13	who led them through the depths?
ISA.63.13	Like a horse in open country,
ISA.63.13	they did not stumble;
ISA.63.14	like cattle that go down to the plain,
ISA.63.14	they were given rest by the Spirit of the 
ISA.63.14	This is how you guided your people
ISA.63.14	to make for yourself a glorious name.
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven and see,
ISA.63.15	from your lofty throne, holy and glorious.
ISA.63.15	Where are your zeal and your might?
ISA.63.15	Your tenderness and compassion are withheld from us.
ISA.63.16	But you are our Father,
ISA.63.16	though Abraham does not know us
ISA.63.16	or Israel acknowledge us;
ISA.63.16	you, 
ISA.63.16	our Redeemer from of old is your name.
ISA.63.17	Why, 
ISA.63.17	and harden our hearts so we do not revere you?
ISA.63.17	Return for the sake of your servants,
ISA.63.17	the tribes that are your inheritance.
ISA.63.18	For a little while your people possessed your holy place,
ISA.63.18	but now our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary.
ISA.63.19	We are yours from of old;
ISA.63.19	but you have not ruled over them,
ISA.63.19	they have not been called
ISA.64.1	Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down,
ISA.64.1	that the mountains would tremble before you!
ISA.64.2	As when fire sets twigs ablaze
ISA.64.2	and causes water to boil,
ISA.64.2	come down to make your name known to your enemies
ISA.64.2	and cause the nations to quake before you!
ISA.64.3	For when you did awesome things that we did not expect,
ISA.64.3	you came down, and the mountains trembled before you.
ISA.64.4	Since ancient times no one has heard,
ISA.64.4	no ear has perceived,
ISA.64.4	no eye has seen any God besides you,
ISA.64.4	who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.
ISA.64.5	You come to the help of those who gladly do right,
ISA.64.5	who remember your ways.
ISA.64.5	But when we continued to sin against them,
ISA.64.5	you were angry.
ISA.64.5	How then can we be saved?
ISA.64.6	All of us have become like one who is unclean,
ISA.64.6	and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags;
ISA.64.6	we all shrivel up like a leaf,
ISA.64.6	and like the wind our sins sweep us away.
ISA.64.7	No one calls on your name
ISA.64.7	or strives to lay hold of you;
ISA.64.7	for you have hidden your face from us
ISA.64.7	and have given us over to
ISA.64.8	Yet you, 
ISA.64.8	We are the clay, you are the potter;
ISA.64.8	we are all the work of your hand.
ISA.64.9	Do not be angry beyond measure, 
ISA.64.9	do not remember our sins forever.
ISA.64.9	Oh, look on us, we pray,
ISA.64.9	for we are all your people.
ISA.64.10	Your sacred cities have become a wasteland;
ISA.64.10	even Zion is a wasteland, Jerusalem a desolation.
ISA.64.11	Our holy and glorious temple, where our ancestors praised you,
ISA.64.11	has been burned with fire,
ISA.64.11	and all that we treasured lies in ruins.
ISA.64.12	After all this, 
ISA.64.12	Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure?
ISA.65.1	“I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me;
ISA.65.1	I was found by those who did not seek me.
ISA.65.1	To a nation that did not call on my name,
ISA.65.1	I said, ‘Here am I, here am I.’
ISA.65.2	All day long I have held out my hands
ISA.65.2	to an obstinate people,
ISA.65.2	who walk in ways not good,
ISA.65.2	pursuing their own imaginations—
ISA.65.3	a people who continually provoke me
ISA.65.3	to my very face,
ISA.65.3	offering sacrifices in gardens
ISA.65.3	and burning incense on altars of brick;
ISA.65.4	who sit among the graves
ISA.65.4	and spend their nights keeping secret vigil;
ISA.65.4	who eat the flesh of pigs,
ISA.65.4	and whose pots hold broth of impure meat;
ISA.65.5	who say, ‘Keep away; don’t come near me,
ISA.65.5	for I am too sacred for you!’
ISA.65.5	Such people are smoke in my nostrils,
ISA.65.5	a fire that keeps burning all day.
ISA.65.6	“See, it stands written before me:
ISA.65.6	I will not keep silent but will pay back in full;
ISA.65.6	I will pay it back into their laps—
ISA.65.7	both your sins and the sins of your ancestors,”
ISA.65.7	says the 
ISA.65.7	“Because they burned sacrifices on the mountains
ISA.65.7	and defied me on the hills,
ISA.65.7	I will measure into their laps
ISA.65.7	the full payment for their former deeds.”
ISA.65.8	This is what the 
ISA.65.8	“As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes
ISA.65.8	and people say, ‘Don’t destroy it,
ISA.65.8	there is still a blessing in it,’
ISA.65.8	so will I do in behalf of my servants;
ISA.65.8	I will not destroy them all.
ISA.65.9	I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,
ISA.65.9	and from Judah those who will possess my mountains;
ISA.65.9	my chosen people will inherit them,
ISA.65.9	and there will my servants live.
ISA.65.10	Sharon will become a pasture for flocks,
ISA.65.10	and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds,
ISA.65.10	for my people who seek me.
ISA.65.11	“But as for you who forsake the 
ISA.65.11	and forget my holy mountain,
ISA.65.11	who spread a table for Fortune
ISA.65.11	and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
ISA.65.12	I will destine you for the sword,
ISA.65.12	and all of you will fall in the slaughter;
ISA.65.12	for I called but you did not answer,
ISA.65.12	I spoke but you did not listen.
ISA.65.12	You did evil in my sight
ISA.65.12	and chose what displeases me.”
ISA.65.13	Therefore this is what the Sovereign 
ISA.65.13	“My servants will eat,
ISA.65.13	but you will go hungry;
ISA.65.13	my servants will drink,
ISA.65.13	but you will go thirsty;
ISA.65.13	my servants will rejoice,
ISA.65.13	but you will be put to shame.
ISA.65.14	My servants will sing
ISA.65.14	out of the joy of their hearts,
ISA.65.14	but you will cry out
ISA.65.14	from anguish of heart
ISA.65.14	and wail in brokenness of spirit.
ISA.65.15	You will leave your name
ISA.65.15	for my chosen ones to use in their curses;
ISA.65.15	the Sovereign 
ISA.65.15	but to his servants he will give another name.
ISA.65.16	Whoever invokes a blessing in the land
ISA.65.16	will do so by the one true God;
ISA.65.16	whoever takes an oath in the land
ISA.65.16	will swear by the one true God.
ISA.65.16	For the past troubles will be forgotten
ISA.65.16	and hidden from my eyes.
ISA.65.17	“See, I will create
ISA.65.17	new heavens and a new earth.
ISA.65.17	The former things will not be remembered,
ISA.65.17	nor will they come to mind.
ISA.65.18	But be glad and rejoice forever
ISA.65.18	in what I will create,
ISA.65.18	for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight
ISA.65.18	and its people a joy.
ISA.65.19	I will rejoice over Jerusalem
ISA.65.19	and take delight in my people;
ISA.65.19	the sound of weeping and of crying
ISA.65.19	will be heard in it no more.
ISA.65.20	“Never again will there be in it
ISA.65.20	an infant who lives but a few days,
ISA.65.20	or an old man who does not live out his years;
ISA.65.20	the one who dies at a hundred
ISA.65.20	will be thought a mere child;
ISA.65.20	the one who fails to reach
ISA.65.20	will be considered accursed.
ISA.65.21	They will build houses and dwell in them;
ISA.65.21	they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
ISA.65.22	No longer will they build houses and others live in them,
ISA.65.22	or plant and others eat.
ISA.65.22	For as the days of a tree,
ISA.65.22	so will be the days of my people;
ISA.65.22	my chosen ones will long enjoy
ISA.65.22	the work of their hands.
ISA.65.23	They will not labor in vain,
ISA.65.23	nor will they bear children doomed to misfortune;
ISA.65.23	for they will be a people blessed by the 
ISA.65.23	they and their descendants with them.
ISA.65.24	Before they call I will answer;
ISA.65.24	while they are still speaking I will hear.
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb will feed together,
ISA.65.25	and the lion will eat straw like the ox,
ISA.65.25	and dust will be the serpent’s food.
ISA.65.25	They will neither harm nor destroy
ISA.65.25	on all my holy mountain,”
ISA.65.25	says the 
ISA.66.1	This is what the 
ISA.66.1	“Heaven is my throne,
ISA.66.1	and the earth is my footstool.
ISA.66.1	Where is the house you will build for me?
ISA.66.1	Where will my resting place be?
ISA.66.2	Has not my hand made all these things,
ISA.66.2	and so they came into being?”
ISA.66.2	declares the 
ISA.66.2	“These are the ones I look on with favor:
ISA.66.2	those who are humble and contrite in spirit,
ISA.66.2	and who tremble at my word.
ISA.66.3	But whoever sacrifices a bull
ISA.66.3	is like one who kills a person,
ISA.66.3	and whoever offers a lamb
ISA.66.3	is like one who breaks a dog’s neck;
ISA.66.3	whoever makes a grain offering
ISA.66.3	is like one who presents pig’s blood,
ISA.66.3	and whoever burns memorial incense
ISA.66.3	is like one who worships an idol.
ISA.66.3	They have chosen their own ways,
ISA.66.3	and they delight in their abominations;
ISA.66.4	so I also will choose harsh treatment for them
ISA.66.4	and will bring on them what they dread.
ISA.66.4	For when I called, no one answered,
ISA.66.4	when I spoke, no one listened.
ISA.66.4	They did evil in my sight
ISA.66.4	and chose what displeases me.”
ISA.66.5	Hear the word of the 
ISA.66.5	you who tremble at his word:
ISA.66.5	“Your own people who hate you,
ISA.66.5	and exclude you because of my name, have said,
ISA.66.5	‘Let the 
ISA.66.5	that we may see your joy!’
ISA.66.5	Yet they will be put to shame.
ISA.66.6	Hear that uproar from the city,
ISA.66.6	hear that noise from the temple!
ISA.66.6	It is the sound of the 
ISA.66.6	repaying his enemies all they deserve.
ISA.66.7	“Before she goes into labor,
ISA.66.7	she gives birth;
ISA.66.7	before the pains come upon her,
ISA.66.7	she delivers a son.
ISA.66.8	Who has ever heard of such things?
ISA.66.8	Who has ever seen things like this?
ISA.66.8	Can a country be born in a day
ISA.66.8	or a nation be brought forth in a moment?
ISA.66.8	Yet no sooner is Zion in labor
ISA.66.8	than she gives birth to her children.
ISA.66.9	Do I bring to the moment of birth
ISA.66.9	and not give delivery?” says the 
ISA.66.9	“Do I close up the womb
ISA.66.9	when I bring to delivery?” says your God.
ISA.66.10	“Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her,
ISA.66.10	all you who love her;
ISA.66.10	rejoice greatly with her,
ISA.66.10	all you who mourn over her.
ISA.66.11	For you will nurse and be satisfied
ISA.66.11	at her comforting breasts;
ISA.66.11	you will drink deeply
ISA.66.11	and delight in her overflowing abundance.”
ISA.66.12	For this is what the 
ISA.66.12	“I will extend peace to her like a river,
ISA.66.12	and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream;
ISA.66.12	you will nurse and be carried on her arm
ISA.66.12	and dandled on her knees.
ISA.66.13	As a mother comforts her child,
ISA.66.13	so will I comfort you;
ISA.66.13	and you will be comforted over Jerusalem.”
ISA.66.14	When you see this, your heart will rejoice
ISA.66.14	and you will flourish like grass;
ISA.66.14	the hand of the 
ISA.66.14	but his fury will be shown to his foes.
ISA.66.15	See, the 
ISA.66.15	and his chariots are like a whirlwind;
ISA.66.15	he will bring down his anger with fury,
ISA.66.15	and his rebuke with flames of fire.
ISA.66.16	For with fire and with his sword
ISA.66.16	the 
ISA.66.16	and many will be those slain by the 
ISA.66.17	“Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one who is among those who eat the flesh of pigs, rats and other unclean things—they will meet their end together with the one they follow,” declares the 
ISA.66.18	“And I, because of what they have planned and done, am about to come
ISA.66.19	“I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations—to Tarshish, to the Libyans
ISA.66.20	And they will bring all your people, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the 
ISA.66.21	And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites,” says the 
ISA.66.22	“As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,” declares the 
ISA.66.23	From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,” says the 
ISA.66.24	“And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”
JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. 
JER.1.2	The word of the 
JER.1.3	and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.
JER.1.4	The word of the 
JER.1.5	“Before I formed you in the womb I knew
JER.1.5	before you were born I set you apart;
JER.1.5	I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”
JER.1.6	“Alas, Sovereign 
JER.1.7	But the 
JER.1.8	Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.10	See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.”
JER.1.11	The word of the 
JER.1.11	“I see the branch of an almond tree,” I replied.
JER.1.12	The 
JER.1.13	The word of the 
JER.1.13	“I see a pot that is boiling,” I answered. “It is tilting toward us from the north.”
JER.1.14	The 
JER.1.15	I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms,” declares the 
JER.1.15	“Their kings will come and set up their thrones
JER.1.15	in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem;
JER.1.15	they will come against all her surrounding walls
JER.1.15	and against all the towns of Judah.
JER.1.16	I will pronounce my judgments on my people
JER.1.16	because of their wickedness in forsaking me,
JER.1.16	in burning incense to other gods
JER.1.16	and in worshiping what their hands have made.
JER.1.17	“Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them. 
JER.1.18	Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and the people of the land. 
JER.1.19	They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the 
JER.2.1	The word of the 
JER.2.2	“Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem:
JER.2.2	“This is what the 
JER.2.2	“ ‘I remember the devotion of your youth,
JER.2.2	how as a bride you loved me
JER.2.2	and followed me through the wilderness,
JER.2.2	through a land not sown.
JER.2.3	Israel was holy to the 
JER.2.3	the firstfruits of his harvest;
JER.2.3	all who devoured her were held guilty,
JER.2.3	and disaster overtook them,’ ”
JER.2.3	declares the 
JER.2.4	Hear the word of the 
JER.2.4	all you clans of Israel.
JER.2.5	This is what the 
JER.2.5	“What fault did your ancestors find in me,
JER.2.5	that they strayed so far from me?
JER.2.5	They followed worthless idols
JER.2.5	and became worthless themselves.
JER.2.6	They did not ask, ‘Where is the 
JER.2.6	who brought us up out of Egypt
JER.2.6	and led us through the barren wilderness,
JER.2.6	through a land of deserts and ravines,
JER.2.6	a land of drought and utter darkness,
JER.2.6	a land where no one travels and no one lives?’
JER.2.7	I brought you into a fertile land
JER.2.7	to eat its fruit and rich produce.
JER.2.7	But you came and defiled my land
JER.2.7	and made my inheritance detestable.
JER.2.8	The priests did not ask,
JER.2.8	‘Where is the 
JER.2.8	Those who deal with the law did not know me;
JER.2.8	the leaders rebelled against me.
JER.2.8	The prophets prophesied by Baal,
JER.2.8	following worthless idols.
JER.2.9	“Therefore I bring charges against you again,”
JER.2.9	declares the 
JER.2.9	“And I will bring charges against your children’s children.
JER.2.10	Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus and look,
JER.2.10	send to Kedar
JER.2.10	see if there has ever been anything like this:
JER.2.11	Has a nation ever changed its gods?
JER.2.11	(Yet they are not gods at all.)
JER.2.11	But my people have exchanged their glorious God
JER.2.11	for worthless idols.
JER.2.12	Be appalled at this, you heavens,
JER.2.12	and shudder with great horror,”
JER.2.12	declares the 
JER.2.13	“My people have committed two sins:
JER.2.13	They have forsaken me,
JER.2.13	the spring of living water,
JER.2.13	and have dug their own cisterns,
JER.2.13	broken cisterns that cannot hold water.
JER.2.14	Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth?
JER.2.14	Why then has he become plunder?
JER.2.15	Lions have roared;
JER.2.15	they have growled at him.
JER.2.15	They have laid waste his land;
JER.2.15	his towns are burned and deserted.
JER.2.16	Also, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes
JER.2.16	have cracked your skull.
JER.2.17	Have you not brought this on yourselves
JER.2.17	by forsaking the 
JER.2.17	when he led you in the way?
JER.2.18	Now why go to Egypt
JER.2.18	to drink water from the Nile
JER.2.18	And why go to Assyria
JER.2.18	to drink water from the Euphrates?
JER.2.19	Your wickedness will punish you;
JER.2.19	your backsliding will rebuke you.
JER.2.19	Consider then and realize
JER.2.19	how evil and bitter it is for you
JER.2.19	when you forsake the 
JER.2.19	and have no awe of me,”
JER.2.19	declares the Lord, the 
JER.2.20	“Long ago you broke off your yoke
JER.2.20	and tore off your bonds;
JER.2.20	you said, ‘I will not serve you!’
JER.2.20	Indeed, on every high hill
JER.2.20	and under every spreading tree
JER.2.20	you lay down as a prostitute.
JER.2.21	I had planted you like a choice vine
JER.2.21	of sound and reliable stock.
JER.2.21	How then did you turn against me
JER.2.21	into a corrupt, wild vine?
JER.2.22	Although you wash yourself with soap
JER.2.22	and use an abundance of cleansing powder,
JER.2.22	the stain of your guilt is still before me,”
JER.2.22	declares the Sovereign 
JER.2.23	“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled;
JER.2.23	I have not run after the Baals’?
JER.2.23	See how you behaved in the valley;
JER.2.23	consider what you have done.
JER.2.23	You are a swift she-camel
JER.2.23	running here and there,
JER.2.24	a wild donkey accustomed to the desert,
JER.2.24	sniffing the wind in her craving—
JER.2.24	in her heat who can restrain her?
JER.2.24	Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves;
JER.2.24	at mating time they will find her.
JER.2.25	Do not run until your feet are bare
JER.2.25	and your throat is dry.
JER.2.25	But you said, ‘It’s no use!
JER.2.25	I love foreign gods,
JER.2.25	and I must go after them.’
JER.2.26	“As a thief is disgraced when he is caught,
JER.2.26	so the people of Israel are disgraced—
JER.2.26	they, their kings and their officials,
JER.2.26	their priests and their prophets.
JER.2.27	They say to wood, ‘You are my father,’
JER.2.27	and to stone, ‘You gave me birth.’
JER.2.27	They have turned their backs to me
JER.2.27	and not their faces;
JER.2.27	yet when they are in trouble, they say,
JER.2.27	‘Come and save us!’
JER.2.28	Where then are the gods you made for yourselves?
JER.2.28	Let them come if they can save you
JER.2.28	when you are in trouble!
JER.2.28	For you, Judah, have as many gods
JER.2.28	as you have towns.
JER.2.29	“Why do you bring charges against me?
JER.2.29	You have all rebelled against me,”
JER.2.29	declares the 
JER.2.30	“In vain I punished your people;
JER.2.30	they did not respond to correction.
JER.2.30	Your sword has devoured your prophets
JER.2.30	like a ravenous lion.
JER.2.31	“You of this generation, consider the word of the 
JER.2.31	“Have I been a desert to Israel
JER.2.31	or a land of great darkness?
JER.2.31	Why do my people say, ‘We are free to roam;
JER.2.31	we will come to you no more’?
JER.2.32	Does a young woman forget her jewelry,
JER.2.32	a bride her wedding ornaments?
JER.2.32	Yet my people have forgotten me,
JER.2.32	days without number.
JER.2.33	How skilled you are at pursuing love!
JER.2.33	Even the worst of women can learn from your ways.
JER.2.34	On your clothes is found
JER.2.34	the lifeblood of the innocent poor,
JER.2.34	though you did not catch them breaking in.
JER.2.34	Yet in spite of all this
JER.2.35	you say, ‘I am innocent;
JER.2.35	he is not angry with me.’
JER.2.35	But I will pass judgment on you
JER.2.35	because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’
JER.2.36	Why do you go about so much,
JER.2.36	changing your ways?
JER.2.36	You will be disappointed by Egypt
JER.2.36	as you were by Assyria.
JER.2.37	You will also leave that place
JER.2.37	with your hands on your head,
JER.2.37	for the 
JER.2.37	you will not be helped by them.
JER.3.1	“If a man divorces his wife
JER.3.1	and she leaves him and marries another man,
JER.3.1	should he return to her again?
JER.3.1	Would not the land be completely defiled?
JER.3.1	But you have lived as a prostitute with many lovers—
JER.3.1	would you now return to me?”
JER.3.1	declares the 
JER.3.2	“Look up to the barren heights and see.
JER.3.2	Is there any place where you have not been ravished?
JER.3.2	By the roadside you sat waiting for lovers,
JER.3.2	sat like a nomad in the desert.
JER.3.2	You have defiled the land
JER.3.2	with your prostitution and wickedness.
JER.3.3	Therefore the showers have been withheld,
JER.3.3	and no spring rains have fallen.
JER.3.3	Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute;
JER.3.3	you refuse to blush with shame.
JER.3.4	Have you not just called to me:
JER.3.4	‘My Father, my friend from my youth,
JER.3.5	will you always be angry?
JER.3.5	Will your wrath continue forever?’
JER.3.5	This is how you talk,
JER.3.5	but you do all the evil you can.”
JER.3.6	During the reign of King Josiah, the 
JER.3.7	I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it. 
JER.3.8	I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she also went out and committed adultery. 
JER.3.9	Because Israel’s immorality mattered so little to her, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood. 
JER.3.10	In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense,” declares the 
JER.3.11	The 
JER.3.12	Go, proclaim this message toward the north:
JER.3.12	“ ‘Return, faithless Israel,’ declares the 
JER.3.12	‘I will frown on you no longer,
JER.3.12	for I am faithful,’ declares the 
JER.3.12	‘I will not be angry forever.
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge your guilt—
JER.3.13	you have rebelled against the 
JER.3.13	you have scattered your favors to foreign gods
JER.3.13	under every spreading tree,
JER.3.13	and have not obeyed me,’ ”
JER.3.13	declares the 
JER.3.14	“Return, faithless people,” declares the 
JER.3.15	Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding. 
JER.3.16	In those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land,” declares the 
JER.3.17	At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the 
JER.3.18	In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance.
JER.3.19	“I myself said,
JER.3.19	“ ‘How gladly would I treat you like my children
JER.3.19	and give you a pleasant land,
JER.3.19	the most beautiful inheritance of any nation.’
JER.3.19	I thought you would call me ‘Father’
JER.3.19	and not turn away from following me.
JER.3.20	But like a woman unfaithful to her husband,
JER.3.20	so you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me,”
JER.3.20	declares the 
JER.3.21	A cry is heard on the barren heights,
JER.3.21	the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel,
JER.3.21	because they have perverted their ways
JER.3.21	and have forgotten the 
JER.3.22	“Return, faithless people;
JER.3.22	I will cure you of backsliding.”
JER.3.22	“Yes, we will come to you,
JER.3.22	for you are the 
JER.3.23	Surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills
JER.3.23	and mountains is a deception;
JER.3.23	surely in the 
JER.3.23	is the salvation of Israel.
JER.3.24	From our youth shameful gods have consumed
JER.3.24	the fruits of our ancestors’ labor—
JER.3.24	their flocks and herds,
JER.3.24	their sons and daughters.
JER.3.25	Let us lie down in our shame,
JER.3.25	and let our disgrace cover us.
JER.3.25	We have sinned against the 
JER.3.25	both we and our ancestors;
JER.3.25	from our youth till this day
JER.3.25	we have not obeyed the 
JER.4.1	“If you, Israel, will return,
JER.4.1	then return to me,”
JER.4.1	declares the 
JER.4.1	“If you put your detestable idols out of my sight
JER.4.1	and no longer go astray,
JER.4.2	and if in a truthful, just and righteous way
JER.4.2	you swear, ‘As surely as the 
JER.4.2	then the nations will invoke blessings by him
JER.4.2	and in him they will boast.”
JER.4.3	This is what the 
JER.4.3	“Break up your unplowed ground
JER.4.3	and do not sow among thorns.
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to the 
JER.4.4	circumcise your hearts,
JER.4.4	you people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem,
JER.4.4	or my wrath will flare up and burn like fire
JER.4.4	because of the evil you have done—
JER.4.4	burn with no one to quench it.
JER.4.5	“Announce in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say:
JER.4.5	‘Sound the trumpet throughout the land!’
JER.4.5	Cry aloud and say:
JER.4.5	‘Gather together!
JER.4.5	Let us flee to the fortified cities!’
JER.4.6	Raise the signal to go to Zion!
JER.4.6	Flee for safety without delay!
JER.4.6	For I am bringing disaster from the north,
JER.4.6	even terrible destruction.”
JER.4.7	A lion has come out of his lair;
JER.4.7	a destroyer of nations has set out.
JER.4.7	He has left his place
JER.4.7	to lay waste your land.
JER.4.7	Your towns will lie in ruins
JER.4.7	without inhabitant.
JER.4.8	So put on sackcloth,
JER.4.8	lament and wail,
JER.4.8	for the fierce anger of the 
JER.4.8	has not turned away from us.
JER.4.9	“In that day,” declares the 
JER.4.9	“the king and the officials will lose heart,
JER.4.9	the priests will be horrified,
JER.4.9	and the prophets will be appalled.”
JER.4.10	Then I said, “Alas, Sovereign 
JER.4.11	At that time this people and Jerusalem will be told, “A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people, but not to winnow or cleanse; 
JER.4.12	a wind too strong for that comes from me. Now I pronounce my judgments against them.”
JER.4.13	Look! He advances like the clouds,
JER.4.13	his chariots come like a whirlwind,
JER.4.13	his horses are swifter than eagles.
JER.4.13	Woe to us! We are ruined!
JER.4.14	Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart and be saved.
JER.4.14	How long will you harbor wicked thoughts?
JER.4.15	A voice is announcing from Dan,
JER.4.15	proclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim.
JER.4.16	“Tell this to the nations,
JER.4.16	proclaim concerning Jerusalem:
JER.4.16	‘A besieging army is coming from a distant land,
JER.4.16	raising a war cry against the cities of Judah.
JER.4.17	They surround her like men guarding a field,
JER.4.17	because she has rebelled against me,’ ”
JER.4.17	declares the 
JER.4.18	“Your own conduct and actions
JER.4.18	have brought this on you.
JER.4.18	This is your punishment.
JER.4.18	How bitter it is!
JER.4.18	How it pierces to the heart!”
JER.4.19	Oh, my anguish, my anguish!
JER.4.19	I writhe in pain.
JER.4.19	Oh, the agony of my heart!
JER.4.19	My heart pounds within me,
JER.4.19	I cannot keep silent.
JER.4.19	For I have heard the sound of the trumpet;
JER.4.19	I have heard the battle cry.
JER.4.20	Disaster follows disaster;
JER.4.20	the whole land lies in ruins.
JER.4.20	In an instant my tents are destroyed,
JER.4.20	my shelter in a moment.
JER.4.21	How long must I see the battle standard
JER.4.21	and hear the sound of the trumpet?
JER.4.22	“My people are fools;
JER.4.22	they do not know me.
JER.4.22	They are senseless children;
JER.4.22	they have no understanding.
JER.4.22	They are skilled in doing evil;
JER.4.22	they know not how to do good.”
JER.4.23	I looked at the earth,
JER.4.23	and it was formless and empty;
JER.4.23	and at the heavens,
JER.4.23	and their light was gone.
JER.4.24	I looked at the mountains,
JER.4.24	and they were quaking;
JER.4.24	all the hills were swaying.
JER.4.25	I looked, and there were no people;
JER.4.25	every bird in the sky had flown away.
JER.4.26	I looked, and the fruitful land was a desert;
JER.4.26	all its towns lay in ruins
JER.4.26	before the 
JER.4.27	This is what the 
JER.4.27	“The whole land will be ruined,
JER.4.27	though I will not destroy it completely.
JER.4.28	Therefore the earth will mourn
JER.4.28	and the heavens above grow dark,
JER.4.28	because I have spoken and will not relent,
JER.4.28	I have decided and will not turn back.”
JER.4.29	At the sound of horsemen and archers
JER.4.29	every town takes to flight.
JER.4.29	Some go into the thickets;
JER.4.29	some climb up among the rocks.
JER.4.29	All the towns are deserted;
JER.4.29	no one lives in them.
JER.4.30	What are you doing, you devastated one?
JER.4.30	Why dress yourself in scarlet
JER.4.30	and put on jewels of gold?
JER.4.30	Why highlight your eyes with makeup?
JER.4.30	You adorn yourself in vain.
JER.4.30	Your lovers despise you;
JER.4.30	they want to kill you.
JER.4.31	I hear a cry as of a woman in labor,
JER.4.31	a groan as of one bearing her first child—
JER.4.31	the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath,
JER.4.31	stretching out her hands and saying,
JER.4.31	“Alas! I am fainting;
JER.4.31	my life is given over to murderers.”
JER.5.1	“Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem,
JER.5.1	look around and consider,
JER.5.1	search through her squares.
JER.5.1	If you can find but one person
JER.5.1	who deals honestly and seeks the truth,
JER.5.1	I will forgive this city.
JER.5.2	Although they say, ‘As surely as the 
JER.5.2	still they are swearing falsely.”
JER.5.3	You struck them, but they felt no pain;
JER.5.3	you crushed them, but they refused correction.
JER.5.3	They made their faces harder than stone
JER.5.3	and refused to repent.
JER.5.4	I thought, “These are only the poor;
JER.5.4	they are foolish,
JER.5.4	for they do not know the way of the 
JER.5.4	the requirements of their God.
JER.5.5	So I will go to the leaders
JER.5.5	and speak to them;
JER.5.5	surely they know the way of the 
JER.5.5	the requirements of their God.”
JER.5.5	But with one accord they too had broken off the yoke
JER.5.5	and torn off the bonds.
JER.5.6	Therefore a lion from the forest will attack them,
JER.5.6	a wolf from the desert will ravage them,
JER.5.6	a leopard will lie in wait near their towns
JER.5.6	to tear to pieces any who venture out,
JER.5.6	for their rebellion is great
JER.5.6	and their backslidings many.
JER.5.7	“Why should I forgive you?
JER.5.7	Your children have forsaken me
JER.5.7	and sworn by gods that are not gods.
JER.5.7	I supplied all their needs,
JER.5.7	yet they committed adultery
JER.5.7	and thronged to the houses of prostitutes.
JER.5.8	They are well-fed, lusty stallions,
JER.5.8	each neighing for another man’s wife.
JER.5.9	Should I not punish them for this?”
JER.5.9	declares the 
JER.5.9	“Should I not avenge myself
JER.5.9	on such a nation as this?
JER.5.10	“Go through her vineyards and ravage them,
JER.5.10	but do not destroy them completely.
JER.5.10	Strip off her branches,
JER.5.10	for these people do not belong to the 
JER.5.11	The people of Israel and the people of Judah
JER.5.11	have been utterly unfaithful to me,”
JER.5.11	declares the 
JER.5.12	They have lied about the 
JER.5.12	they said, “He will do nothing!
JER.5.12	No harm will come to us;
JER.5.12	we will never see sword or famine.
JER.5.13	The prophets are but wind
JER.5.13	and the word is not in them;
JER.5.13	so let what they say be done to them.”
JER.5.14	Therefore this is what the 
JER.5.14	“Because the people have spoken these words,
JER.5.14	I will make my words in your mouth a fire
JER.5.14	and these people the wood it consumes.
JER.5.15	People of Israel,” declares the 
JER.5.15	“I am bringing a distant nation against you—
JER.5.15	an ancient and enduring nation,
JER.5.15	a people whose language you do not know,
JER.5.15	whose speech you do not understand.
JER.5.16	Their quivers are like an open grave;
JER.5.16	all of them are mighty warriors.
JER.5.17	They will devour your harvests and food,
JER.5.17	devour your sons and daughters;
JER.5.17	they will devour your flocks and herds,
JER.5.17	devour your vines and fig trees.
JER.5.17	With the sword they will destroy
JER.5.17	the fortified cities in which you trust.
JER.5.18	“Yet even in those days,” declares the 
JER.5.19	And when the people ask, ‘Why has the 
JER.5.20	“Announce this to the descendants of Jacob
JER.5.20	and proclaim it in Judah:
JER.5.21	Hear this, you foolish and senseless people,
JER.5.21	who have eyes but do not see,
JER.5.21	who have ears but do not hear:
JER.5.22	Should you not fear me?” declares the 
JER.5.22	“Should you not tremble in my presence?
JER.5.22	I made the sand a boundary for the sea,
JER.5.22	an everlasting barrier it cannot cross.
JER.5.22	The waves may roll, but they cannot prevail;
JER.5.22	they may roar, but they cannot cross it.
JER.5.23	But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts;
JER.5.23	they have turned aside and gone away.
JER.5.24	They do not say to themselves,
JER.5.24	‘Let us fear the 
JER.5.24	who gives autumn and spring rains in season,
JER.5.24	who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.’
JER.5.25	Your wrongdoings have kept these away;
JER.5.25	your sins have deprived you of good.
JER.5.26	“Among my people are the wicked
JER.5.26	who lie in wait like men who snare birds
JER.5.26	and like those who set traps to catch people.
JER.5.27	Like cages full of birds,
JER.5.27	their houses are full of deceit;
JER.5.27	they have become rich and powerful
JER.5.28	and have grown fat and sleek.
JER.5.28	Their evil deeds have no limit;
JER.5.28	they do not seek justice.
JER.5.28	They do not promote the case of the fatherless;
JER.5.28	they do not defend the just cause of the poor.
JER.5.29	Should I not punish them for this?”
JER.5.29	declares the 
JER.5.29	“Should I not avenge myself
JER.5.29	on such a nation as this?
JER.5.30	“A horrible and shocking thing
JER.5.30	has happened in the land:
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesy lies,
JER.5.31	the priests rule by their own authority,
JER.5.31	and my people love it this way.
JER.5.31	But what will you do in the end?
JER.6.1	“Flee for safety, people of Benjamin!
JER.6.1	Flee from Jerusalem!
JER.6.1	Sound the trumpet in Tekoa!
JER.6.1	Raise the signal over Beth Hakkerem!
JER.6.1	For disaster looms out of the north,
JER.6.1	even terrible destruction.
JER.6.2	I will destroy Daughter Zion,
JER.6.2	so beautiful and delicate.
JER.6.3	Shepherds with their flocks will come against her;
JER.6.3	they will pitch their tents around her,
JER.6.3	each tending his own portion.”
JER.6.4	“Prepare for battle against her!
JER.6.4	Arise, let us attack at noon!
JER.6.4	But, alas, the daylight is fading,
JER.6.4	and the shadows of evening grow long.
JER.6.5	So arise, let us attack at night
JER.6.5	and destroy her fortresses!”
JER.6.6	This is what the 
JER.6.6	“Cut down the trees
JER.6.6	and build siege ramps against Jerusalem.
JER.6.6	This city must be punished;
JER.6.6	it is filled with oppression.
JER.6.7	As a well pours out its water,
JER.6.7	so she pours out her wickedness.
JER.6.7	Violence and destruction resound in her;
JER.6.7	her sickness and wounds are ever before me.
JER.6.8	Take warning, Jerusalem,
JER.6.8	or I will turn away from you
JER.6.8	and make your land desolate
JER.6.8	so no one can live in it.”
JER.6.9	This is what the 
JER.6.9	“Let them glean the remnant of Israel
JER.6.9	as thoroughly as a vine;
JER.6.9	pass your hand over the branches again,
JER.6.9	like one gathering grapes.”
JER.6.10	To whom can I speak and give warning?
JER.6.10	Who will listen to me?
JER.6.10	Their ears are closed
JER.6.10	so they cannot hear.
JER.6.10	The word of the 
JER.6.10	they find no pleasure in it.
JER.6.11	But I am full of the wrath of the 
JER.6.11	and I cannot hold it in.
JER.6.11	“Pour it out on the children in the street
JER.6.11	and on the young men gathered together;
JER.6.11	both husband and wife will be caught in it,
JER.6.11	and the old, those weighed down with years.
JER.6.12	Their houses will be turned over to others,
JER.6.12	together with their fields and their wives,
JER.6.12	when I stretch out my hand
JER.6.12	against those who live in the land,”
JER.6.12	declares the 
JER.6.13	“From the least to the greatest,
JER.6.13	all are greedy for gain;
JER.6.13	prophets and priests alike,
JER.6.13	all practice deceit.
JER.6.14	They dress the wound of my people
JER.6.14	as though it were not serious.
JER.6.14	‘Peace, peace,’ they say,
JER.6.14	when there is no peace.
JER.6.15	Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct?
JER.6.15	No, they have no shame at all;
JER.6.15	they do not even know how to blush.
JER.6.15	So they will fall among the fallen;
JER.6.15	they will be brought down when I punish them,”
JER.6.15	says the 
JER.6.16	This is what the 
JER.6.16	“Stand at the crossroads and look;
JER.6.16	ask for the ancient paths,
JER.6.16	ask where the good way is, and walk in it,
JER.6.16	and you will find rest for your souls.
JER.6.16	But you said, ‘We will not walk in it.’
JER.6.17	I appointed watchmen over you and said,
JER.6.17	‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’
JER.6.17	But you said, ‘We will not listen.’
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, you nations;
JER.6.18	you who are witnesses,
JER.6.18	observe what will happen to them.
JER.6.19	Hear, you earth:
JER.6.19	I am bringing disaster on this people,
JER.6.19	the fruit of their schemes,
JER.6.19	because they have not listened to my words
JER.6.19	and have rejected my law.
JER.6.20	What do I care about incense from Sheba
JER.6.20	or sweet calamus from a distant land?
JER.6.20	Your burnt offerings are not acceptable;
JER.6.20	your sacrifices do not please me.”
JER.6.21	Therefore this is what the 
JER.6.21	“I will put obstacles before this people.
JER.6.21	Parents and children alike will stumble over them;
JER.6.21	neighbors and friends will perish.”
JER.6.22	This is what the 
JER.6.22	“Look, an army is coming
JER.6.22	from the land of the north;
JER.6.22	a great nation is being stirred up
JER.6.22	from the ends of the earth.
JER.6.23	They are armed with bow and spear;
JER.6.23	they are cruel and show no mercy.
JER.6.23	They sound like the roaring sea
JER.6.23	as they ride on their horses;
JER.6.23	they come like men in battle formation
JER.6.23	to attack you, Daughter Zion.”
JER.6.24	We have heard reports about them,
JER.6.24	and our hands hang limp.
JER.6.24	Anguish has gripped us,
JER.6.24	pain like that of a woman in labor.
JER.6.25	Do not go out to the fields
JER.6.25	or walk on the roads,
JER.6.25	for the enemy has a sword,
JER.6.25	and there is terror on every side.
JER.6.26	Put on sackcloth, my people,
JER.6.26	and roll in ashes;
JER.6.26	mourn with bitter wailing
JER.6.26	as for an only son,
JER.6.26	for suddenly the destroyer
JER.6.26	will come upon us.
JER.6.27	“I have made you a tester of metals
JER.6.27	and my people the ore,
JER.6.27	that you may observe
JER.6.27	and test their ways.
JER.6.28	They are all hardened rebels,
JER.6.28	going about to slander.
JER.6.28	They are bronze and iron;
JER.6.28	they all act corruptly.
JER.6.29	The bellows blow fiercely
JER.6.29	to burn away the lead with fire,
JER.6.29	but the refining goes on in vain;
JER.6.29	the wicked are not purged out.
JER.6.30	They are called rejected silver,
JER.6.30	because the 
JER.7.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.7.2	“Stand at the gate of the 
JER.7.2	“ ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.7.3	This is what the 
JER.7.4	Do not trust in deceptive words and say, “This is the temple of the 
JER.7.5	If you really change your ways and your actions and deal with each other justly, 
JER.7.6	if you do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm, 
JER.7.7	then I will let you live in this place, in the land I gave your ancestors for ever and ever. 
JER.7.8	But look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless.
JER.7.9	“ ‘Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury,
JER.7.10	and then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my Name, and say, “We are safe”—safe to do all these detestable things? 
JER.7.11	Has this house, which bears my Name, become a den of robbers to you? But I have been watching! declares the 
JER.7.12	“ ‘Go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for my Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel. 
JER.7.13	While you were doing all these things, declares the 
JER.7.14	Therefore, what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears my Name, the temple you trust in, the place I gave to you and your ancestors. 
JER.7.15	I will thrust you from my presence, just as I did all your fellow Israelites, the people of Ephraim.’
JER.7.16	“So do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them; do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you. 
JER.7.17	Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to arouse my anger. 
JER.7.19	But am I the one they are provoking? declares the 
JER.7.20	“ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign 
JER.7.21	“ ‘This is what the 
JER.7.22	For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, 
JER.7.23	but I gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Walk in obedience to all I command you, that it may go well with you. 
JER.7.24	But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. They went backward and not forward. 
JER.7.25	From the time your ancestors left Egypt until now, day after day, again and again I sent you my servants the prophets. 
JER.7.26	But they did not listen to me or pay attention. They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their ancestors.’
JER.7.27	“When you tell them all this, they will not listen to you; when you call to them, they will not answer. 
JER.7.28	Therefore say to them, ‘This is the nation that has not obeyed the 
JER.7.29	“ ‘Cut off your hair and throw it away; take up a lament on the barren heights, for the 
JER.7.30	“ ‘The people of Judah have done evil in my eyes, declares the 
JER.7.31	They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I did not command, nor did it enter my mind. 
JER.7.32	So beware, the days are coming, declares the 
JER.7.33	Then the carcasses of this people will become food for the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away. 
JER.7.34	I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the land will become desolate.
JER.8.1	“ ‘At that time, declares the 
JER.8.2	They will be exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens, which they have loved and served and which they have followed and consulted and worshiped. They will not be gathered up or buried, but will be like dung lying on the ground. 
JER.8.3	Wherever I banish them, all the survivors of this evil nation will prefer death to life, declares the 
JER.8.4	“Say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.8.4	“ ‘When people fall down, do they not get up?
JER.8.4	When someone turns away, do they not return?
JER.8.5	Why then have these people turned away?
JER.8.5	Why does Jerusalem always turn away?
JER.8.5	They cling to deceit;
JER.8.5	they refuse to return.
JER.8.6	I have listened attentively,
JER.8.6	but they do not say what is right.
JER.8.6	None of them repent of their wickedness,
JER.8.6	saying, “What have I done?”
JER.8.6	Each pursues their own course
JER.8.6	like a horse charging into battle.
JER.8.7	Even the stork in the sky
JER.8.7	knows her appointed seasons,
JER.8.7	and the dove, the swift and the thrush
JER.8.7	observe the time of their migration.
JER.8.7	But my people do not know
JER.8.7	the requirements of the 
JER.8.8	“ ‘How can you say, “We are wise,
JER.8.8	for we have the law of the 
JER.8.8	when actually the lying pen of the scribes
JER.8.8	has handled it falsely?
JER.8.9	The wise will be put to shame;
JER.8.9	they will be dismayed and trapped.
JER.8.9	Since they have rejected the word of the 
JER.8.9	what kind of wisdom do they have?
JER.8.10	Therefore I will give their wives to other men
JER.8.10	and their fields to new owners.
JER.8.10	From the least to the greatest,
JER.8.10	all are greedy for gain;
JER.8.10	prophets and priests alike,
JER.8.10	all practice deceit.
JER.8.11	They dress the wound of my people
JER.8.11	as though it were not serious.
JER.8.11	“Peace, peace,” they say,
JER.8.11	when there is no peace.
JER.8.12	Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct?
JER.8.12	No, they have no shame at all;
JER.8.12	they do not even know how to blush.
JER.8.12	So they will fall among the fallen;
JER.8.12	they will be brought down when they are punished,
JER.8.12	says the 
JER.8.13	“ ‘I will take away their harvest,
JER.8.13	declares the 
JER.8.13	There will be no grapes on the vine.
JER.8.13	There will be no figs on the tree,
JER.8.13	and their leaves will wither.
JER.8.13	What I have given them
JER.8.13	will be taken from them.
JER.8.14	Why are we sitting here?
JER.8.14	Gather together!
JER.8.14	Let us flee to the fortified cities
JER.8.14	and perish there!
JER.8.14	For the 
JER.8.14	and given us poisoned water to drink,
JER.8.14	because we have sinned against him.
JER.8.15	We hoped for peace
JER.8.15	but no good has come,
JER.8.15	for a time of healing
JER.8.15	but there is only terror.
JER.8.16	The snorting of the enemy’s horses
JER.8.16	is heard from Dan;
JER.8.16	at the neighing of their stallions
JER.8.16	the whole land trembles.
JER.8.16	They have come to devour
JER.8.16	the land and everything in it,
JER.8.16	the city and all who live there.
JER.8.17	“See, I will send venomous snakes among you,
JER.8.17	vipers that cannot be charmed,
JER.8.17	and they will bite you,”
JER.8.17	declares the 
JER.8.18	You who are my Comforter
JER.8.18	my heart is faint within me.
JER.8.19	Listen to the cry of my people
JER.8.19	from a land far away:
JER.8.19	“Is the 
JER.8.19	Is her King no longer there?”
JER.8.19	“Why have they aroused my anger with their images,
JER.8.19	with their worthless foreign idols?”
JER.8.20	“The harvest is past,
JER.8.20	the summer has ended,
JER.8.20	and we are not saved.”
JER.8.21	Since my people are crushed, I am crushed;
JER.8.21	I mourn, and horror grips me.
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in Gilead?
JER.8.22	Is there no physician there?
JER.8.22	Why then is there no healing
JER.8.22	for the wound of my people?
JER.9.1	Oh, that my head were a spring of water
JER.9.1	and my eyes a fountain of tears!
JER.9.1	I would weep day and night
JER.9.1	for the slain of my people.
JER.9.2	Oh, that I had in the desert
JER.9.2	a lodging place for travelers,
JER.9.2	so that I might leave my people
JER.9.2	and go away from them;
JER.9.2	for they are all adulterers,
JER.9.2	a crowd of unfaithful people.
JER.9.3	“They make ready their tongue
JER.9.3	like a bow, to shoot lies;
JER.9.3	it is not by truth
JER.9.3	that they triumph
JER.9.3	They go from one sin to another;
JER.9.3	they do not acknowledge me,”
JER.9.3	declares the 
JER.9.4	“Beware of your friends;
JER.9.4	do not trust anyone in your clan.
JER.9.4	For every one of them is a deceiver,
JER.9.4	and every friend a slanderer.
JER.9.5	Friend deceives friend,
JER.9.5	and no one speaks the truth.
JER.9.5	They have taught their tongues to lie;
JER.9.5	they weary themselves with sinning.
JER.9.6	You
JER.9.6	in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me,”
JER.9.6	declares the 
JER.9.7	Therefore this is what the 
JER.9.7	“See, I will refine and test them,
JER.9.7	for what else can I do
JER.9.7	because of the sin of my people?
JER.9.8	Their tongue is a deadly arrow;
JER.9.8	it speaks deceitfully.
JER.9.8	With their mouths they all speak cordially to their neighbors,
JER.9.8	but in their hearts they set traps for them.
JER.9.9	Should I not punish them for this?”
JER.9.9	declares the 
JER.9.9	“Should I not avenge myself
JER.9.9	on such a nation as this?”
JER.9.10	I will weep and wail for the mountains
JER.9.10	and take up a lament concerning the wilderness grasslands.
JER.9.10	They are desolate and untraveled,
JER.9.10	and the lowing of cattle is not heard.
JER.9.10	The birds have all fled
JER.9.10	and the animals are gone.
JER.9.11	“I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins,
JER.9.11	a haunt of jackals;
JER.9.11	and I will lay waste the towns of Judah
JER.9.11	so no one can live there.”
JER.9.12	Who is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the 
JER.9.13	The 
JER.9.14	Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts; they have followed the Baals, as their ancestors taught them.” 
JER.9.15	Therefore this is what the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them.”
JER.9.17	This is what the 
JER.9.17	“Consider now! Call for the wailing women to come;
JER.9.17	send for the most skillful of them.
JER.9.18	Let them come quickly
JER.9.18	and wail over us
JER.9.18	till our eyes overflow with tears
JER.9.18	and water streams from our eyelids.
JER.9.19	The sound of wailing is heard from Zion:
JER.9.19	‘How ruined we are!
JER.9.19	How great is our shame!
JER.9.19	We must leave our land
JER.9.19	because our houses are in ruins.’ ”
JER.9.20	Now, you women, hear the word of the 
JER.9.20	open your ears to the words of his mouth.
JER.9.20	Teach your daughters how to wail;
JER.9.20	teach one another a lament.
JER.9.21	Death has climbed in through our windows
JER.9.21	and has entered our fortresses;
JER.9.21	it has removed the children from the streets
JER.9.21	and the young men from the public squares.
JER.9.22	Say, “This is what the 
JER.9.22	“ ‘Dead bodies will lie
JER.9.22	like dung on the open field,
JER.9.22	like cut grain behind the reaper,
JER.9.22	with no one to gather them.’ ”
JER.9.23	This is what the 
JER.9.23	“Let not the wise boast of their wisdom
JER.9.23	or the strong boast of their strength
JER.9.23	or the rich boast of their riches,
JER.9.24	but let the one who boasts boast about this:
JER.9.24	that they have the understanding to know me,
JER.9.24	that I am the 
JER.9.24	justice and righteousness on earth,
JER.9.24	for in these I delight,”
JER.9.24	declares the 
JER.9.25	“The days are coming,” declares the 
JER.9.26	Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places.
JER.10.1	Hear what the 
JER.10.2	This is what the 
JER.10.2	“Do not learn the ways of the nations
JER.10.2	or be terrified by signs in the heavens,
JER.10.2	though the nations are terrified by them.
JER.10.3	For the practices of the peoples are worthless;
JER.10.3	they cut a tree out of the forest,
JER.10.3	and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel.
JER.10.4	They adorn it with silver and gold;
JER.10.4	they fasten it with hammer and nails
JER.10.4	so it will not totter.
JER.10.5	Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field,
JER.10.5	their idols cannot speak;
JER.10.5	they must be carried
JER.10.5	because they cannot walk.
JER.10.5	Do not fear them;
JER.10.5	they can do no harm
JER.10.5	nor can they do any good.”
JER.10.6	No one is like you, 
JER.10.6	you are great,
JER.10.6	and your name is mighty in power.
JER.10.7	Who should not fear you,
JER.10.7	King of the nations?
JER.10.7	This is your due.
JER.10.7	Among all the wise leaders of the nations
JER.10.7	and in all their kingdoms,
JER.10.7	there is no one like you.
JER.10.8	They are all senseless and foolish;
JER.10.8	they are taught by worthless wooden idols.
JER.10.9	Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish
JER.10.9	and gold from Uphaz.
JER.10.9	What the craftsman and goldsmith have made
JER.10.9	is then dressed in blue and purple—
JER.10.9	all made by skilled workers.
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.10	he is the living God, the eternal King.
JER.10.10	When he is angry, the earth trembles;
JER.10.10	the nations cannot endure his wrath.
JER.10.11	“Tell them this: ‘These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.’ ”
JER.10.12	But God made the earth by his power;
JER.10.12	he founded the world by his wisdom
JER.10.12	and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
JER.10.13	When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar;
JER.10.13	he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth.
JER.10.13	He sends lightning with the rain
JER.10.13	and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
JER.10.14	Everyone is senseless and without knowledge;
JER.10.14	every goldsmith is shamed by his idols.
JER.10.14	The images he makes are a fraud;
JER.10.14	they have no breath in them.
JER.10.15	They are worthless, the objects of mockery;
JER.10.15	when their judgment comes, they will perish.
JER.10.16	He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these,
JER.10.16	for he is the Maker of all things,
JER.10.16	including Israel, the people of his inheritance—
JER.10.16	the 
JER.10.17	Gather up your belongings to leave the land,
JER.10.17	you who live under siege.
JER.10.18	For this is what the 
JER.10.18	“At this time I will hurl out
JER.10.18	those who live in this land;
JER.10.18	I will bring distress on them
JER.10.18	so that they may be captured.”
JER.10.19	Woe to me because of my injury!
JER.10.19	My wound is incurable!
JER.10.19	Yet I said to myself,
JER.10.19	“This is my sickness, and I must endure it.”
JER.10.20	My tent is destroyed;
JER.10.20	all its ropes are snapped.
JER.10.20	My children are gone from me and are no more;
JER.10.20	no one is left now to pitch my tent
JER.10.20	or to set up my shelter.
JER.10.21	The shepherds are senseless
JER.10.21	and do not inquire of the 
JER.10.21	so they do not prosper
JER.10.21	and all their flock is scattered.
JER.10.22	Listen! The report is coming—
JER.10.22	a great commotion from the land of the north!
JER.10.22	It will make the towns of Judah desolate,
JER.10.22	a haunt of jackals.
JER.10.23	it is not for them to direct their steps.
JER.10.24	Discipline me, 
JER.10.24	not in your anger,
JER.10.24	or you will reduce me to nothing.
JER.10.25	Pour out your wrath on the nations
JER.10.25	that do not acknowledge you,
JER.10.25	on the peoples who do not call on your name.
JER.10.25	For they have devoured Jacob;
JER.10.25	they have devoured him completely
JER.10.25	and destroyed his homeland.
JER.11.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.11.2	“Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem. 
JER.11.3	Tell them that this is what the 
JER.11.4	the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.’ I said, ‘Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God. 
JER.11.5	Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey’—the land you possess today.”
JER.11.5	I answered, “Amen, 
JER.11.6	The 
JER.11.7	From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, “Obey me.” 
JER.11.8	But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.’ ”
JER.11.9	Then the 
JER.11.10	They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. 
JER.11.11	Therefore this is what the 
JER.11.12	The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes. 
JER.11.13	You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.’
JER.11.14	“Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress.
JER.11.15	“What is my beloved doing in my temple
JER.11.15	as she, with many others, works out her evil schemes?
JER.11.15	Can consecrated meat avert your punishment?
JER.11.15	When you engage in your wickedness,
JER.11.15	then you rejoice.
JER.11.16	The 
JER.11.16	with fruit beautiful in form.
JER.11.16	But with the roar of a mighty storm
JER.11.16	he will set it on fire,
JER.11.16	and its branches will be broken.
JER.11.17	The 
JER.11.18	Because the 
JER.11.19	I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying,
JER.11.19	“Let us destroy the tree and its fruit;
JER.11.19	let us cut him off from the land of the living,
JER.11.19	that his name be remembered no more.”
JER.11.20	But you, 
JER.11.20	and test the heart and mind,
JER.11.20	let me see your vengeance on them,
JER.11.20	for to you I have committed my cause.
JER.11.21	Therefore this is what the 
JER.11.22	therefore this is what the 
JER.11.23	Not even a remnant will be left to them, because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”
JER.12.1	You are always righteous, 
JER.12.1	when I bring a case before you.
JER.12.1	Yet I would speak with you about your justice:
JER.12.1	Why does the way of the wicked prosper?
JER.12.1	Why do all the faithless live at ease?
JER.12.2	You have planted them, and they have taken root;
JER.12.2	they grow and bear fruit.
JER.12.2	You are always on their lips
JER.12.2	but far from their hearts.
JER.12.3	Yet you know me, 
JER.12.3	you see me and test my thoughts about you.
JER.12.3	Drag them off like sheep to be butchered!
JER.12.3	Set them apart for the day of slaughter!
JER.12.4	How long will the land lie parched
JER.12.4	and the grass in every field be withered?
JER.12.4	Because those who live in it are wicked,
JER.12.4	the animals and birds have perished.
JER.12.4	Moreover, the people are saying,
JER.12.4	“He will not see what happens to us.”
JER.12.5	“If you have raced with men on foot
JER.12.5	and they have worn you out,
JER.12.5	how can you compete with horses?
JER.12.5	If you stumble
JER.12.5	how will you manage in the thickets by
JER.12.6	Your relatives, members of your own family—
JER.12.6	even they have betrayed you;
JER.12.6	they have raised a loud cry against you.
JER.12.6	Do not trust them,
JER.12.6	though they speak well of you.
JER.12.7	“I will forsake my house,
JER.12.7	abandon my inheritance;
JER.12.7	I will give the one I love
JER.12.7	into the hands of her enemies.
JER.12.8	My inheritance has become to me
JER.12.8	like a lion in the forest.
JER.12.8	She roars at me;
JER.12.8	therefore I hate her.
JER.12.9	Has not my inheritance become to me
JER.12.9	like a speckled bird of prey
JER.12.9	that other birds of prey surround and attack?
JER.12.9	Go and gather all the wild beasts;
JER.12.9	bring them to devour.
JER.12.10	Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard
JER.12.10	and trample down my field;
JER.12.10	they will turn my pleasant field
JER.12.10	into a desolate wasteland.
JER.12.11	It will be made a wasteland,
JER.12.11	parched and desolate before me;
JER.12.11	the whole land will be laid waste
JER.12.11	because there is no one who cares.
JER.12.12	Over all the barren heights in the desert
JER.12.12	destroyers will swarm,
JER.12.12	for the sword of the 
JER.12.12	from one end of the land to the other;
JER.12.12	no one will be safe.
JER.12.13	They will sow wheat but reap thorns;
JER.12.13	they will wear themselves out but gain nothing.
JER.12.13	They will bear the shame of their harvest
JER.12.13	because of the 
JER.12.14	This is what the 
JER.12.15	But after I uproot them, I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance and their own country. 
JER.12.16	And if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name, saying, ‘As surely as the 
JER.12.17	But if any nation does not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy it,” declares the 
JER.13.1	This is what the 
JER.13.2	So I bought a belt, as the 
JER.13.3	Then the word of the 
JER.13.4	“Take the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist, and go now to Perath
JER.13.5	So I went and hid it at Perath, as the 
JER.13.6	Many days later the 
JER.13.7	So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it, but now it was ruined and completely useless.
JER.13.8	Then the word of the 
JER.13.9	“This is what the 
JER.13.10	These wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt—completely useless! 
JER.13.11	For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me,’ declares the 
JER.13.12	“Say to them: ‘This is what the 
JER.13.13	then tell them, ‘This is what the 
JER.13.14	I will smash them one against the other, parents and children alike, declares the 
JER.13.15	Hear and pay attention,
JER.13.15	do not be arrogant,
JER.13.15	for the 
JER.13.16	Give glory to the 
JER.13.16	before he brings the darkness,
JER.13.16	before your feet stumble
JER.13.16	on the darkening hills.
JER.13.16	You hope for light,
JER.13.16	but he will turn it to utter darkness
JER.13.16	and change it to deep gloom.
JER.13.17	If you do not listen,
JER.13.17	I will weep in secret
JER.13.17	because of your pride;
JER.13.17	my eyes will weep bitterly,
JER.13.17	overflowing with tears,
JER.13.17	because the 
JER.13.18	Say to the king and to the queen mother,
JER.13.18	“Come down from your thrones,
JER.13.18	for your glorious crowns
JER.13.18	will fall from your heads.”
JER.13.19	The cities in the Negev will be shut up,
JER.13.19	and there will be no one to open them.
JER.13.19	All Judah will be carried into exile,
JER.13.19	carried completely away.
JER.13.20	Look up and see
JER.13.20	those who are coming from the north.
JER.13.20	Where is the flock that was entrusted to you,
JER.13.20	the sheep of which you boasted?
JER.13.21	What will you say when the 
JER.13.21	those you cultivated as your special allies?
JER.13.21	Will not pain grip you
JER.13.21	like that of a woman in labor?
JER.13.22	And if you ask yourself,
JER.13.22	“Why has this happened to me?”—
JER.13.22	it is because of your many sins
JER.13.22	that your skirts have been torn off
JER.13.22	and your body mistreated.
JER.13.23	Can an Ethiopian
JER.13.23	or a leopard its spots?
JER.13.23	Neither can you do good
JER.13.23	who are accustomed to doing evil.
JER.13.24	“I will scatter you like chaff
JER.13.24	driven by the desert wind.
JER.13.25	This is your lot,
JER.13.25	the portion I have decreed for you,”
JER.13.25	declares the 
JER.13.25	“because you have forgotten me
JER.13.25	and trusted in false gods.
JER.13.26	I will pull up your skirts over your face
JER.13.26	that your shame may be seen—
JER.13.27	your adulteries and lustful neighings,
JER.13.27	your shameless prostitution!
JER.13.27	I have seen your detestable acts
JER.13.27	on the hills and in the fields.
JER.13.27	Woe to you, Jerusalem!
JER.13.27	How long will you be unclean?”
JER.14.1	This is the word of the 
JER.14.2	“Judah mourns,
JER.14.2	her cities languish;
JER.14.2	they wail for the land,
JER.14.2	and a cry goes up from Jerusalem.
JER.14.3	The nobles send their servants for water;
JER.14.3	they go to the cisterns
JER.14.3	but find no water.
JER.14.3	They return with their jars unfilled;
JER.14.3	dismayed and despairing,
JER.14.3	they cover their heads.
JER.14.4	The ground is cracked
JER.14.4	because there is no rain in the land;
JER.14.4	the farmers are dismayed
JER.14.4	and cover their heads.
JER.14.5	Even the doe in the field
JER.14.5	deserts her newborn fawn
JER.14.5	because there is no grass.
JER.14.6	Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights
JER.14.6	and pant like jackals;
JER.14.6	their eyes fail
JER.14.6	for lack of food.”
JER.14.7	Although our sins testify against us,
JER.14.7	do something, 
JER.14.7	For we have often rebelled;
JER.14.7	we have sinned against you.
JER.14.8	You who are the hope of Israel,
JER.14.8	its Savior in times of distress,
JER.14.8	why are you like a stranger in the land,
JER.14.8	like a traveler who stays only a night?
JER.14.9	Why are you like a man taken by surprise,
JER.14.9	like a warrior powerless to save?
JER.14.9	You are among us, 
JER.14.9	and we bear your name;
JER.14.9	do not forsake us!
JER.14.10	This is what the 
JER.14.10	“They greatly love to wander;
JER.14.10	they do not restrain their feet.
JER.14.10	So the 
JER.14.10	he will now remember their wickedness
JER.14.10	and punish them for their sins.”
JER.14.11	Then the 
JER.14.12	Although they fast, I will not listen to their cry; though they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will destroy them with the sword, famine and plague.”
JER.14.13	But I said, “Alas, Sovereign 
JER.14.14	Then the 
JER.14.15	Therefore this is what the 
JER.14.16	And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and sword. There will be no one to bury them, their wives, their sons and their daughters. I will pour out on them the calamity they deserve.
JER.14.17	“Speak this word to them:
JER.14.17	“ ‘Let my eyes overflow with tears
JER.14.17	night and day without ceasing;
JER.14.17	for the Virgin Daughter, my people,
JER.14.17	has suffered a grievous wound,
JER.14.17	a crushing blow.
JER.14.18	If I go into the country,
JER.14.18	I see those slain by the sword;
JER.14.18	if I go into the city,
JER.14.18	I see the ravages of famine.
JER.14.18	Both prophet and priest
JER.14.18	have gone to a land they know not.’ ”
JER.14.19	Have you rejected Judah completely?
JER.14.19	Do you despise Zion?
JER.14.19	Why have you afflicted us
JER.14.19	so that we cannot be healed?
JER.14.19	We hoped for peace
JER.14.19	but no good has come,
JER.14.19	for a time of healing
JER.14.19	but there is only terror.
JER.14.20	We acknowledge our wickedness, 
JER.14.20	and the guilt of our ancestors;
JER.14.20	we have indeed sinned against you.
JER.14.21	For the sake of your name do not despise us;
JER.14.21	do not dishonor your glorious throne.
JER.14.21	Remember your covenant with us
JER.14.21	and do not break it.
JER.14.22	Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain?
JER.14.22	Do the skies themselves send down showers?
JER.14.22	No, it is you, 
JER.14.22	Therefore our hope is in you,
JER.14.22	for you are the one who does all this.
JER.15.1	Then the 
JER.15.2	And if they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’ tell them, ‘This is what the 
JER.15.2	“ ‘Those destined for death, to death;
JER.15.2	those for the sword, to the sword;
JER.15.2	those for starvation, to starvation;
JER.15.2	those for captivity, to captivity.’
JER.15.3	“I will send four kinds of destroyers against them,” declares the 
JER.15.4	I will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem.
JER.15.5	“Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem?
JER.15.5	Who will mourn for you?
JER.15.5	Who will stop to ask how you are?
JER.15.6	You have rejected me,” declares the 
JER.15.6	“You keep on backsliding.
JER.15.6	So I will reach out and destroy you;
JER.15.6	I am tired of holding back.
JER.15.7	I will winnow them with a winnowing fork
JER.15.7	at the city gates of the land.
JER.15.7	I will bring bereavement and destruction on my people,
JER.15.7	for they have not changed their ways.
JER.15.8	I will make their widows more numerous
JER.15.8	than the sand of the sea.
JER.15.8	At midday I will bring a destroyer
JER.15.8	against the mothers of their young men;
JER.15.8	suddenly I will bring down on them
JER.15.8	anguish and terror.
JER.15.9	The mother of seven will grow faint
JER.15.9	and breathe her last.
JER.15.9	Her sun will set while it is still day;
JER.15.9	she will be disgraced and humiliated.
JER.15.9	I will put the survivors to the sword
JER.15.9	before their enemies,”
JER.15.9	declares the 
JER.15.10	Alas, my mother, that you gave me birth,
JER.15.10	a man with whom the whole land strives and contends!
JER.15.10	I have neither lent nor borrowed,
JER.15.10	yet everyone curses me.
JER.15.11	The 
JER.15.11	“Surely I will deliver you for a good purpose;
JER.15.11	surely I will make your enemies plead with you
JER.15.11	in times of disaster and times of distress.
JER.15.12	“Can a man break iron—
JER.15.12	iron from the north—or bronze?
JER.15.13	“Your wealth and your treasures
JER.15.13	I will give as plunder, without charge,
JER.15.13	because of all your sins
JER.15.13	throughout your country.
JER.15.14	I will enslave you to your enemies
JER.15.14	in
JER.15.14	for my anger will kindle a fire
JER.15.14	that will burn against you.”
JER.15.15	remember me and care for me.
JER.15.15	Avenge me on my persecutors.
JER.15.15	You are long-suffering—do not take me away;
JER.15.15	think of how I suffer reproach for your sake.
JER.15.16	When your words came, I ate them;
JER.15.16	they were my joy and my heart’s delight,
JER.15.16	for I bear your name,
JER.15.17	I never sat in the company of revelers,
JER.15.17	never made merry with them;
JER.15.17	I sat alone because your hand was on me
JER.15.17	and you had filled me with indignation.
JER.15.18	Why is my pain unending
JER.15.18	and my wound grievous and incurable?
JER.15.18	You are to me like a deceptive brook,
JER.15.18	like a spring that fails.
JER.15.19	Therefore this is what the 
JER.15.19	“If you repent, I will restore you
JER.15.19	that you may serve me;
JER.15.19	if you utter worthy, not worthless, words,
JER.15.19	you will be my spokesman.
JER.15.19	Let this people turn to you,
JER.15.19	but you must not turn to them.
JER.15.20	I will make you a wall to this people,
JER.15.20	a fortified wall of bronze;
JER.15.20	they will fight against you
JER.15.20	but will not overcome you,
JER.15.20	for I am with you
JER.15.20	to rescue and save you,”
JER.15.20	declares the 
JER.15.21	“I will save you from the hands of the wicked
JER.15.21	and deliver you from the grasp of the cruel.”
JER.16.1	Then the word of the 
JER.16.2	“You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place.” 
JER.16.3	For this is what the 
JER.16.4	“They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.”
JER.16.5	For this is what the 
JER.16.6	“Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead. 
JER.16.7	No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even for a father or a mother—nor will anyone give them a drink to console them.
JER.16.8	“And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink. 
JER.16.9	For this is what the 
JER.16.10	“When you tell these people all this and they ask you, ‘Why has the 
JER.16.11	then say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors forsook me,’ declares the 
JER.16.12	But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors. See how all of you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me. 
JER.16.13	So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’
JER.16.14	“However, the days are coming,” declares the 
JER.16.15	but it will be said, ‘As surely as the 
JER.16.16	“But now I will send for many fishermen,” declares the 
JER.16.17	My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes. 
JER.16.18	I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.”
JER.16.19	my refuge in time of distress,
JER.16.19	to you the nations will come
JER.16.19	from the ends of the earth and say,
JER.16.19	“Our ancestors possessed nothing but false gods,
JER.16.19	worthless idols that did them no good.
JER.16.20	Do people make their own gods?
JER.16.20	Yes, but they are not gods!”
JER.16.21	“Therefore I will teach them—
JER.16.21	this time I will teach them
JER.16.21	my power and might.
JER.16.21	Then they will know
JER.16.21	that my name is the 
JER.17.1	“Judah’s sin is engraved with an iron tool,
JER.17.1	inscribed with a flint point,
JER.17.1	on the tablets of their hearts
JER.17.1	and on the horns of their altars.
JER.17.2	Even their children remember
JER.17.2	their altars and Asherah poles
JER.17.2	beside the spreading trees
JER.17.2	and on the high hills.
JER.17.3	My mountain in the land
JER.17.3	and your
JER.17.3	I will give away as plunder,
JER.17.3	together with your high places,
JER.17.3	because of sin throughout your country.
JER.17.4	Through your own fault you will lose
JER.17.4	the inheritance I gave you.
JER.17.4	I will enslave you to your enemies
JER.17.4	in a land you do not know,
JER.17.4	for you have kindled my anger,
JER.17.4	and it will burn forever.”
JER.17.5	This is what the 
JER.17.5	“Cursed is the one who trusts in man,
JER.17.5	who draws strength from mere flesh
JER.17.5	and whose heart turns away from the 
JER.17.6	That person will be like a bush in the wastelands;
JER.17.6	they will not see prosperity when it comes.
JER.17.6	They will dwell in the parched places of the desert,
JER.17.6	in a salt land where no one lives.
JER.17.7	“But blessed is the one who trusts in the 
JER.17.7	whose confidence is in him.
JER.17.8	They will be like a tree planted by the water
JER.17.8	that sends out its roots by the stream.
JER.17.8	It does not fear when heat comes;
JER.17.8	its leaves are always green.
JER.17.8	It has no worries in a year of drought
JER.17.8	and never fails to bear fruit.”
JER.17.9	The heart is deceitful above all things
JER.17.9	and beyond cure.
JER.17.9	Who can understand it?
JER.17.10	“I the 
JER.17.10	and examine the mind,
JER.17.10	to reward each person according to their conduct,
JER.17.10	according to what their deeds deserve.”
JER.17.11	Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay
JER.17.11	are those who gain riches by unjust means.
JER.17.11	When their lives are half gone, their riches will desert them,
JER.17.11	and in the end they will prove to be fools.
JER.17.12	A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning,
JER.17.12	is the place of our sanctuary.
JER.17.13	all who forsake you will be put to shame.
JER.17.13	Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust
JER.17.13	because they have forsaken the 
JER.17.13	the spring of living water.
JER.17.14	Heal me, 
JER.17.14	save me and I will be saved,
JER.17.14	for you are the one I praise.
JER.17.15	They keep saying to me,
JER.17.15	“Where is the word of the 
JER.17.15	Let it now be fulfilled!”
JER.17.16	I have not run away from being your shepherd;
JER.17.16	you know I have not desired the day of despair.
JER.17.16	What passes my lips is open before you.
JER.17.17	Do not be a terror to me;
JER.17.17	you are my refuge in the day of disaster.
JER.17.18	Let my persecutors be put to shame,
JER.17.18	but keep me from shame;
JER.17.18	let them be terrified,
JER.17.18	but keep me from terror.
JER.17.18	Bring on them the day of disaster;
JER.17.18	destroy them with double destruction.
JER.17.19	This is what the 
JER.17.20	Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.17.21	This is what the 
JER.17.22	Do not bring a load out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your ancestors. 
JER.17.23	Yet they did not listen or pay attention; they were stiff-necked and would not listen or respond to discipline. 
JER.17.24	But if you are careful to obey me, declares the 
JER.17.25	then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this city with their officials. They and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by the men of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever. 
JER.17.26	People will come from the towns of Judah and the villages around Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin and the western foothills, from the hill country and the Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the 
JER.17.27	But if you do not obey me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in the gates of Jerusalem that will consume her fortresses.’ ”
JER.18.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.18.2	“Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.” 
JER.18.3	So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel. 
JER.18.4	But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.
JER.18.5	Then the word of the 
JER.18.6	He said, “Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?” declares the 
JER.18.7	If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, 
JER.18.8	and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. 
JER.18.9	And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, 
JER.18.10	and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.
JER.18.11	“Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘This is what the 
JER.18.12	But they will reply, ‘It’s no use. We will continue with our own plans; we will all follow the stubbornness of our evil hearts.’ ”
JER.18.13	Therefore this is what the 
JER.18.13	“Inquire among the nations:
JER.18.13	Who has ever heard anything like this?
JER.18.13	A most horrible thing has been done
JER.18.13	by Virgin Israel.
JER.18.14	Does the snow of Lebanon
JER.18.14	ever vanish from its rocky slopes?
JER.18.14	Do its cool waters from distant sources
JER.18.14	ever stop flowing?
JER.18.15	Yet my people have forgotten me;
JER.18.15	they burn incense to worthless idols,
JER.18.15	which made them stumble in their ways,
JER.18.15	in the ancient paths.
JER.18.15	They made them walk in byways,
JER.18.15	on roads not built up.
JER.18.16	Their land will be an object of horror
JER.18.16	and of lasting scorn;
JER.18.16	all who pass by will be appalled
JER.18.16	and will shake their heads.
JER.18.17	Like a wind from the east,
JER.18.17	I will scatter them before their enemies;
JER.18.17	I will show them my back and not my face
JER.18.17	in the day of their disaster.”
JER.18.18	They said, “Come, let’s make plans against Jeremiah; for the teaching of the law by the priest will not cease, nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophets. So come, let’s attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says.”
JER.18.19	Listen to me, 
JER.18.19	hear what my accusers are saying!
JER.18.20	Should good be repaid with evil?
JER.18.20	Yet they have dug a pit for me.
JER.18.20	Remember that I stood before you
JER.18.20	and spoke in their behalf
JER.18.20	to turn your wrath away from them.
JER.18.21	So give their children over to famine;
JER.18.21	hand them over to the power of the sword.
JER.18.21	Let their wives be made childless and widows;
JER.18.21	let their men be put to death,
JER.18.21	their young men slain by the sword in battle.
JER.18.22	Let a cry be heard from their houses
JER.18.22	when you suddenly bring invaders against them,
JER.18.22	for they have dug a pit to capture me
JER.18.22	and have hidden snares for my feet.
JER.18.23	But you, 
JER.18.23	all their plots to kill me.
JER.18.23	Do not forgive their crimes
JER.18.23	or blot out their sins from your sight.
JER.18.23	Let them be overthrown before you;
JER.18.23	deal with them in the time of your anger.
JER.19.1	This is what the 
JER.19.2	and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. There proclaim the words I tell you, 
JER.19.3	and say, ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.19.4	For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods; they have burned incense in it to gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent. 
JER.19.5	They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind. 
JER.19.6	So beware, the days are coming, declares the 
JER.19.7	“ ‘In this place I will ruin
JER.19.8	I will devastate this city and make it an object of horror and scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds. 
JER.19.9	I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh because their enemies will press the siege so hard against them to destroy them.’
JER.19.10	“Then break the jar while those who go with you are watching, 
JER.19.11	and say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.19.12	This is what I will do to this place and to those who live here, declares the 
JER.19.13	The houses in Jerusalem and those of the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place, Topheth—all the houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the starry hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods.’ ”
JER.19.14	Jeremiah then returned from Topheth, where the 
JER.19.15	“This is what the 
JER.20.1	When the priest Pashhur son of Immer, the official in charge of the temple of the 
JER.20.2	he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin at the 
JER.20.3	The next day, when Pashhur released him from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The 
JER.20.4	For this is what the 
JER.20.5	I will deliver all the wealth of this city into the hands of their enemies—all its products, all its valuables and all the treasures of the kings of Judah. They will take it away as plunder and carry it off to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into exile to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.’ ”
JER.20.7	You deceived
JER.20.7	you overpowered me and prevailed.
JER.20.7	I am ridiculed all day long;
JER.20.7	everyone mocks me.
JER.20.8	Whenever I speak, I cry out
JER.20.8	proclaiming violence and destruction.
JER.20.8	So the word of the 
JER.20.8	insult and reproach all day long.
JER.20.9	But if I say, “I will not mention his word
JER.20.9	or speak anymore in his name,”
JER.20.9	his word is in my heart like a fire,
JER.20.9	a fire shut up in my bones.
JER.20.9	I am weary of holding it in;
JER.20.9	indeed, I cannot.
JER.20.10	I hear many whispering,
JER.20.10	“Terror on every side!
JER.20.10	Denounce him! Let’s denounce him!”
JER.20.10	All my friends
JER.20.10	are waiting for me to slip, saying,
JER.20.10	“Perhaps he will be deceived;
JER.20.10	then we will prevail over him
JER.20.10	and take our revenge on him.”
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.11	so my persecutors will stumble and not prevail.
JER.20.11	They will fail and be thoroughly disgraced;
JER.20.11	their dishonor will never be forgotten.
JER.20.12	and probe the heart and mind,
JER.20.12	let me see your vengeance on them,
JER.20.12	for to you I have committed my cause.
JER.20.13	Sing to the 
JER.20.13	Give praise to the 
JER.20.13	He rescues the life of the needy
JER.20.13	from the hands of the wicked.
JER.20.14	Cursed be the day I was born!
JER.20.14	May the day my mother bore me not be blessed!
JER.20.15	Cursed be the man who brought my father the news,
JER.20.15	who made him very glad, saying,
JER.20.15	“A child is born to you—a son!”
JER.20.16	May that man be like the towns
JER.20.16	the 
JER.20.16	May he hear wailing in the morning,
JER.20.16	a battle cry at noon.
JER.20.17	For he did not kill me in the womb,
JER.20.17	with my mother as my grave,
JER.20.17	her womb enlarged forever.
JER.20.18	Why did I ever come out of the womb
JER.20.18	to see trouble and sorrow
JER.20.18	and to end my days in shame?
JER.21.1	The word came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.21.2	“Inquire now of the 
JER.21.3	But Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah, 
JER.21.4	‘This is what the 
JER.21.5	I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in furious anger and in great wrath. 
JER.21.6	I will strike down those who live in this city—both man and beast—and they will die of a terrible plague. 
JER.21.7	After that, declares the 
JER.21.8	“Furthermore, tell the people, ‘This is what the 
JER.21.9	Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their lives. 
JER.21.10	I have determined to do this city harm and not good, declares the 
JER.21.11	“Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.21.12	This is what the 
JER.21.12	“ ‘Administer justice every morning;
JER.21.12	rescue from the hand of the oppressor
JER.21.12	the one who has been robbed,
JER.21.12	or my wrath will break out and burn like fire
JER.21.12	because of the evil you have done—
JER.21.12	burn with no one to quench it.
JER.21.13	I am against you, Jerusalem,
JER.21.13	you who live above this valley
JER.21.13	on the rocky plateau, declares the 
JER.21.13	you who say, “Who can come against us?
JER.21.13	Who can enter our refuge?”
JER.21.14	I will punish you as your deeds deserve,
JER.21.14	declares the 
JER.21.14	I will kindle a fire in your forests
JER.21.14	that will consume everything around you.’ ”
JER.22.1	This is what the 
JER.22.2	‘Hear the word of the 
JER.22.3	This is what the 
JER.22.4	For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people. 
JER.22.5	But if you do not obey these commands, declares the 
JER.22.6	For this is what the 
JER.22.6	“Though you are like Gilead to me,
JER.22.6	like the summit of Lebanon,
JER.22.6	I will surely make you like a wasteland,
JER.22.6	like towns not inhabited.
JER.22.7	I will send destroyers against you,
JER.22.7	each man with his weapons,
JER.22.7	and they will cut up your fine cedar beams
JER.22.7	and throw them into the fire.
JER.22.8	“People from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another, ‘Why has the 
JER.22.9	And the answer will be: ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the 
JER.22.10	Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss;
JER.22.10	rather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled,
JER.22.10	because he will never return
JER.22.10	nor see his native land again.
JER.22.11	For this is what the 
JER.22.12	He will die in the place where they have led him captive; he will not see this land again.”
JER.22.13	“Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness,
JER.22.13	his upper rooms by injustice,
JER.22.13	making his own people work for nothing,
JER.22.13	not paying them for their labor.
JER.22.14	He says, ‘I will build myself a great palace
JER.22.14	with spacious upper rooms.’
JER.22.14	So he makes large windows in it,
JER.22.14	panels it with cedar
JER.22.14	and decorates it in red.
JER.22.15	“Does it make you a king
JER.22.15	to have more and more cedar?
JER.22.15	Did not your father have food and drink?
JER.22.15	He did what was right and just,
JER.22.15	so all went well with him.
JER.22.16	He defended the cause of the poor and needy,
JER.22.16	and so all went well.
JER.22.16	Is that not what it means to know me?”
JER.22.16	declares the 
JER.22.17	“But your eyes and your heart
JER.22.17	are set only on dishonest gain,
JER.22.17	on shedding innocent blood
JER.22.17	and on oppression and extortion.”
JER.22.18	Therefore this is what the 
JER.22.18	“They will not mourn for him:
JER.22.18	‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!’
JER.22.18	They will not mourn for him:
JER.22.18	‘Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!’
JER.22.19	He will have the burial of a donkey—
JER.22.19	dragged away and thrown
JER.22.19	outside the gates of Jerusalem.”
JER.22.20	“Go up to Lebanon and cry out,
JER.22.20	let your voice be heard in Bashan,
JER.22.20	cry out from Abarim,
JER.22.20	for all your allies are crushed.
JER.22.21	I warned you when you felt secure,
JER.22.21	but you said, ‘I will not listen!’
JER.22.21	This has been your way from your youth;
JER.22.21	you have not obeyed me.
JER.22.22	The wind will drive all your shepherds away,
JER.22.22	and your allies will go into exile.
JER.22.22	Then you will be ashamed and disgraced
JER.22.22	because of all your wickedness.
JER.22.23	You who live in ‘Lebanon,
JER.22.23	who are nestled in cedar buildings,
JER.22.23	how you will groan when pangs come upon you,
JER.22.23	pain like that of a woman in labor!
JER.22.24	“As surely as I live,” declares the 
JER.22.25	I will deliver you into the hands of those who want to kill you, those you fear—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Babylonians.
JER.22.26	I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country, where neither of you was born, and there you both will die. 
JER.22.27	You will never come back to the land you long to return to.”
JER.22.28	Is this man Jehoiachin a despised, broken pot,
JER.22.28	an object no one wants?
JER.22.28	Why will he and his children be hurled out,
JER.22.28	cast into a land they do not know?
JER.22.29	O land, land, land,
JER.22.29	hear the word of the 
JER.22.30	This is what the 
JER.22.30	“Record this man as if childless,
JER.22.30	a man who will not prosper in his lifetime,
JER.22.30	for none of his offspring will prosper,
JER.22.30	none will sit on the throne of David
JER.22.30	or rule anymore in Judah.”
JER.23.1	“Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!” declares the 
JER.23.2	Therefore this is what the 
JER.23.3	“I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number. 
JER.23.4	I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the 
JER.23.5	“The days are coming,” declares the 
JER.23.5	“when I will raise up for David
JER.23.5	a King who will reign wisely
JER.23.5	and do what is just and right in the land.
JER.23.6	In his days Judah will be saved
JER.23.6	and Israel will live in safety.
JER.23.6	This is the name by which he will be called:
JER.23.6	The 
JER.23.7	“So then, the days are coming,” declares the 
JER.23.8	but they will say, ‘As surely as the 
JER.23.9	Concerning the prophets:
JER.23.9	My heart is broken within me;
JER.23.9	all my bones tremble.
JER.23.9	I am like a drunken man,
JER.23.9	like a strong man overcome by wine,
JER.23.9	because of the 
JER.23.9	and his holy words.
JER.23.10	The land is full of adulterers;
JER.23.10	because of the curse
JER.23.10	and the pastures in the wilderness are withered.
JER.23.10	The prophets follow an evil course
JER.23.10	and use their power unjustly.
JER.23.11	“Both prophet and priest are godless;
JER.23.11	even in my temple I find their wickedness,”
JER.23.11	declares the 
JER.23.12	“Therefore their path will become slippery;
JER.23.12	they will be banished to darkness
JER.23.12	and there they will fall.
JER.23.12	I will bring disaster on them
JER.23.12	in the year they are punished,”
JER.23.12	declares the 
JER.23.13	“Among the prophets of Samaria
JER.23.13	I saw this repulsive thing:
JER.23.13	They prophesied by Baal
JER.23.13	and led my people Israel astray.
JER.23.14	And among the prophets of Jerusalem
JER.23.14	I have seen something horrible:
JER.23.14	They commit adultery and live a lie.
JER.23.14	They strengthen the hands of evildoers,
JER.23.14	so that not one of them turns from their wickedness.
JER.23.14	They are all like Sodom to me;
JER.23.14	the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.”
JER.23.15	Therefore this is what the 
JER.23.15	“I will make them eat bitter food
JER.23.15	and drink poisoned water,
JER.23.15	because from the prophets of Jerusalem
JER.23.15	ungodliness has spread throughout the land.”
JER.23.16	This is what the 
JER.23.16	“Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you;
JER.23.16	they fill you with false hopes.
JER.23.16	They speak visions from their own minds,
JER.23.16	not from the mouth of the 
JER.23.17	They keep saying to those who despise me,
JER.23.17	‘The 
JER.23.17	And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts
JER.23.17	they say, ‘No harm will come to you.’
JER.23.18	But which of them has stood in the council of the 
JER.23.18	to see or to hear his word?
JER.23.18	Who has listened and heard his word?
JER.23.19	See, the storm of the 
JER.23.19	will burst out in wrath,
JER.23.19	a whirlwind swirling down
JER.23.19	on the heads of the wicked.
JER.23.20	The anger of the 
JER.23.20	until he fully accomplishes
JER.23.20	the purposes of his heart.
JER.23.20	In days to come
JER.23.20	you will understand it clearly.
JER.23.21	I did not send these prophets,
JER.23.21	yet they have run with their message;
JER.23.21	I did not speak to them,
JER.23.21	yet they have prophesied.
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in my council,
JER.23.22	they would have proclaimed my words to my people
JER.23.22	and would have turned them from their evil ways
JER.23.22	and from their evil deeds.
JER.23.23	“Am I only a God nearby,”
JER.23.23	declares the 
JER.23.23	“and not a God far away?
JER.23.24	Who can hide in secret places
JER.23.24	so that I cannot see them?”
JER.23.24	declares the 
JER.23.24	“Do not I fill heaven and earth?”
JER.23.24	declares the 
JER.23.25	“I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’ 
JER.23.26	How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? 
JER.23.27	They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. 
JER.23.28	Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the 
JER.23.29	“Is not my word like fire,” declares the 
JER.23.30	“Therefore,” declares the 
JER.23.31	Yes,” declares the 
JER.23.32	Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” declares the 
JER.23.33	“When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, ‘What is the message from the 
JER.23.34	If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, ‘This is a message from the 
JER.23.35	This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites: ‘What is the 
JER.23.36	But you must not mention ‘a message from the 
JER.23.37	This is what you keep saying to a prophet: ‘What is the 
JER.23.38	Although you claim, ‘This is a message from the 
JER.23.39	Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors. 
JER.23.40	I will bring on you everlasting disgrace—everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”
JER.24.1	After Jehoiachin
JER.24.2	One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten.
JER.24.3	Then the 
JER.24.3	“Figs,” I answered. “The good ones are very good, but the bad ones are so bad they cannot be eaten.”
JER.24.4	Then the word of the 
JER.24.5	“This is what the 
JER.24.6	My eyes will watch over them for their good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them. 
JER.24.7	I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the 
JER.24.8	“ ‘But like the bad figs, which are so bad they cannot be eaten,’ says the 
JER.24.9	I will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, a curse
JER.24.10	I will send the sword, famine and plague against them until they are destroyed from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.’ ”
JER.25.1	The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. 
JER.25.2	So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem: 
JER.25.3	For twenty-three years—from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day—the word of the 
JER.25.4	And though the 
JER.25.5	They said, “Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the 
JER.25.6	Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not arouse my anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you.”
JER.25.7	“But you did not listen to me,” declares the 
JER.25.8	Therefore the 
JER.25.9	I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,” declares the 
JER.25.10	I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp. 
JER.25.11	This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
JER.25.12	“But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians,
JER.25.13	I will bring on that land all the things I have spoken against it, all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations. 
JER.25.14	They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings; I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”
JER.25.15	This is what the 
JER.25.16	When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them.”
JER.25.17	So I took the cup from the 
JER.25.18	Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn, a curse
JER.25.19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials and all his people, 
JER.25.20	and all the foreign people there; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines (those of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the people left at Ashdod); 
JER.25.21	Edom, Moab and Ammon; 
JER.25.22	all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea; 
JER.25.23	Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who are in distant places
JER.25.24	all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the wilderness; 
JER.25.25	all the kings of Zimri, Elam and Media; 
JER.25.26	and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other—all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshak
JER.25.27	“Then tell them, ‘This is what the 
JER.25.28	But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them, ‘This is what the 
JER.25.29	See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name, and will you indeed go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword on all who live on the earth, declares the 
JER.25.30	“Now prophesy all these words against them and say to them:
JER.25.30	“ ‘The 
JER.25.30	he will thunder from his holy dwelling
JER.25.30	and roar mightily against his land.
JER.25.30	He will shout like those who tread the grapes,
JER.25.30	shout against all who live on the earth.
JER.25.31	The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth,
JER.25.31	for the 
JER.25.31	he will bring judgment on all mankind
JER.25.31	and put the wicked to the sword,’ ”
JER.25.31	declares the 
JER.25.32	This is what the 
JER.25.32	“Look! Disaster is spreading
JER.25.32	from nation to nation;
JER.25.32	a mighty storm is rising
JER.25.32	from the ends of the earth.”
JER.25.33	At that time those slain by the 
JER.25.34	Weep and wail, you shepherds;
JER.25.34	roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock.
JER.25.34	For your time to be slaughtered has come;
JER.25.34	you will fall like the best of the rams.
JER.25.35	The shepherds will have nowhere to flee,
JER.25.35	the leaders of the flock no place to escape.
JER.25.36	Hear the cry of the shepherds,
JER.25.36	the wailing of the leaders of the flock,
JER.25.36	for the 
JER.25.37	The peaceful meadows will be laid waste
JER.25.37	because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.25.38	Like a lion he will leave his lair,
JER.25.38	and their land will become desolate
JER.25.38	because of the sword
JER.25.38	and because of the 
JER.26.1	Early in the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came from the 
JER.26.2	“This is what the 
JER.26.3	Perhaps they will listen and each will turn from their evil ways. Then I will relent and not inflict on them the disaster I was planning because of the evil they have done. 
JER.26.4	Say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.26.5	and if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you again and again (though you have not listened), 
JER.26.6	then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city a curse
JER.26.7	The priests, the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the 
JER.26.8	But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the 
JER.26.9	Why do you prophesy in the 
JER.26.10	When the officials of Judah heard about these things, they went up from the royal palace to the house of the 
JER.26.11	Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people, “This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city. You have heard it with your own ears!”
JER.26.12	Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people: “The 
JER.26.13	Now reform your ways and your actions and obey the 
JER.26.14	As for me, I am in your hands; do with me whatever you think is good and right. 
JER.26.15	Be assured, however, that if you put me to death, you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on those who live in it, for in truth the 
JER.26.16	Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man should not be sentenced to death! He has spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.26.17	Some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people, 
JER.26.18	“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah, ‘This is what the 
JER.26.18	“ ‘Zion will be plowed like a field,
JER.26.18	Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,
JER.26.18	the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.’
JER.26.19	“Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death? Did not Hezekiah fear the 
JER.26.20	(Now Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim was another man who prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.21	When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words, the king was determined to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt. 
JER.26.22	King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Akbor to Egypt, along with some other men. 
JER.26.23	They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.)
JER.26.24	Furthermore, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, and so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.
JER.27.1	Early in the reign of Zedekiah
JER.27.2	This is what the 
JER.27.3	Then send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. 
JER.27.4	Give them a message for their masters and say, ‘This is what the 
JER.27.5	With my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it, and I give it to anyone I please. 
JER.27.6	Now I will give all your countries into the hands of my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; I will make even the wild animals subject to him. 
JER.27.7	All nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his land comes; then many nations and great kings will subjugate him.
JER.27.8	“ ‘ “If, however, any nation or kingdom will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon or bow its neck under his yoke, I will punish that nation with the sword, famine and plague, declares the 
JER.27.9	So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’ 
JER.27.10	They prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove you far from your lands; I will banish you and you will perish. 
JER.27.11	But if any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let that nation remain in its own land to till it and to live there, declares the 
JER.27.12	I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, “Bow your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will live. 
JER.27.13	Why will you and your people die by the sword, famine and plague with which the 
JER.27.14	Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying lies to you. 
JER.27.15	‘I have not sent them,’ declares the 
JER.27.16	Then I said to the priests and all these people, “This is what the 
JER.27.17	Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this city become a ruin? 
JER.27.18	If they are prophets and have the word of the 
JER.27.19	For this is what the 
JER.27.20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiachin
JER.27.21	yes, this is what the 
JER.27.22	‘They will be taken to Babylon and there they will remain until the day I come for them,’ declares the 
JER.28.1	In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the 
JER.28.2	“This is what the 
JER.28.3	Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the 
JER.28.4	I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the 
JER.28.6	He said, “Amen! May the 
JER.28.7	Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: 
JER.28.8	From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms. 
JER.28.9	But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the 
JER.28.10	Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it, 
JER.28.11	and he said before all the people, “This is what the 
JER.28.12	After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the

JER.28.17	In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died.
JER.29.1	This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
JER.29.2	(This was after King Jehoiachin
JER.29.3	He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It said:

JER.29.12	Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.

JER.29.29	Zephaniah the priest, however, read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet.

JER.31.8	and gather them from the ends of the earth.
JER.31.8	Among them will be the blind and the lame,
JER.31.8	expectant mothers and women in labor;
JER.31.8	a great throng will return.

JER.31.12	the young of the flocks and herds.
JER.31.12	They will be like a well-watered garden,
JER.31.12	and they will sorrow no more.
JER.31.13	Then young women will dance and be glad,
JER.31.13	young men and old as well.
JER.31.13	I will turn their mourning into gladness;
JER.31.13	I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow.
JER.31.14	I will satisfy the priests with abundance,
JER.31.14	and my people will be filled with my bounty,”
JER.31.14	declares the 
JER.31.15	This is what the 
JER.31.15	“A voice is heard in Ramah,
JER.31.15	mourning and great weeping,
JER.31.15	Rachel weeping for her children
JER.31.15	and refusing to be comforted,
JER.31.15	because they are no more.”
JER.31.16	This is what the 
JER.31.16	“Restrain your voice from weeping
JER.31.16	and your eyes from tears,
JER.31.16	for your work will be rewarded,”
JER.31.16	declares the 
JER.31.16	“They will return from the land of the enemy.
JER.31.17	So there is hope for your descendants,”
JER.31.17	declares the 
JER.31.17	“Your children will return to their own land.
JER.31.18	“I have surely heard Ephraim’s moaning:
JER.31.18	‘You disciplined me like an unruly calf,
JER.31.18	and I have been disciplined.
JER.31.18	Restore me, and I will return,
JER.31.18	because you are the 
JER.31.19	After I strayed,
JER.31.19	I repented;
JER.31.19	after I came to understand,
JER.31.19	I beat my breast.
JER.31.19	I was ashamed and humiliated
JER.31.19	because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’
JER.31.20	Is not Ephraim my dear son,
JER.31.20	the child in whom I delight?
JER.31.20	Though I often speak against him,
JER.31.20	I still remember him.
JER.31.20	Therefore my heart yearns for him;
JER.31.20	I have great compassion for him,”
JER.31.20	declares the 
JER.31.21	“Set up road signs;
JER.31.21	put up guideposts.
JER.31.21	Take note of the highway,
JER.31.21	the road that you take.

JER.31.24	People will live together in Judah and all its towns—farmers and those who move about with their flocks. 
JER.31.25	I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.”
JER.31.26	At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been pleasant to me.
JER.31.27	“The days are coming,” declares the 
JER.31.28	Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, and to overthrow, destroy and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares the 
JER.31.29	“In those days people will no longer say,
JER.31.29	‘The parents have eaten sour grapes,
JER.31.29	and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’
JER.31.30	Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge.
JER.31.31	“The days are coming,” declares the 
JER.31.31	“when I will make a new covenant
JER.31.31	with the people of Israel
JER.31.31	and with the people of Judah.
JER.31.32	It will not be like the covenant
JER.31.32	I made with their ancestors
JER.31.32	when I took them by the hand
JER.31.32	to lead them out of Egypt,

JER.31.34	or say to one another, ‘Know the 
JER.31.34	because they will all know me,
JER.31.34	from the least of them to the greatest,”
JER.31.34	declares the 
JER.31.34	“For I will forgive their wickedness
JER.31.34	and will remember their sins no more.”
JER.31.35	This is what the 
JER.31.35	he who appoints the sun
JER.31.35	to shine by day,
JER.31.35	who decrees the moon and stars
JER.31.35	to shine by night,

JER.31.35	so that its waves roar—

JER.31.36	“Only if these decrees vanish from my sight,”
JER.31.36	declares the 
JER.31.36	“will Israel ever cease
JER.31.36	being a nation before me.”

JER.31.37	“Only if the heavens above can be measured
JER.31.37	and the foundations of the earth below be searched out
JER.31.37	will I reject all the descendants of Israel
JER.31.37	because of all they have done,”
JER.31.37	declares the 
JER.31.38	“The days are coming,” declares the 
JER.31.39	The measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to Goah. 
JER.31.40	The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown, and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be holy to the 
JER.32.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.32.2	The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah.
JER.32.3	Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, “Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, ‘This is what the 
JER.32.4	Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape the Babylonians
JER.32.5	He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with him, declares the 
JER.32.6	Jeremiah said, “The word of the 
JER.32.7	Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.’
JER.32.8	“Then, just as the 
JER.32.8	“I knew that this was the word of the 
JER.32.9	so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels
JER.32.10	I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales. 
JER.32.11	I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy— 
JER.32.12	and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
JER.32.13	“In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions: 
JER.32.14	‘This is what the 
JER.32.15	For this is what the 
JER.32.16	“After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the 
JER.32.17	“Ah, Sovereign 
JER.32.18	You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the parents’ sins into the laps of their children after them. Great and mighty God, whose name is the 
JER.32.19	great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds. Your eyes are open to the ways of all mankind; you reward each person according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve. 
JER.32.20	You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours. 
JER.32.21	You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror. 
JER.32.22	You gave them this land you had sworn to give their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
JER.32.23	They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster on them.
JER.32.24	“See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the sword, famine and plague, the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians who are attacking it. What you said has happened, as you now see. 
JER.32.25	And though the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians, you, Sovereign

JER.32.27	“I am the 
JER.32.28	Therefore this is what the 
JER.32.29	The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people aroused my anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.
JER.32.30	“The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but arouse my anger with what their hands have made, declares the 
JER.32.31	From the day it was built until now, this city has so aroused my anger and wrath that I must remove it from my sight. 
JER.32.32	The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done—they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem. 
JER.32.33	They turned their backs to me and not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline. 
JER.32.34	They set up their vile images in the house that bears my Name and defiled it. 
JER.32.35	They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molek, though I never commanded—nor did it enter my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin.
JER.32.36	“You are saying about this city, ‘By the sword, famine and plague it will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon’; but this is what the 
JER.32.37	I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety. 
JER.32.38	They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
JER.32.39	I will give them singleness of heart and action, so that they will always fear me and that all will then go well for them and for their children after them. 
JER.32.40	I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me. 
JER.32.41	I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.
JER.32.42	“This is what the 
JER.32.43	Once more fields will be bought in this land of which you say, ‘It is a desolate waste, without people or animals, for it has been given into the hands of the Babylonians.’ 
JER.32.44	Fields will be bought for silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed and witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes,
JER.33.1	While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the 
JER.33.2	“This is what the 
JER.33.3	‘Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.’ 
JER.33.4	For this is what the 
JER.33.5	in the fight with the Babylonians
JER.33.6	“ ‘Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security. 
JER.33.7	I will bring Judah and Israel back from captivity
JER.33.8	I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me. 
JER.33.9	Then this city will bring me renown, joy, praise and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it; and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.’
JER.33.10	“This is what the 
JER.33.11	the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the 
JER.33.11	“Give thanks to the 
JER.33.11	for the 
JER.33.11	his love endures forever.”
JER.33.11	For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before,’ says the 
JER.33.12	“This is what the 
JER.33.13	In the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them,’ says the 
JER.33.14	“ ‘The days are coming,’ declares the 
JER.33.15	“ ‘In those days and at that time
JER.33.15	I will make a righteous Branch sprout from David’s line;
JER.33.15	he will do what is just and right in the land.
JER.33.16	In those days Judah will be saved
JER.33.16	and Jerusalem will live in safety.
JER.33.16	This is the name by which it

JER.33.17	For this is what the 
JER.33.18	nor will the Levitical priests ever fail to have a man to stand before me continually to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings and to present sacrifices.’ ”
JER.33.19	The word of the 
JER.33.20	“This is what the 
JER.33.21	then my covenant with David my servant—and my covenant with the Levites who are priests ministering before me—can be broken and David will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne. 
JER.33.22	I will make the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me as countless as the stars in the sky and as measureless as the sand on the seashore.’ ”
JER.33.23	The word of the 
JER.33.24	“Have you not noticed that these people are saying, ‘The 
JER.33.25	This is what the 
JER.33.26	then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes
JER.34.1	While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns, this word came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.2	“This is what the 
JER.34.3	You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and given into his hands. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon.
JER.34.4	“ ‘Yet hear the 
JER.34.5	you will die peacefully. As people made a funeral fire in honor of your predecessors, the kings who ruled before you, so they will make a fire in your honor and lament, “Alas, master!” I myself make this promise, declares the 
JER.34.6	Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem, 
JER.34.7	while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that were still holding out—Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in Judah.
JER.34.8	The word came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.9	Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. 
JER.34.10	So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. 
JER.34.11	But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
JER.34.12	Then the word of the 
JER.34.13	“This is what the 
JER.34.14	‘Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.’
JER.34.15	Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. 
JER.34.16	But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
JER.34.17	“Therefore this is what the 
JER.34.18	Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces. 
JER.34.19	The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf, 
JER.34.20	I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.
JER.34.21	“I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you. 
JER.34.22	I am going to give the order, declares the 
JER.35.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.35.2	“Go to the Rekabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the 
JER.35.3	So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the whole family of the Rekabites. 
JER.35.4	I brought them into the house of the 
JER.35.5	Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the Rekabites and said to them, “Drink some wine.”
JER.35.6	But they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jehonadab
JER.35.7	Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things, but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads.’ 
JER.35.8	We have obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine 
JER.35.9	or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields or crops. 
JER.35.10	We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab commanded us. 
JER.35.11	But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, ‘Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian
JER.35.12	Then the word of the 
JER.35.13	“This is what the 
JER.35.14	‘Jehonadab son of Rekab ordered his descendants not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me. 
JER.35.15	Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, “Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you have not paid attention or listened to me. 
JER.35.16	The descendants of Jehonadab son of Rekab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.’
JER.35.17	“Therefore this is what the 
JER.35.18	Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites, “This is what the 
JER.35.19	Therefore this is what the 
JER.36.1	In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.36.2	“Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now. 
JER.36.3	Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, they will each turn from their wicked ways; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin.”
JER.36.4	So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the 
JER.36.5	Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am restricted; I am not allowed to go to the 
JER.36.6	So you go to the house of the 
JER.36.7	Perhaps they will bring their petition before the 
JER.36.8	Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the 
JER.36.9	In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the 
JER.36.10	From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the 
JER.36.11	When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the 
JER.36.12	he went down to the secretary’s room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. 
JER.36.13	After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll, 
JER.36.14	all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand. 
JER.36.15	They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.”
JER.36.15	So Baruch read it to them. 
JER.36.16	When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.” 
JER.36.17	Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?”
JER.36.18	“Yes,” Baruch replied, “he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.”
JER.36.19	Then the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”
JER.36.20	After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him. 
JER.36.21	The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him. 
JER.36.22	It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him. 
JER.36.23	Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire. 
JER.36.24	The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes. 
JER.36.25	Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. 
JER.36.26	Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the 
JER.36.27	After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the 
JER.36.28	“Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. 
JER.36.29	Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘This is what the 
JER.36.30	Therefore this is what the 
JER.36.31	I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.’ ”
JER.36.32	So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
JER.37.1	Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin
JER.37.2	Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the 
JER.37.3	King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehukal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: “Please pray to the 
JER.37.4	Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison. 
JER.37.5	Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians
JER.37.6	Then the word of the 
JER.37.7	“This is what the 
JER.37.8	Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.’
JER.37.9	“This is what the 
JER.37.10	Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian
JER.37.11	After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, 
JER.37.12	Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there. 
JER.37.13	But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!”
JER.37.14	“That’s not true!” Jeremiah said. “I am not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. 
JER.37.15	They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison.
JER.37.16	Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time. 
JER.37.17	Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, “Is there any word from the 
JER.37.17	“Yes,” Jeremiah replied, “you will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.”
JER.37.18	Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against you or your attendants or this people, that you have put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land’? 
JER.37.20	But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there.”
JER.37.21	King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
JER.38.1	Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehukal
JER.38.2	“This is what the 
JER.38.3	And this is what the 
JER.38.4	Then the officials said to the king, “This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin.”
JER.38.5	“He is in your hands,” King Zedekiah answered. “The king can do nothing to oppose you.”
JER.38.6	So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.
JER.38.7	But Ebed-Melek, a Cushite,
JER.38.8	Ebed-Melek went out of the palace and said to him, 
JER.38.9	“My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city.”
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebed-Melek the Cushite, “Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”
JER.38.11	So Ebed-Melek took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern. 
JER.38.12	Ebed-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did so, 
JER.38.13	and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
JER.38.14	Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the 
JER.38.15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I give you an answer, will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me.”
JER.38.16	But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: “As surely as the 
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the 
JER.38.18	But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from them.’ ”
JER.38.19	King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me.”
JER.38.20	“They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the 
JER.38.21	But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the 
JER.38.22	All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you:
JER.38.22	“ ‘They misled you and overcame you—
JER.38.22	those trusted friends of yours.
JER.38.22	Your feet are sunk in the mud;
JER.38.22	your friends have deserted you.’
JER.38.23	“All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will
JER.38.24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may die. 
JER.38.25	If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,’ 
JER.38.26	then tell them, ‘I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan’s house to die there.’ ”
JER.38.27	All the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard his conversation with the king.
JER.38.28	And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
JER.38.28	This is how Jerusalem was taken:
JER.39.1	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it. 
JER.39.2	And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, the city wall was broken through. 
JER.39.3	Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon. 
JER.39.4	When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they left the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls, and headed toward the Arabah.
JER.39.5	But the Babylonian
JER.39.6	There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah. 
JER.39.7	Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.
JER.39.8	The Babylonians
JER.39.9	Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon the people who remained in the city, along with those who had gone over to him, and the rest of the people. 
JER.39.10	But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people, who owned nothing; and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields.
JER.39.11	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard: 
JER.39.12	“Take him and look after him; don’t harm him but do for him whatever he asks.” 
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, Nebushazban a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officers of the king of Babylon 
JER.39.14	sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him back to his home. So he remained among his own people.
JER.39.15	While Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the 
JER.39.16	“Go and tell Ebed-Melek the Cushite, ‘This is what the 
JER.39.17	But I will rescue you on that day, declares the 
JER.39.18	I will save you; you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life, because you trust in me, declares the 
JER.40.1	The word came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.40.2	When the commander of the guard found Jeremiah, he said to him, “The 
JER.40.3	And now the 
JER.40.4	But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. Come with me to Babylon, if you like, and I will look after you; but if you do not want to, then don’t come. Look, the whole country lies before you; go wherever you please.” 
JER.40.5	However, before Jeremiah turned to go,
JER.40.5	Then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go. 
JER.40.6	So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.
JER.40.7	When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon, 
JER.40.8	they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah
JER.40.9	Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. “Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians,
JER.40.10	I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us, but you are to harvest the wine, summer fruit and olive oil, and put them in your storage jars, and live in the towns you have taken over.”
JER.40.11	When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them, 
JER.40.12	they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit.
JER.40.13	Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 
JER.40.14	and said to him, “Don’t you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.
JER.40.15	Then Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, “Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?”
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true.”
JER.41.1	In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood and had been one of the king’s officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating together there, 
JER.41.2	Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land. 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian
JER.41.4	The day after Gedaliah’s assassination, before anyone knew about it, 
JER.41.5	eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the 
JER.41.6	Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.” 
JER.41.7	When they went into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern. 
JER.41.8	But ten of them said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us! We have wheat and barley, olive oil and honey, hidden in a field.” So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others. 
JER.41.9	Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.
JER.41.10	Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah—the king’s daughters along with all the others who were left there, over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
JER.41.11	When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed, 
JER.41.12	they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him, they were glad. 
JER.41.14	All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites.
JER.41.16	Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the people of Mizpah who had survived, whom Johanan had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam—the soldiers, women, children and court officials he had recovered from Gibeon. 
JER.41.17	And they went on, stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt 
JER.41.18	to escape the Babylonians.
JER.42.1	Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah
JER.42.2	Jeremiah the prophet and said to him, “Please hear our petition and pray to the 
JER.42.3	Pray that the 
JER.42.4	“I have heard you,” replied Jeremiah the prophet. “I will certainly pray to the 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the 
JER.42.6	Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the 
JER.42.7	Ten days later the word of the 
JER.42.8	So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest. 
JER.42.9	He said to them, “This is what the 
JER.42.10	‘If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I have relented concerning the disaster I have inflicted on you. 
JER.42.11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the 
JER.42.12	I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land.’
JER.42.13	“However, if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ and so disobey the 
JER.42.14	and if you say, ‘No, we will go and live in Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread,’ 
JER.42.15	then hear the word of the 
JER.42.16	then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die. 
JER.42.17	Indeed, all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, famine and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.’ 
JER.42.18	This is what the 
JER.42.19	“Remnant of Judah, the 
JER.42.20	that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the 
JER.42.21	I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the 
JER.42.22	So now, be sure of this: You will die by the sword, famine and plague in the place where you want to go to settle.”
JER.43.1	When Jeremiah had finished telling the people all the words of the 
JER.43.2	Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are lying! The 
JER.43.3	But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians,
JER.43.4	So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the 
JER.43.5	Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered. 
JER.43.6	They also led away all those whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan—the men, the women, the children and the king’s daughters. And they took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah along with them. 
JER.43.7	So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the 
JER.43.8	In Tahpanhes the word of the 
JER.43.9	“While the Jews are watching, take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes. 
JER.43.10	Then say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.43.11	He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword. 
JER.43.12	He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn their temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd picks his garment clean of lice, so he will pick Egypt clean and depart. 
JER.43.13	There in the temple of the sun
JER.44.1	This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis—and in Upper Egypt: 
JER.44.2	“This is what the 
JER.44.3	because of the evil they have done. They aroused my anger by burning incense to and worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever knew. 
JER.44.4	Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, ‘Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!’ 
JER.44.5	But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods. 
JER.44.6	Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today.
JER.44.7	“Now this is what the 
JER.44.8	Why arouse my anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves a curse
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your ancestors.
JER.44.11	“Therefore this is what the 
JER.44.12	I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach. 
JER.44.13	I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem. 
JER.44.14	None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives.”
JER.44.15	Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present—a large assembly—and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah, 
JER.44.16	“We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.44.17	We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our ancestors, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm. 
JER.44.18	But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine.”
JER.44.19	The women added, “When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes impressed with her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?”
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him, 
JER.44.21	“Did not the 
JER.44.22	When the 
JER.44.23	Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the 
JER.44.24	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, “Hear the word of the 
JER.44.25	This is what the 
JER.44.25	“Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows! 
JER.44.26	But hear the word of the 
JER.44.27	For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed. 
JER.44.28	Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs.
JER.44.29	“ ‘This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,’ declares the 
JER.44.30	This is what the 
JER.45.1	When Baruch son of Neriah wrote on a scroll the words Jeremiah the prophet dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, Jeremiah said this to Baruch: 
JER.45.2	“This is what the 
JER.45.3	You said, ‘Woe to me! The 
JER.45.4	But the 
JER.45.5	Should you then seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the 
JER.46.1	This is the word of the 
JER.46.2	Concerning Egypt:
JER.46.2	This is the message against the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
JER.46.3	“Prepare your shields, both large and small,
JER.46.3	and march out for battle!
JER.46.4	Harness the horses,
JER.46.4	mount the steeds!
JER.46.4	Take your positions
JER.46.4	with helmets on!
JER.46.4	Polish your spears,
JER.46.4	put on your armor!
JER.46.5	What do I see?
JER.46.5	They are terrified,
JER.46.5	they are retreating,
JER.46.5	their warriors are defeated.
JER.46.5	They flee in haste
JER.46.5	without looking back,
JER.46.5	and there is terror on every side,”
JER.46.5	declares the 
JER.46.6	“The swift cannot flee
JER.46.6	nor the strong escape.
JER.46.6	In the north by the River Euphrates
JER.46.6	they stumble and fall.
JER.46.7	“Who is this that rises like the Nile,
JER.46.7	like rivers of surging waters?
JER.46.8	Egypt rises like the Nile,
JER.46.8	like rivers of surging waters.
JER.46.8	She says, ‘I will rise and cover the earth;
JER.46.8	I will destroy cities and their people.’
JER.46.9	Charge, you horses!
JER.46.9	Drive furiously, you charioteers!
JER.46.9	March on, you warriors—men of Cush
JER.46.9	men of Lydia who draw the bow.
JER.46.10	But that day belongs to the Lord, the 
JER.46.10	a day of vengeance, for vengeance on his foes.
JER.46.10	The sword will devour till it is satisfied,
JER.46.10	till it has quenched its thirst with blood.
JER.46.10	For the Lord, the 
JER.46.10	in the land of the north by the River Euphrates.
JER.46.11	“Go up to Gilead and get balm,
JER.46.11	Virgin Daughter Egypt.
JER.46.11	But you try many medicines in vain;
JER.46.11	there is no healing for you.
JER.46.12	The nations will hear of your shame;
JER.46.12	your cries will fill the earth.
JER.46.12	One warrior will stumble over another;
JER.46.12	both will fall down together.”
JER.46.13	This is the message the 
JER.46.14	“Announce this in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol;
JER.46.14	proclaim it also in Memphis and Tahpanhes:
JER.46.14	‘Take your positions and get ready,
JER.46.14	for the sword devours those around you.’
JER.46.15	Why will your warriors be laid low?
JER.46.15	They cannot stand, for the 
JER.46.16	They will stumble repeatedly;
JER.46.16	they will fall over each other.
JER.46.16	They will say, ‘Get up, let us go back
JER.46.16	to our own people and our native lands,
JER.46.16	away from the sword of the oppressor.’
JER.46.17	There they will exclaim,
JER.46.17	‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is only a loud noise;
JER.46.17	he has missed his opportunity.’
JER.46.18	“As surely as I live,” declares the King,
JER.46.18	whose name is the 
JER.46.18	“one will come who is like Tabor among the mountains,
JER.46.18	like Carmel by the sea.
JER.46.19	Pack your belongings for exile,
JER.46.19	you who live in Egypt,
JER.46.19	for Memphis will be laid waste
JER.46.19	and lie in ruins without inhabitant.
JER.46.20	“Egypt is a beautiful heifer,
JER.46.20	but a gadfly is coming
JER.46.20	against her from the north.
JER.46.21	The mercenaries in her ranks
JER.46.21	are like fattened calves.
JER.46.21	They too will turn and flee together,
JER.46.21	they will not stand their ground,
JER.46.21	for the day of disaster is coming upon them,
JER.46.21	the time for them to be punished.
JER.46.22	Egypt will hiss like a fleeing serpent
JER.46.22	as the enemy advances in force;
JER.46.22	they will come against her with axes,
JER.46.22	like men who cut down trees.
JER.46.23	They will chop down her forest,”
JER.46.23	declares the 
JER.46.23	“dense though it be.
JER.46.23	They are more numerous than locusts,
JER.46.23	they cannot be counted.
JER.46.24	Daughter Egypt will be put to shame,
JER.46.24	given into the hands of the people of the north.”
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	I will give them into the hands of those who want to kill them—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Later, however, Egypt will be inhabited as in times past,” declares the 
JER.46.27	“Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant;
JER.46.27	do not be dismayed, Israel.
JER.46.27	I will surely save you out of a distant place,
JER.46.27	your descendants from the land of their exile.
JER.46.27	Jacob will again have peace and security,
JER.46.27	and no one will make him afraid.
JER.46.28	Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant,
JER.46.28	for I am with you,” declares the 
JER.46.28	“Though I completely destroy all the nations
JER.46.28	among which I scatter you,
JER.46.28	I will not completely destroy you.
JER.46.28	I will discipline you but only in due measure;
JER.46.28	I will not let you go entirely unpunished.”
JER.47.1	This is the word of the 
JER.47.2	This is what the 
JER.47.2	“See how the waters are rising in the north;
JER.47.2	they will become an overflowing torrent.
JER.47.2	They will overflow the land and everything in it,
JER.47.2	the towns and those who live in them.
JER.47.2	The people will cry out;
JER.47.2	all who dwell in the land will wail
JER.47.3	at the sound of the hooves of galloping steeds,
JER.47.3	at the noise of enemy chariots
JER.47.3	and the rumble of their wheels.
JER.47.3	Parents will not turn to help their children;
JER.47.3	their hands will hang limp.
JER.47.4	For the day has come
JER.47.4	to destroy all the Philistines
JER.47.4	and to remove all survivors
JER.47.4	who could help Tyre and Sidon.
JER.47.4	The 
JER.47.4	the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.
JER.47.5	Gaza will shave her head in mourning;
JER.47.5	Ashkelon will be silenced.
JER.47.5	You remnant on the plain,
JER.47.5	how long will you cut yourselves?
JER.47.6	“ ‘Alas, sword of the 
JER.47.6	how long till you rest?
JER.47.6	Return to your sheath;
JER.47.6	cease and be still.’
JER.47.7	But how can it rest
JER.47.7	when the 
JER.47.7	when he has ordered it
JER.47.7	to attack Ashkelon and the coast?”
JER.48.1	Concerning Moab:
JER.48.1	This is what the 
JER.48.1	“Woe to Nebo, for it will be ruined.
JER.48.1	Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured;
JER.48.1	the stronghold
JER.48.2	Moab will be praised no more;
JER.48.2	in Heshbon
JER.48.2	‘Come, let us put an end to that nation.’
JER.48.2	You, the people of Madmen,
JER.48.2	the sword will pursue you.
JER.48.3	Cries of anguish arise from Horonaim,
JER.48.3	cries of great havoc and destruction.
JER.48.4	Moab will be broken;
JER.48.4	her little ones will cry out.
JER.48.5	They go up the hill to Luhith,
JER.48.5	weeping bitterly as they go;
JER.48.5	on the road down to Horonaim
JER.48.5	anguished cries over the destruction are heard.
JER.48.6	Flee! Run for your lives;
JER.48.6	become like a bush
JER.48.7	Since you trust in your deeds and riches,
JER.48.7	you too will be taken captive,
JER.48.7	and Chemosh will go into exile,
JER.48.7	together with his priests and officials.
JER.48.8	The destroyer will come against every town,
JER.48.8	and not a town will escape.
JER.48.8	The valley will be ruined
JER.48.8	and the plateau destroyed,
JER.48.8	because the 
JER.48.9	Put salt on Moab,
JER.48.9	for she will be laid waste
JER.48.9	her towns will become desolate,
JER.48.9	with no one to live in them.
JER.48.10	“A curse on anyone who is lax in doing the 
JER.48.10	A curse on anyone who keeps their sword from bloodshed!
JER.48.11	“Moab has been at rest from youth,
JER.48.11	like wine left on its dregs,
JER.48.11	not poured from one jar to another—
JER.48.11	she has not gone into exile.
JER.48.11	So she tastes as she did,
JER.48.11	and her aroma is unchanged.
JER.48.12	But days are coming,”
JER.48.12	declares the 
JER.48.12	“when I will send men who pour from pitchers,
JER.48.12	and they will pour her out;
JER.48.12	they will empty her pitchers
JER.48.12	and smash her jars.
JER.48.13	Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,
JER.48.13	as Israel was ashamed
JER.48.13	when they trusted in Bethel.
JER.48.14	“How can you say, ‘We are warriors,
JER.48.14	men valiant in battle’?
JER.48.15	Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded;
JER.48.15	her finest young men will go down in the slaughter,”
JER.48.15	declares the King, whose name is the 
JER.48.16	“The fall of Moab is at hand;
JER.48.16	her calamity will come quickly.
JER.48.17	Mourn for her, all who live around her,
JER.48.17	all who know her fame;
JER.48.17	say, ‘How broken is the mighty scepter,
JER.48.17	how broken the glorious staff!’
JER.48.18	“Come down from your glory
JER.48.18	and sit on the parched ground,
JER.48.18	you inhabitants of Daughter Dibon,
JER.48.18	for the one who destroys Moab
JER.48.18	will come up against you
JER.48.18	and ruin your fortified cities.
JER.48.19	Stand by the road and watch,
JER.48.19	you who live in Aroer.
JER.48.19	Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping,
JER.48.19	ask them, ‘What has happened?’
JER.48.20	Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered.
JER.48.20	Wail and cry out!
JER.48.20	Announce by the Arnon
JER.48.20	that Moab is destroyed.
JER.48.21	Judgment has come to the plateau—
JER.48.21	to Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath,
JER.48.22	to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim,
JER.48.23	to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon,
JER.48.24	to Kerioth and Bozrah—
JER.48.24	to all the towns of Moab, far and near.
JER.48.25	Moab’s horn
JER.48.25	her arm is broken,”
JER.48.25	declares the 
JER.48.26	“Make her drunk,
JER.48.26	for she has defied the 
JER.48.26	Let Moab wallow in her vomit;
JER.48.26	let her be an object of ridicule.
JER.48.27	Was not Israel the object of your ridicule?
JER.48.27	Was she caught among thieves,
JER.48.27	that you shake your head in scorn
JER.48.27	whenever you speak of her?
JER.48.28	Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks,
JER.48.28	you who live in Moab.
JER.48.28	Be like a dove that makes its nest
JER.48.28	at the mouth of a cave.
JER.48.29	“We have heard of Moab’s pride—
JER.48.29	how great is her arrogance!—
JER.48.29	of her insolence, her pride, her conceit
JER.48.29	and the haughtiness of her heart.
JER.48.30	I know her insolence but it is futile,”
JER.48.30	declares the 
JER.48.30	“and her boasts accomplish nothing.
JER.48.31	Therefore I wail over Moab,
JER.48.31	for all Moab I cry out,
JER.48.31	I moan for the people of Kir Hareseth.
JER.48.32	I weep for you, as Jazer weeps,
JER.48.32	you vines of Sibmah.
JER.48.32	Your branches spread as far as the sea
JER.48.32	they reached as far as
JER.48.32	The destroyer has fallen
JER.48.32	on your ripened fruit and grapes.
JER.48.33	Joy and gladness are gone
JER.48.33	from the orchards and fields of Moab.
JER.48.33	I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses;
JER.48.33	no one treads them with shouts of joy.
JER.48.33	Although there are shouts,
JER.48.33	they are not shouts of joy.
JER.48.34	“The sound of their cry rises
JER.48.34	from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz,
JER.48.34	from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah,
JER.48.34	for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up.
JER.48.35	In Moab I will put an end
JER.48.35	to those who make offerings on the high places
JER.48.35	and burn incense to their gods,”
JER.48.35	declares the 
JER.48.36	“So my heart laments for Moab like the music of a pipe;
JER.48.36	it laments like a pipe for the people of Kir Hareseth.
JER.48.36	The wealth they acquired is gone.
JER.48.37	Every head is shaved
JER.48.37	and every beard cut off;
JER.48.37	every hand is slashed
JER.48.37	and every waist is covered with sackcloth.
JER.48.38	On all the roofs in Moab
JER.48.38	and in the public squares
JER.48.38	there is nothing but mourning,
JER.48.38	for I have broken Moab
JER.48.38	like a jar that no one wants,”
JER.48.38	declares the 
JER.48.39	“How shattered she is! How they wail!
JER.48.39	How Moab turns her back in shame!
JER.48.39	Moab has become an object of ridicule,
JER.48.39	an object of horror to all those around her.”
JER.48.40	This is what the 
JER.48.40	“Look! An eagle is swooping down,
JER.48.40	spreading its wings over Moab.
JER.48.41	Kerioth
JER.48.41	and the strongholds taken.
JER.48.41	In that day the hearts of Moab’s warriors
JER.48.41	will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
JER.48.42	Moab will be destroyed as a nation
JER.48.42	because she defied the 
JER.48.43	Terror and pit and snare await you,
JER.48.43	you people of Moab,”
JER.48.43	declares the 
JER.48.44	“Whoever flees from the terror
JER.48.44	will fall into a pit,
JER.48.44	whoever climbs out of the pit
JER.48.44	will be caught in a snare;
JER.48.44	for I will bring on Moab
JER.48.44	the year of her punishment,”
JER.48.44	declares the 
JER.48.45	“In the shadow of Heshbon
JER.48.45	the fugitives stand helpless,
JER.48.45	for a fire has gone out from Heshbon,
JER.48.45	a blaze from the midst of Sihon;
JER.48.45	it burns the foreheads of Moab,
JER.48.45	the skulls of the noisy boasters.
JER.48.46	Woe to you, Moab!
JER.48.46	The people of Chemosh are destroyed;
JER.48.46	your sons are taken into exile
JER.48.46	and your daughters into captivity.
JER.48.47	“Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab
JER.48.47	in days to come,”
JER.48.47	declares the 
JER.48.47	Here ends the judgment on Moab.
JER.49.1	Concerning the Ammonites:
JER.49.1	This is what the 
JER.49.1	“Has Israel no sons?
JER.49.1	Has Israel no heir?
JER.49.1	Why then has Molek
JER.49.1	Why do his people live in its towns?
JER.49.2	But the days are coming,”
JER.49.2	declares the 
JER.49.2	“when I will sound the battle cry
JER.49.2	against Rabbah of the Ammonites;
JER.49.2	it will become a mound of ruins,
JER.49.2	and its surrounding villages will be set on fire.
JER.49.2	Then Israel will drive out
JER.49.2	those who drove her out,”
JER.49.2	says the 
JER.49.3	“Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is destroyed!
JER.49.3	Cry out, you inhabitants of Rabbah!
JER.49.3	Put on sackcloth and mourn;
JER.49.3	rush here and there inside the walls,
JER.49.3	for Molek will go into exile,
JER.49.3	together with his priests and officials.
JER.49.4	Why do you boast of your valleys,
JER.49.4	boast of your valleys so fruitful?
JER.49.4	Unfaithful Daughter Ammon,
JER.49.4	you trust in your riches and say,
JER.49.4	‘Who will attack me?’
JER.49.5	I will bring terror on you
JER.49.5	from all those around you,”
JER.49.5	declares the Lord, the 
JER.49.5	“Every one of you will be driven away,
JER.49.5	and no one will gather the fugitives.
JER.49.6	“Yet afterward, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites,”
JER.49.6	declares the 
JER.49.7	Concerning Edom:
JER.49.7	This is what the 
JER.49.7	“Is there no longer wisdom in Teman?
JER.49.7	Has counsel perished from the prudent?
JER.49.7	Has their wisdom decayed?
JER.49.8	Turn and flee, hide in deep caves,
JER.49.8	you who live in Dedan,
JER.49.8	for I will bring disaster on Esau
JER.49.8	at the time when I punish him.
JER.49.9	If grape pickers came to you,
JER.49.9	would they not leave a few grapes?
JER.49.9	If thieves came during the night,
JER.49.9	would they not steal only as much as they wanted?
JER.49.10	But I will strip Esau bare;
JER.49.10	I will uncover his hiding places,
JER.49.10	so that he cannot conceal himself.
JER.49.10	His armed men are destroyed,
JER.49.10	also his allies and neighbors,
JER.49.10	so there is no one to say,
JER.49.11	‘Leave your fatherless children; I will keep them alive.
JER.49.11	Your widows too can depend on me.’ ”
JER.49.12	This is what the 
JER.49.13	I swear by myself,” declares the 
JER.49.14	I have heard a message from the 
JER.49.14	an envoy was sent to the nations to say,
JER.49.14	“Assemble yourselves to attack it!
JER.49.14	Rise up for battle!”
JER.49.15	“Now I will make you small among the nations,
JER.49.15	despised by mankind.
JER.49.16	The terror you inspire
JER.49.16	and the pride of your heart have deceived you,
JER.49.16	you who live in the clefts of the rocks,
JER.49.16	who occupy the heights of the hill.
JER.49.16	Though you build your nest as high as the eagle’s,
JER.49.16	from there I will bring you down,”
JER.49.16	declares the 
JER.49.17	“Edom will become an object of horror;
JER.49.17	all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff
JER.49.17	because of all its wounds.
JER.49.18	As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown,
JER.49.18	along with their neighboring towns,”
JER.49.18	says the 
JER.49.18	“so no one will live there;
JER.49.18	no people will dwell in it.
JER.49.19	“Like a lion coming up from Jordan’s thickets
JER.49.19	to a rich pastureland,
JER.49.19	I will chase Edom from its land in an instant.
JER.49.19	Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this?
JER.49.19	Who is like me and who can challenge me?
JER.49.19	And what shepherd can stand against me?”
JER.49.20	Therefore, hear what the 
JER.49.20	what he has purposed against those who live in Teman:
JER.49.20	The young of the flock will be dragged away;
JER.49.20	their pasture will be appalled at their fate.
JER.49.21	At the sound of their fall the earth will tremble;
JER.49.21	their cry will resound to the Red Sea.
JER.49.22	Look! An eagle will soar and swoop down,
JER.49.22	spreading its wings over Bozrah.
JER.49.22	In that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors
JER.49.22	will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
JER.49.23	Concerning Damascus:
JER.49.23	“Hamath and Arpad are dismayed,
JER.49.23	for they have heard bad news.
JER.49.23	They are disheartened,
JER.49.23	troubled like
JER.49.24	Damascus has become feeble,
JER.49.24	she has turned to flee
JER.49.24	and panic has gripped her;
JER.49.24	anguish and pain have seized her,
JER.49.24	pain like that of a woman in labor.
JER.49.25	Why has the city of renown not been abandoned,
JER.49.25	the town in which I delight?
JER.49.26	Surely, her young men will fall in the streets;
JER.49.26	all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,”
JER.49.26	declares the 
JER.49.27	“I will set fire to the walls of Damascus;
JER.49.27	it will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad.”
JER.49.28	Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked:
JER.49.28	This is what the 
JER.49.28	“Arise, and attack Kedar
JER.49.28	and destroy the people of the East.
JER.49.29	Their tents and their flocks will be taken;
JER.49.29	their shelters will be carried off
JER.49.29	with all their goods and camels.
JER.49.29	People will shout to them,

JER.49.31	declares the 
JER.49.31	“a nation that has neither gates nor bars;
JER.49.31	its people live far from danger.
JER.49.32	Their camels will become plunder,
JER.49.32	and their large herds will be spoils of war.

JER.49.36	from the four quarters of heaven;
JER.49.36	I will scatter them to the four winds,
JER.49.36	and there will not be a nation
JER.49.36	where Elam’s exiles do not go.
JER.49.37	I will shatter Elam before their foes,
JER.49.37	before those who want to kill them;
JER.49.37	I will bring disaster on them,

JER.49.37	“I will pursue them with the sword
JER.49.37	until I have made an end of them.
JER.49.38	I will set my throne in Elam
JER.49.38	and destroy her king and officials,”

JER.50.3	A nation from the north will attack her
JER.50.3	and lay waste her land.
JER.50.3	No one will live in it;
JER.50.3	both people and animals will flee away.
JER.50.4	“In those days, at that time,”
JER.50.4	declares the 
JER.50.4	“the people of Israel and the people of Judah together
JER.50.4	will go in tears to seek the

JER.50.6	“My people have been lost sheep;
JER.50.6	their shepherds have led them astray
JER.50.6	and caused them to roam on the mountains.
JER.50.6	They wandered over mountain and hill
JER.50.6	and forgot their own resting place.
JER.50.7	Whoever found them devoured them;
JER.50.7	their enemies said, ‘We are not guilty,

JER.50.9	They will take up their positions against her,
JER.50.9	and from the north she will be captured.
JER.50.9	Their arrows will be like skilled warriors
JER.50.9	who do not return empty-handed.
JER.50.10	So Babylonia
JER.50.10	all who plunder her will have their fill,”
JER.50.10	declares the 
JER.50.11	“Because you rejoice and are glad,
JER.50.11	you who pillage my inheritance,
JER.50.11	because you frolic like a heifer threshing grain
JER.50.11	and neigh like stallions,

JER.50.12	she who gave you birth will be disgraced.
JER.50.12	She will be the least of the nations—
JER.50.12	a wilderness, a dry land, a desert.
JER.50.13	Because of the 
JER.50.13	but will be completely desolate.
JER.50.13	All who pass Babylon will be appalled;
JER.50.13	they will scoff because of all her wounds.
JER.50.14	“Take up your positions around Babylon,
JER.50.14	all you who draw the bow.
JER.50.14	Shoot at her! Spare no arrows,
JER.50.14	for she has sinned against the

JER.50.17	“Israel is a scattered flock
JER.50.17	that lions have chased away.

JER.50.17	was the king of Assyria;
JER.50.17	the last to crush their bones
JER.50.17	was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.”
JER.50.18	Therefore this is what the 
JER.50.18	“I will punish the king of Babylon and his land
JER.50.18	as I punished the king of Assyria.
JER.50.19	But I will bring Israel back to their own pasture,
JER.50.19	and they will graze on Carmel and Bashan;
JER.50.19	their appetite will be satisfied
JER.50.19	on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.

JER.50.22	The noise of battle is in the land,
JER.50.22	the noise of great destruction!
JER.50.23	How broken and shattered
JER.50.23	is the hammer of the whole earth!
JER.50.23	How desolate is Babylon
JER.50.23	among the nations!
JER.50.24	I set a trap for you, Babylon,
JER.50.24	and you were caught before you knew it;
JER.50.24	you were found and captured
JER.50.24	because you opposed the 
JER.50.25	The

JER.50.27	Woe to them! For their day has come,
JER.50.27	the time for them to be punished.

JER.50.29	let no one escape.
JER.50.29	Repay her for her deeds;
JER.50.29	do to her as she has done.
JER.50.29	For she has defied the 
JER.50.29	the Holy One of Israel.
JER.50.30	Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets;
JER.50.30	all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,”
JER.50.30	declares the

JER.50.31	declares the Lord, the 
JER.50.31	“for your day has come,
JER.50.31	the time for you to be punished.

JER.50.33	This is what the 
JER.50.33	“The people of Israel are oppressed,
JER.50.33	and the people of Judah as well.
JER.50.33	All their captors hold them fast,
JER.50.33	refusing to let them go.

JER.50.34	but unrest to those who live in Babylon.
JER.50.35	“A sword against the Babylonians!”
JER.50.35	declares the 
JER.50.35	“against those who live in Babylon
JER.50.35	and against her officials and wise men!
JER.50.36	A sword against her false prophets!
JER.50.36	They will become fools.

JER.50.36	They will be filled with terror.
JER.50.37	A sword against her horses and chariots
JER.50.37	and all the foreigners in her ranks!
JER.50.37	They will become weaklings.
JER.50.37	A sword against her treasures!
JER.50.37	They will be plundered.
JER.50.38	A drought on

JER.50.39	or lived in from generation to generation.
JER.50.40	As I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah

JER.50.42	as they ride on their horses;
JER.50.42	they come like men in battle formation
JER.50.42	to attack you, Daughter Babylon.
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon has heard reports about them,
JER.50.43	and his hands hang limp.
JER.50.43	Anguish has gripped him,
JER.50.43	pain like that of a woman in labor.
JER.50.44	Like a lion coming up from Jordan’s thickets
JER.50.44	to a rich pastureland,
JER.50.44	I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant.
JER.50.44	Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this?
JER.50.44	Who is like me and who can challenge me?
JER.50.44	And what shepherd can stand against me?”
JER.50.45	Therefore, hear what the 
JER.50.45	what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians:
JER.50.45	The young of the flock will be dragged away;
JER.50.45	their pasture will be appalled at their fate.
JER.50.46	At the sound of Babylon’s capture the earth will tremble;
JER.50.46	its cry will resound among the nations.

JER.51.1	“See, I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer
JER.51.1	against Babylon and the people of Leb Kamai.
JER.51.2	I will send foreigners to Babylon
JER.51.2	to winnow her and to devastate her land;
JER.51.2	they will oppose her on every side

JER.51.3	nor let him put on his armor.
JER.51.3	Do not spare her young men;

JER.51.7	she made the whole earth drunk.
JER.51.7	The nations drank her wine;

JER.51.58	the nations’ labor is only fuel for the flames.”
JER.51.59	This is the message Jeremiah the prophet gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign. 
JER.51.60	Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon—all that had been recorded concerning Babylon. 
JER.51.61	He said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud. 
JER.51.62	Then say, ‘
JER.51.63	When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates. 
JER.51.64	Then say, ‘So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring on her. And her people will fall.’ ”
JER.51.64	The words of Jeremiah end here.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. 
JER.52.2	He did evil in the eyes of the 
JER.52.3	It was because of the 
JER.52.3	Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
JER.52.4	So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it. 
JER.52.5	The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
JER.52.6	By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat. 
JER.52.7	Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the Babylonians
JER.52.8	but the Babylonian
JER.52.9	and he was captured.
JER.52.9	He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him. 
JER.52.10	There at Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah. 
JER.52.11	Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death.
JER.52.12	On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. 
JER.52.13	He set fire to the temple of the 
JER.52.14	The whole Babylonian army, under the commander of the imperial guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. 
JER.52.15	Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city, along with the rest of the craftsmen
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
JER.52.17	The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the 
JER.52.18	They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service. 
JER.52.19	The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes and bowls used for drink offerings—all that were made of pure gold or silver.
JER.52.20	The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the 
JER.52.21	Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference
JER.52.22	The bronze capital on top of one pillar was five cubits
JER.52.23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding network was a hundred.
JER.52.24	The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers. 
JER.52.25	Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and seven royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land, sixty of whom were found in the city. 
JER.52.26	Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
JER.52.27	There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed.
JER.52.27	So Judah went into captivity, away from her land. 
JER.52.28	This is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile:
JER.52.28	in the seventh year,
JER.52.28	3,023 Jews;
JER.52.29	in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year,
JER.52.29	832 people from Jerusalem;
JER.52.30	in his twenty-third year,
JER.52.30	745 Jews taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard.
JER.52.30	There were 4,600 people in all.
JER.52.31	In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah and freed him from prison. 
JER.52.32	He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 
JER.52.33	So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king’s table. 
JER.52.34	Day by day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived, till the day of his death.
LAM.1.1	How deserted lies the city,
LAM.1.1	once so full of people!
LAM.1.1	How like a widow is she,
LAM.1.1	who once was great among the nations!
LAM.1.1	She who was queen among the provinces
LAM.1.1	has now become a slave.
LAM.1.2	Bitterly she weeps at night,
LAM.1.2	tears are on her cheeks.
LAM.1.2	Among all her lovers
LAM.1.2	there is no one to comfort her.
LAM.1.2	All her friends have betrayed her;
LAM.1.2	they have become her enemies.
LAM.1.3	After affliction and harsh labor,
LAM.1.3	Judah has gone into exile.
LAM.1.3	She dwells among the nations;
LAM.1.3	she finds no resting place.
LAM.1.3	All who pursue her have overtaken her
LAM.1.3	in the midst of her distress.
LAM.1.4	The roads to Zion mourn,
LAM.1.4	for no one comes to her appointed festivals.
LAM.1.4	All her gateways are desolate,
LAM.1.4	her priests groan,
LAM.1.4	her young women grieve,
LAM.1.4	and she is in bitter anguish.
LAM.1.5	Her foes have become her masters;
LAM.1.5	her enemies are at ease.
LAM.1.5	The 
LAM.1.5	because of her many sins.
LAM.1.5	Her children have gone into exile,
LAM.1.5	captive before the foe.
LAM.1.6	All the splendor has departed
LAM.1.6	from Daughter Zion.
LAM.1.6	Her princes are like deer
LAM.1.6	that find no pasture;
LAM.1.6	in weakness they have fled
LAM.1.6	before the pursuer.
LAM.1.7	In the days of her affliction and wandering
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembers all the treasures
LAM.1.7	that were hers in days of old.
LAM.1.7	When her people fell into enemy hands,
LAM.1.7	there was no one to help her.
LAM.1.7	Her enemies looked at her
LAM.1.7	and laughed at her destruction.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem has sinned greatly
LAM.1.8	and so has become unclean.
LAM.1.8	All who honored her despise her,
LAM.1.8	for they have all seen her naked;
LAM.1.8	she herself groans
LAM.1.8	and turns away.
LAM.1.9	Her filthiness clung to her skirts;
LAM.1.9	she did not consider her future.
LAM.1.9	Her fall was astounding;
LAM.1.9	there was none to comfort her.
LAM.1.9	“Look, 
LAM.1.9	for the enemy has triumphed.”
LAM.1.10	The enemy laid hands
LAM.1.10	on all her treasures;
LAM.1.10	she saw pagan nations
LAM.1.10	enter her sanctuary—
LAM.1.10	those you had forbidden
LAM.1.10	to enter your assembly.
LAM.1.11	All her people groan
LAM.1.11	as they search for bread;
LAM.1.11	they barter their treasures for food
LAM.1.11	to keep themselves alive.
LAM.1.11	“Look, 
LAM.1.11	for I am despised.”
LAM.1.12	“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?
LAM.1.12	Look around and see.
LAM.1.12	Is any suffering like my suffering
LAM.1.12	that was inflicted on me,
LAM.1.12	that the 
LAM.1.12	in the day of his fierce anger?
LAM.1.13	“From on high he sent fire,
LAM.1.13	sent it down into my bones.
LAM.1.13	He spread a net for my feet
LAM.1.13	and turned me back.
LAM.1.13	He made me desolate,
LAM.1.13	faint all the day long.
LAM.1.14	“My sins have been bound into a yoke
LAM.1.14	by his hands they were woven together.
LAM.1.14	They have been hung on my neck,
LAM.1.14	and the Lord has sapped my strength.
LAM.1.14	He has given me into the hands
LAM.1.14	of those I cannot withstand.
LAM.1.15	“The Lord has rejected
LAM.1.15	all the warriors in my midst;
LAM.1.15	he has summoned an army against me
LAM.1.15	to
LAM.1.15	In his winepress the Lord has trampled
LAM.1.15	Virgin Daughter Judah.
LAM.1.16	“This is why I weep
LAM.1.16	and my eyes overflow with tears.
LAM.1.16	No one is near to comfort me,
LAM.1.16	no one to restore my spirit.
LAM.1.16	My children are destitute
LAM.1.16	because the enemy has prevailed.”
LAM.1.17	Zion stretches out her hands,
LAM.1.17	but there is no one to comfort her.
LAM.1.17	The 
LAM.1.17	that his neighbors become his foes;
LAM.1.17	Jerusalem has become
LAM.1.17	an unclean thing among them.
LAM.1.18	“The 
LAM.1.18	yet I rebelled against his command.
LAM.1.18	Listen, all you peoples;
LAM.1.18	look on my suffering.
LAM.1.18	My young men and young women
LAM.1.18	have gone into exile.
LAM.1.19	“I called to my allies
LAM.1.19	but they betrayed me.
LAM.1.19	My priests and my elders
LAM.1.19	perished in the city
LAM.1.19	while they searched for food
LAM.1.19	to keep themselves alive.
LAM.1.20	“See, 
LAM.1.20	I am in torment within,
LAM.1.20	and in my heart I am disturbed,
LAM.1.20	for I have been most rebellious.
LAM.1.20	Outside, the sword bereaves;
LAM.1.20	inside, there is only death.
LAM.1.21	“People have heard my groaning,
LAM.1.21	but there is no one to comfort me.
LAM.1.21	All my enemies have heard of my distress;
LAM.1.21	they rejoice at what you have done.
LAM.1.21	May you bring the day you have announced
LAM.1.21	so they may become like me.
LAM.1.22	“Let all their wickedness come before you;
LAM.1.22	deal with them
LAM.1.22	as you have dealt with me
LAM.1.22	because of all my sins.
LAM.1.22	My groans are many
LAM.1.22	and my heart is faint.”
LAM.2.1	How the Lord has covered Daughter Zion
LAM.2.1	with the cloud of his anger
LAM.2.1	He has hurled down the splendor of Israel
LAM.2.1	from heaven to earth;
LAM.2.1	he has not remembered his footstool
LAM.2.1	in the day of his anger.
LAM.2.2	Without pity the Lord has swallowed up
LAM.2.2	all the dwellings of Jacob;
LAM.2.2	in his wrath he has torn down
LAM.2.2	the strongholds of Daughter Judah.
LAM.2.2	He has brought her kingdom and its princes
LAM.2.2	down to the ground in dishonor.
LAM.2.3	In fierce anger he has cut off
LAM.2.3	every horn
LAM.2.3	He has withdrawn his right hand
LAM.2.3	at the approach of the enemy.
LAM.2.3	He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire
LAM.2.3	that consumes everything around it.
LAM.2.4	Like an enemy he has strung his bow;
LAM.2.4	his right hand is ready.
LAM.2.4	Like a foe he has slain
LAM.2.4	all who were pleasing to the eye;
LAM.2.4	he has poured out his wrath like fire
LAM.2.4	on the tent of Daughter Zion.
LAM.2.5	The Lord is like an enemy;
LAM.2.5	he has swallowed up Israel.
LAM.2.5	He has swallowed up all her palaces
LAM.2.5	and destroyed her strongholds.
LAM.2.5	He has multiplied mourning and lamentation
LAM.2.5	for Daughter Judah.
LAM.2.6	He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden;
LAM.2.6	he has destroyed his place of meeting.
LAM.2.6	The 
LAM.2.6	her appointed festivals and her Sabbaths;
LAM.2.6	in his fierce anger he has spurned
LAM.2.6	both king and priest.
LAM.2.7	The Lord has rejected his altar
LAM.2.7	and abandoned his sanctuary.
LAM.2.7	He has given the walls of her palaces
LAM.2.7	into the hands of the enemy;
LAM.2.7	they have raised a shout in the house of the 
LAM.2.7	as on the day of an appointed festival.
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.8	the wall around Daughter Zion.
LAM.2.8	He stretched out a measuring line
LAM.2.8	and did not withhold his hand from destroying.
LAM.2.8	He made ramparts and walls lament;
LAM.2.8	together they wasted away.
LAM.2.9	Her gates have sunk into the ground;
LAM.2.9	their bars he has broken and destroyed.
LAM.2.9	Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations,
LAM.2.9	the law is no more,
LAM.2.9	and her prophets no longer find
LAM.2.9	visions from the 
LAM.2.10	The elders of Daughter Zion
LAM.2.10	sit on the ground in silence;
LAM.2.10	they have sprinkled dust on their heads
LAM.2.10	and put on sackcloth.
LAM.2.10	The young women of Jerusalem
LAM.2.10	have bowed their heads to the ground.
LAM.2.11	My eyes fail from weeping,
LAM.2.11	I am in torment within;
LAM.2.11	my heart is poured out on the ground
LAM.2.11	because my people are destroyed,
LAM.2.11	because children and infants faint
LAM.2.11	in the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	They say to their mothers,
LAM.2.12	“Where is bread and wine?”
LAM.2.12	as they faint like the wounded
LAM.2.12	in the streets of the city,
LAM.2.12	as their lives ebb away
LAM.2.12	in their mothers’ arms.
LAM.2.13	What can I say for you?
LAM.2.13	With what can I compare you,
LAM.2.13	Daughter Jerusalem?
LAM.2.13	To what can I liken you,
LAM.2.13	that I may comfort you,
LAM.2.13	Virgin Daughter Zion?
LAM.2.13	Your wound is as deep as the sea.
LAM.2.13	Who can heal you?
LAM.2.14	The visions of your prophets
LAM.2.14	were false and worthless;
LAM.2.14	they did not expose your sin
LAM.2.14	to ward off your captivity.
LAM.2.14	The prophecies they gave you
LAM.2.14	were false and misleading.
LAM.2.15	All who pass your way
LAM.2.15	clap their hands at you;
LAM.2.15	they scoff and shake their heads
LAM.2.15	at Daughter Jerusalem:
LAM.2.15	“Is this the city that was called
LAM.2.15	the perfection of beauty,
LAM.2.15	the joy of the whole earth?”
LAM.2.16	All your enemies open their mouths
LAM.2.16	wide against you;
LAM.2.16	they scoff and gnash their teeth
LAM.2.16	and say, “We have swallowed her up.
LAM.2.16	This is the day we have waited for;
LAM.2.16	we have lived to see it.”
LAM.2.17	The 
LAM.2.17	he has fulfilled his word,
LAM.2.17	which he decreed long ago.
LAM.2.17	He has overthrown you without pity,
LAM.2.17	he has let the enemy gloat over you,
LAM.2.17	he has exalted the horn
LAM.2.18	The hearts of the people
LAM.2.18	cry out to the Lord.
LAM.2.18	You walls of Daughter Zion,
LAM.2.18	let your tears flow like a river
LAM.2.18	day and night;
LAM.2.18	give yourself no relief,
LAM.2.18	your eyes no rest.
LAM.2.19	Arise, cry out in the night,
LAM.2.19	as the watches of the night begin;
LAM.2.19	pour out your heart like water
LAM.2.19	in the presence of the Lord.
LAM.2.19	Lift up your hands to him
LAM.2.19	for the lives of your children,
LAM.2.19	who faint from hunger
LAM.2.19	at every street corner.
LAM.2.20	“Look, 
LAM.2.20	Whom have you ever treated like this?
LAM.2.20	Should women eat their offspring,
LAM.2.20	the children they have cared for?
LAM.2.20	Should priest and prophet be killed
LAM.2.20	in the sanctuary of the Lord?
LAM.2.21	“Young and old lie together
LAM.2.21	in the dust of the streets;
LAM.2.21	my young men and young women
LAM.2.21	have fallen by the sword.
LAM.2.21	You have slain them in the day of your anger;
LAM.2.21	you have slaughtered them without pity.
LAM.2.22	“As you summon to a feast day,
LAM.2.22	so you summoned against me terrors on every side.
LAM.2.22	In the day of the 
LAM.2.22	no one escaped or survived;
LAM.2.22	those I cared for and reared
LAM.2.22	my enemy has destroyed.”
LAM.3.1	I am the man who has seen affliction
LAM.3.1	by the rod of the 
LAM.3.2	He has driven me away and made me walk
LAM.3.2	in darkness rather than light;
LAM.3.3	indeed, he has turned his hand against me
LAM.3.3	again and again, all day long.
LAM.3.4	He has made my skin and my flesh grow old
LAM.3.4	and has broken my bones.
LAM.3.5	He has besieged me and surrounded me
LAM.3.5	with bitterness and hardship.
LAM.3.6	He has made me dwell in darkness
LAM.3.6	like those long dead.
LAM.3.7	He has walled me in so I cannot escape;
LAM.3.7	he has weighed me down with chains.
LAM.3.8	Even when I call out or cry for help,
LAM.3.8	he shuts out my prayer.
LAM.3.9	He has barred my way with blocks of stone;
LAM.3.9	he has made my paths crooked.
LAM.3.10	Like a bear lying in wait,
LAM.3.10	like a lion in hiding,
LAM.3.11	he dragged me from the path and mangled me
LAM.3.11	and left me without help.
LAM.3.12	He drew his bow
LAM.3.12	and made me the target for his arrows.
LAM.3.13	He pierced my heart
LAM.3.13	with arrows from his quiver.
LAM.3.14	I became the laughingstock of all my people;
LAM.3.14	they mock me in song all day long.
LAM.3.15	He has filled me with bitter herbs
LAM.3.15	and given me gall to drink.
LAM.3.16	He has broken my teeth with gravel;
LAM.3.16	he has trampled me in the dust.
LAM.3.17	I have been deprived of peace;
LAM.3.17	I have forgotten what prosperity is.
LAM.3.18	So I say, “My splendor is gone
LAM.3.18	and all that I had hoped from the 
LAM.3.19	I remember my affliction and my wandering,
LAM.3.19	the bitterness and the gall.
LAM.3.20	I well remember them,
LAM.3.20	and my soul is downcast within me.
LAM.3.21	Yet this I call to mind
LAM.3.21	and therefore I have hope:
LAM.3.22	Because of the 
LAM.3.22	for his compassions never fail.
LAM.3.23	They are new every morning;
LAM.3.23	great is your faithfulness.
LAM.3.24	I say to myself, “The 
LAM.3.24	therefore I will wait for him.”
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.25	to the one who seeks him;
LAM.3.26	it is good to wait quietly
LAM.3.26	for the salvation of the 
LAM.3.27	It is good for a man to bear the yoke
LAM.3.27	while he is young.
LAM.3.28	Let him sit alone in silence,
LAM.3.28	for the 
LAM.3.29	Let him bury his face in the dust—
LAM.3.29	there may yet be hope.
LAM.3.30	Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him,
LAM.3.30	and let him be filled with disgrace.
LAM.3.31	For no one is cast off
LAM.3.31	by the Lord forever.
LAM.3.32	Though he brings grief, he will show compassion,
LAM.3.32	so great is his unfailing love.
LAM.3.33	For he does not willingly bring affliction
LAM.3.33	or grief to anyone.
LAM.3.34	To crush underfoot
LAM.3.34	all prisoners in the land,
LAM.3.35	to deny people their rights
LAM.3.35	before the Most High,
LAM.3.36	to deprive them of justice—
LAM.3.36	would not the Lord see such things?
LAM.3.37	Who can speak and have it happen
LAM.3.37	if the Lord has not decreed it?
LAM.3.38	Is it not from the mouth of the Most High
LAM.3.38	that both calamities and good things come?
LAM.3.39	Why should the living complain
LAM.3.39	when punished for their sins?
LAM.3.40	Let us examine our ways and test them,
LAM.3.40	and let us return to the 
LAM.3.41	Let us lift up our hearts and our hands
LAM.3.41	to God in heaven, and say:
LAM.3.42	“We have sinned and rebelled
LAM.3.42	and you have not forgiven.
LAM.3.43	“You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us;
LAM.3.43	you have slain without pity.
LAM.3.44	You have covered yourself with a cloud
LAM.3.44	so that no prayer can get through.
LAM.3.45	You have made us scum and refuse
LAM.3.45	among the nations.
LAM.3.46	“All our enemies have opened their mouths
LAM.3.46	wide against us.
LAM.3.47	We have suffered terror and pitfalls,
LAM.3.47	ruin and destruction.”
LAM.3.48	Streams of tears flow from my eyes
LAM.3.48	because my people are destroyed.
LAM.3.49	My eyes will flow unceasingly,
LAM.3.49	without relief,
LAM.3.50	until the 
LAM.3.50	from heaven and sees.
LAM.3.51	What I see brings grief to my soul
LAM.3.51	because of all the women of my city.
LAM.3.52	Those who were my enemies without cause
LAM.3.52	hunted me like a bird.
LAM.3.53	They tried to end my life in a pit
LAM.3.53	and threw stones at me;
LAM.3.54	the waters closed over my head,
LAM.3.54	and I thought I was about to perish.
LAM.3.55	I called on your name, 
LAM.3.55	from the depths of the pit.
LAM.3.56	You heard my plea: “Do not close your ears
LAM.3.56	to my cry for relief.”
LAM.3.57	You came near when I called you,
LAM.3.57	and you said, “Do not fear.”
LAM.3.58	You, Lord, took up my case;
LAM.3.58	you redeemed my life.
LAM.3.59	Uphold my cause!
LAM.3.60	You have seen the depth of their vengeance,
LAM.3.60	all their plots against me.
LAM.3.61	all their plots against me—
LAM.3.62	what my enemies whisper and mutter
LAM.3.62	against me all day long.
LAM.3.63	Look at them! Sitting or standing,
LAM.3.63	they mock me in their songs.
LAM.3.64	Pay them back what they deserve, 
LAM.3.64	for what their hands have done.
LAM.3.65	Put a veil over their hearts,
LAM.3.65	and may your curse be on them!
LAM.3.66	Pursue them in anger and destroy them
LAM.3.66	from under the heavens of the 
LAM.4.1	How the gold has lost its luster,
LAM.4.1	the fine gold become dull!
LAM.4.1	The sacred gems are scattered
LAM.4.1	at every street corner.
LAM.4.2	How the precious children of Zion,
LAM.4.2	once worth their weight in gold,
LAM.4.2	are now considered as pots of clay,
LAM.4.2	the work of a potter’s hands!
LAM.4.3	Even jackals offer their breasts
LAM.4.3	to nurse their young,
LAM.4.3	but my people have become heartless
LAM.4.3	like ostriches in the desert.
LAM.4.4	Because of thirst the infant’s tongue
LAM.4.4	sticks to the roof of its mouth;
LAM.4.4	the children beg for bread,
LAM.4.4	but no one gives it to them.
LAM.4.5	Those who once ate delicacies
LAM.4.5	are destitute in the streets.
LAM.4.5	Those brought up in royal purple
LAM.4.5	now lie on ash heaps.
LAM.4.6	The punishment of my people
LAM.4.6	is greater than that of Sodom,
LAM.4.6	which was overthrown in a moment
LAM.4.6	without a hand turned to help her.
LAM.4.7	Their princes were brighter than snow
LAM.4.7	and whiter than milk,
LAM.4.7	their bodies more ruddy than rubies,
LAM.4.7	their appearance like lapis lazuli.
LAM.4.8	But now they are blacker than soot;

LAM.4.9	than those who die of famine;
LAM.4.9	racked with hunger, they waste away

LAM.4.12	nor did any of the peoples of the world,
LAM.4.12	that enemies and foes could enter
LAM.4.12	the gates of Jerusalem.
LAM.4.13	But it happened because of the sins of her prophets
LAM.4.13	and the iniquities of her priests,
LAM.4.13	who shed within her
LAM.4.13	the blood of the righteous.
LAM.4.14	Now they grope through the streets
LAM.4.14	as if they were blind.
LAM.4.14	They are so defiled with blood
LAM.4.14	that no one dares to touch their garments.

LAM.4.17	Moreover, our eyes failed,
LAM.4.17	looking in vain for help;
LAM.4.17	from our towers we watched
LAM.4.17	for a nation that could not save us.
LAM.4.18	People stalked us at every step,
LAM.4.18	so we could not walk in our streets.
LAM.4.18	Our end was near, our days were numbered,
LAM.4.18	for our end had come.
LAM.4.19	Our pursuers were swifter
LAM.4.19	than eagles in the sky;
LAM.4.19	they chased us over the mountains
LAM.4.19	and lay in wait for us in the desert.

LAM.4.21	you who live in the land of Uz.

LAM.4.21	you will be drunk and stripped naked.
LAM.4.22	Your punishment will end, Daughter Zion;
LAM.4.22	he will not prolong your exile.
LAM.4.22	But he will punish your sin, Daughter Edom,
LAM.4.22	and expose your wickedness.
LAM.5.1	Remember, 
LAM.5.1	look, and see our disgrace.
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
LAM.5.2	our homes to foreigners.
LAM.5.3	We have become fatherless,
LAM.5.3	our mothers are widows.
LAM.5.4	We must buy the water we drink;
LAM.5.4	our wood can be had only at a price.
LAM.5.5	Those who pursue us are at our heels;
LAM.5.5	we are weary and find no rest.
LAM.5.6	We submitted to Egypt and Assyria
LAM.5.6	to get enough bread.
LAM.5.7	Our ancestors sinned and are no more,
LAM.5.7	and we bear their punishment.
LAM.5.8	Slaves rule over us,
LAM.5.8	and there is no one to free us from their hands.
LAM.5.9	We get our bread at the risk of our lives
LAM.5.9	because of the sword in the desert.
LAM.5.10	Our skin is hot as an oven,
LAM.5.10	feverish from hunger.
LAM.5.11	Women have been violated in Zion,
LAM.5.11	and virgins in the towns of Judah.
LAM.5.12	Princes have been hung up by their hands;
LAM.5.12	elders are shown no respect.
LAM.5.13	Young men toil at the millstones;
LAM.5.13	boys stagger under loads of wood.
LAM.5.14	The elders are gone from the city gate;
LAM.5.14	the young men have stopped their music.
LAM.5.15	Joy is gone from our hearts;
LAM.5.15	our dancing has turned to mourning.
LAM.5.16	The crown has fallen from our head.
LAM.5.16	Woe to us, for we have sinned!
LAM.5.17	Because of this our hearts are faint,
LAM.5.17	because of these things our eyes grow dim
LAM.5.18	for Mount Zion, which lies desolate,
LAM.5.18	with jackals prowling over it.
LAM.5.19	You, 
LAM.5.19	your throne endures from generation to generation.

LAM.5.20	Why do you forsake us so long?

EZK.1.1	In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.
EZK.1.2	On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— 
EZK.1.3	the word of the 
EZK.1.4	I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, 
EZK.1.5	and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, 
EZK.1.6	but each of them had four faces and four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. 
EZK.1.8	Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, 
EZK.1.9	and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.
EZK.1.10	Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. 
EZK.1.11	Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body. 
EZK.1.12	Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. 
EZK.1.13	The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. 
EZK.1.14	The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.
EZK.1.15	As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. 
EZK.1.16	This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. 
EZK.1.17	As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. 
EZK.1.18	Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.
EZK.1.19	When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. 
EZK.1.20	Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
EZK.1.21	When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
EZK.1.22	Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. 
EZK.1.23	Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. 
EZK.1.24	When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,
EZK.1.25	Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. 
EZK.1.26	Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. 
EZK.1.27	I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. 
EZK.1.28	Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him.
EZK.1.28	This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the 
EZK.2.1	He said to me, “Son of man,
EZK.2.2	As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.
EZK.2.3	He said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day. 
EZK.2.4	The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.2.5	And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them. 
EZK.2.6	And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people. 
EZK.2.7	You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious. 
EZK.2.8	But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you.”
EZK.2.9	Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, 
EZK.2.10	which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe.
EZK.3.1	And he said to me, “Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the people of Israel.” 
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.
EZK.3.3	Then he said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.
EZK.3.4	He then said to me: “Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them. 
EZK.3.5	You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language, but to the people of Israel— 
EZK.3.6	not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. 
EZK.3.7	But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate. 
EZK.3.8	But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are. 
EZK.3.9	I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.”
EZK.3.10	And he said to me, “Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you. 
EZK.3.11	Go now to your people in exile and speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.3.12	Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound as the glory of the 
EZK.3.13	It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. 
EZK.3.14	The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the 
EZK.3.15	I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed.
EZK.3.16	At the end of seven days the word of the 
EZK.3.17	“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. 
EZK.3.18	When I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for
EZK.3.19	But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself.
EZK.3.20	“Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous things that person did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. 
EZK.3.21	But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself.”
EZK.3.22	The hand of the 
EZK.3.23	So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the 
EZK.3.24	Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: “Go, shut yourself inside your house. 
EZK.3.25	And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people. 
EZK.3.26	I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people. 
EZK.3.27	But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.4.1	“Now, son of man, take a block of clay, put it in front of you and draw the city of Jerusalem on it. 
EZK.4.2	Then lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it, set up camps against it and put battering rams around it. 
EZK.4.3	Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the people of Israel.
EZK.4.4	“Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the people of Israel upon yourself.
EZK.4.5	I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the people of Israel.
EZK.4.6	“After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the sin of the people of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year. 
EZK.4.7	Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her. 
EZK.4.8	I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege.
EZK.4.9	“Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side. 
EZK.4.10	Weigh out twenty shekels
EZK.4.11	Also measure out a sixth of a hin
EZK.4.12	Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread; bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel.” 
EZK.4.13	The 
EZK.4.14	Then I said, “Not so, Sovereign 
EZK.4.15	“Very well,” he said, “I will let you bake your bread over cow dung instead of human excrement.”
EZK.4.16	He then said to me: “Son of man, I am about to cut off the food supply in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair, 
EZK.4.17	for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of
EZK.5.1	“Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber’s razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take a set of scales and divide up the hair. 
EZK.5.2	When the days of your siege come to an end, burn a third of the hair inside the city. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. And scatter a third to the wind. For I will pursue them with drawn sword. 
EZK.5.3	But take a few hairs and tuck them away in the folds of your garment. 
EZK.5.4	Again, take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up. A fire will spread from there to all Israel.
EZK.5.5	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.5.6	Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more than the nations and countries around her. She has rejected my laws and has not followed my decrees.
EZK.5.7	“Therefore this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.5.8	“Therefore this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.5.9	Because of all your detestable idols, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again. 
EZK.5.10	Therefore in your midst parents will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all your survivors to the winds. 
EZK.5.11	Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.5.12	A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you; a third will fall by the sword outside your walls; and a third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword.

EZK.5.16	When I shoot at you with my deadly and destructive arrows of famine, I will shoot to destroy you. I will bring more and more famine upon you and cut off your supply of food.

EZK.8.8	He said to me, “Son of man, now dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there.
EZK.8.9	And he said to me, “Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here.” 
EZK.8.10	So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel. 
EZK.8.11	In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.
EZK.8.12	He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, ‘The 
EZK.8.13	Again, he said, “You will see them doing things that are even more detestable.”
EZK.8.14	Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the 
EZK.8.15	He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this.”
EZK.8.16	He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the 
EZK.8.17	He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually arouse my anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose! 
EZK.8.18	Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with pity or spare them. Although they shout in my ears, I will not listen to them.”
EZK.9.1	Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, “Bring near those who are appointed to execute judgment on the city, each with a weapon in his hand.” 
EZK.9.2	And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar.
EZK.9.3	Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the 
EZK.9.4	and said to him, “Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.”
EZK.9.5	As I listened, he said to the others, “Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion. 
EZK.9.6	Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple.
EZK.9.7	Then he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!” So they went out and began killing throughout the city. 
EZK.9.8	While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out, “Alas, Sovereign 
EZK.9.9	He answered me, “The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They say, ‘The 
EZK.9.10	So I will not look on them with pity or spare them, but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done.”
EZK.9.11	Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded.”
EZK.10.1	I looked, and I saw the likeness of a throne of lapis lazuli above the vault that was over the heads of the cherubim. 
EZK.10.2	The 
EZK.10.3	Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. 
EZK.10.4	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.5	The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty
EZK.10.6	When the 
EZK.10.7	Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen, who took it and went out. 
EZK.10.8	(Under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what looked like human hands.)
EZK.10.9	I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels, one beside each of the cherubim; the wheels sparkled like topaz. 
EZK.10.10	As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike; each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel. 
EZK.10.11	As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced; the wheels did not turn about
EZK.10.12	Their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands and their wings, were completely full of eyes, as were their four wheels. 
EZK.10.13	I heard the wheels being called “the whirling wheels.” 
EZK.10.14	Each of the cherubim had four faces: One face was that of a cherub, the second the face of a human being, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
EZK.10.15	Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River. 
EZK.10.16	When the cherubim moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not leave their side. 
EZK.10.17	When the cherubim stood still, they also stood still; and when the cherubim rose, they rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
EZK.10.18	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.19	While I watched, the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground, and as they went, the wheels went with them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the 
EZK.10.20	These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Kebar River, and I realized that they were cherubim. 
EZK.10.21	Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was what looked like human hands. 
EZK.10.22	Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar River. Each one went straight ahead.
EZK.11.1	Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the 
EZK.11.2	The 
EZK.11.3	They say, ‘Haven’t our houses been recently rebuilt? This city is a pot, and we are the meat in it.’ 
EZK.11.4	Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man.”
EZK.11.5	Then the Spirit of the 
EZK.11.6	You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead.
EZK.11.7	“Therefore this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.11.8	You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.11.9	I will drive you out of the city and deliver you into the hands of foreigners and inflict punishment on you. 
EZK.11.10	You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.11.11	This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. 
EZK.11.12	And you will know that I am the 
EZK.11.13	Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, “Alas, Sovereign 
EZK.11.14	The word of the 
EZK.11.15	“Son of man, the people of Jerusalem have said of your fellow exiles and all the other Israelites, ‘They are far away from the 
EZK.11.16	“Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.11.17	“Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.11.18	“They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols. 
EZK.11.19	I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. 
EZK.11.20	Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.11.22	Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. 
EZK.11.23	The glory of the 
EZK.11.24	The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia
EZK.11.24	Then the vision I had seen went up from me, 
EZK.11.25	and I told the exiles everything the 
EZK.12.1	The word of the 
EZK.12.2	“Son of man, you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people.
EZK.12.3	“Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious people. 
EZK.12.4	During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile. 
EZK.12.5	While they watch, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it. 
EZK.12.6	Put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign to the Israelites.”
EZK.12.7	So I did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulders while they watched.
EZK.12.8	In the morning the word of the 
EZK.12.9	“Son of man, did not the Israelites, that rebellious people, ask you, ‘What are you doing?’
EZK.12.10	“Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.12.11	Say to them, ‘I am a sign to you.’
EZK.12.11	“As I have done, so it will be done to them. They will go into exile as captives.
EZK.12.12	“The prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and leave, and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land. 
EZK.12.13	I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die. 
EZK.12.14	I will scatter to the winds all those around him—his staff and all his troops—and I will pursue them with drawn sword.
EZK.12.15	“They will know that I am the 
EZK.12.16	But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine and plague, so that in the nations where they go they may acknowledge all their detestable practices. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.12.17	The word of the 
EZK.12.18	“Son of man, tremble as you eat your food, and shudder in fear as you drink your water. 
EZK.12.19	Say to the people of the land: ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.12.20	The inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.12.21	The word of the 
EZK.12.22	“Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel: ‘The days go by and every vision comes to nothing’? 
EZK.12.23	Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign

EZK.13.11	therefore tell those who cover it with whitewash that it is going to fall. Rain will come in torrents, and I will send hailstones hurtling down, and violent winds will burst forth.

EZK.13.18	and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign

EZK.15.3	Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on? 
EZK.15.4	And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? 
EZK.15.5	If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?
EZK.15.6	“Therefore this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.15.7	I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the 
EZK.15.8	I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign

EZK.16.2	“Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices 
EZK.16.3	and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.16.4	On the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths. 
EZK.16.5	No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised.
EZK.16.6	“ ‘Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, “Live!”
EZK.16.7	I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew and developed and entered puberty. Your breasts had formed and your hair had grown, yet you were stark naked.
EZK.16.8	“ ‘Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your naked body. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.16.9	“ ‘I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. 
EZK.16.10	I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put sandals of fine leather on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments. 
EZK.16.11	I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck, 
EZK.16.12	and I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head. 
EZK.16.13	So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was honey, olive oil and the finest flour. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen. 
EZK.16.14	And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.16.15	“ ‘But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his. 
EZK.16.16	You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. You went to him, and he possessed your beauty.
EZK.16.17	You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them. 
EZK.16.18	And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them. 
EZK.16.19	Also the food I provided for you—the flour, olive oil and honey I gave you to eat—you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.16.20	“ ‘And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough? 
EZK.16.21	You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols. 
EZK.16.22	In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood.
EZK.16.23	“ ‘Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.16.24	you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square. 
EZK.16.25	At every street corner you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, spreading your legs with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by. 
EZK.16.26	You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your neighbors with large genitals, and aroused my anger with your increasing promiscuity. 
EZK.16.27	So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct. 
EZK.16.28	You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied. 
EZK.16.29	Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia,
EZK.16.30	“ ‘I am filled with fury against you,
EZK.16.31	When you built your mounds at every street corner and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you scorned payment.
EZK.16.32	“ ‘You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband! 
EZK.16.33	All prostitutes receive gifts, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors. 
EZK.16.34	So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you.
EZK.16.35	“ ‘Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the 
EZK.16.36	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.16.37	therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will see you stark naked. 
EZK.16.38	I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring on you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger. 
EZK.16.39	Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you stark naked. 
EZK.16.40	They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords. 
EZK.16.41	They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers. 
EZK.16.42	Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry.
EZK.16.43	“ ‘Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things, I will surely bring down on your head what you have done, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.16.44	“ ‘Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: “Like mother, like daughter.” 
EZK.16.45	You are a true daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. 
EZK.16.46	Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom. 
EZK.16.47	You not only followed their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they. 
EZK.16.48	As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.16.49	“ ‘Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. 
EZK.16.50	They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen. 
EZK.16.51	Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done. 
EZK.16.52	Bear your disgrace, for you have furnished some justification for your sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So then, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.
EZK.16.53	“ ‘However, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them, 
EZK.16.54	so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort. 
EZK.16.55	And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to what they were before; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before. 
EZK.16.56	You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride, 
EZK.16.57	before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom
EZK.16.58	You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the 
EZK.16.59	“ ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.16.60	Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. 
EZK.16.61	Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant with you. 
EZK.16.62	So I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the 
EZK.16.63	Then, when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation, declares the Sovereign

EZK.17.14	so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to rise again, surviving only by keeping his treaty. 
EZK.17.15	But the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the treaty and yet escape?

EZK.18.5	who does what is just and right.
EZK.18.6	He does not eat at the mountain shrines
EZK.18.6	or look to the idols of Israel.
EZK.18.6	He does not defile his neighbor’s wife
EZK.18.6	or have sexual relations with a woman during her period.
EZK.18.7	He does not oppress anyone,

EZK.18.9	That man is righteous;

EZK.18.17	He keeps my laws and follows my decrees.
EZK.18.17	He will not die for his father’s sin; he will surely live. 
EZK.18.18	But his father will die for his own sin, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people.
EZK.18.19	“Yet you ask, ‘Why does the son not share the guilt of his father?’ Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees, he will surely live. 
EZK.18.20	The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them.
EZK.18.21	“But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, that person will surely live; they will not die. 
EZK.18.22	None of the offenses they have committed will be remembered against them. Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live.

EZK.18.24	“But if a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked person does, will they live? None of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness they are guilty of and because of the sins they have committed, they will die.
EZK.18.25	“Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Hear, you Israelites: Is my way unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust? 
EZK.18.26	If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin, they will die for it; because of the sin they have committed they will die. 
EZK.18.27	But if a wicked person turns away from the wickedness they have committed and does what is just and right, they will save their life. 
EZK.18.28	Because they consider all the offenses they have committed and turn away from them, that person will surely live; they will not die. 
EZK.18.29	Yet the Israelites say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Are my ways unjust, people of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust?
EZK.18.30	“Therefore, you Israelites, I will judge each of you according to your own ways, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.18.31	Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, people of Israel?

EZK.23.3	They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed. 
EZK.23.4	The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
EZK.23.5	“Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors 
EZK.23.6	clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen. 
EZK.23.7	She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after. 
EZK.23.8	She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her.
EZK.23.9	“Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted. 
EZK.23.10	They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her.
EZK.23.11	“Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister. 
EZK.23.12	She too lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men. 
EZK.23.13	I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way.
EZK.23.14	“But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans
EZK.23.15	with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea.
EZK.23.16	As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. 
EZK.23.17	Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. 
EZK.23.18	When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. 
EZK.23.19	Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. 
EZK.23.20	There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. 
EZK.23.21	So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.
EZK.23.22	“Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses. 
EZK.23.24	They will come against you with weapons,
EZK.23.25	I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire. 
EZK.23.26	They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry. 
EZK.23.27	So I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore.
EZK.23.28	“For this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.29	They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you stark naked, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity 
EZK.23.30	have brought this on you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. 
EZK.23.31	You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand.
EZK.23.32	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.32	“You will drink your sister’s cup,
EZK.23.32	a cup large and deep;
EZK.23.32	it will bring scorn and derision,
EZK.23.32	for it holds so much.
EZK.23.33	You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,
EZK.23.33	the cup of ruin and desolation,
EZK.23.33	the cup of your sister Samaria.
EZK.23.34	You will drink it and drain it dry
EZK.23.34	and chew on its pieces—
EZK.23.34	and you will tear your breasts.
EZK.23.34	I have spoken, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.23.35	“Therefore this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.37	for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them. 
EZK.23.38	They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths. 
EZK.23.39	On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house.
EZK.23.40	“They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them, applied eye makeup and put on your jewelry. 
EZK.23.41	You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and olive oil that belonged to me.
EZK.23.42	“The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; drunkards were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the wrists of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads. 
EZK.23.43	Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, ‘Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.’ 
EZK.23.44	And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah. 
EZK.23.45	But righteous judges will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands.
EZK.23.46	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.47	The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses.
EZK.23.48	“So I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you. 
EZK.23.49	You will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign 
EZK.24.1	In the ninth year, in the tenth month on the tenth day, the word of the 
EZK.24.2	“Son of man, record this date, this very date, because the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. 
EZK.24.3	Tell this rebellious people a parable and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.24.3	“ ‘Put on the cooking pot; put it on
EZK.24.3	and pour water into it.
EZK.24.4	Put into it the pieces of meat,
EZK.24.4	all the choice pieces—the leg and the shoulder.
EZK.24.4	Fill it with the best of these bones;
EZK.24.5	take the pick of the flock.
EZK.24.5	Pile wood beneath it for the bones;
EZK.24.5	bring it to a boil
EZK.24.5	and cook the bones in it.
EZK.24.6	“ ‘For this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.24.6	“ ‘Woe to the city of bloodshed,
EZK.24.6	to the pot now encrusted,
EZK.24.6	whose deposit will not go away!
EZK.24.6	Take the meat out piece by piece
EZK.24.6	in whatever order it comes.
EZK.24.7	“ ‘For the blood she shed is in her midst:
EZK.24.7	She poured it on the bare rock;
EZK.24.7	she did not pour it on the ground,
EZK.24.7	where the dust would cover it.
EZK.24.8	To stir up wrath and take revenge
EZK.24.8	I put her blood on the bare rock,
EZK.24.8	so that it would not be covered.
EZK.24.9	“ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.24.9	“ ‘Woe to the city of bloodshed!
EZK.24.9	I, too, will pile the wood high.
EZK.24.10	So heap on the wood
EZK.24.10	and kindle the fire.
EZK.24.10	Cook the meat well,
EZK.24.10	mixing in the spices;
EZK.24.10	and let the bones be charred.
EZK.24.11	Then set the empty pot on the coals
EZK.24.11	till it becomes hot and its copper glows,
EZK.24.11	so that its impurities may be melted
EZK.24.11	and its deposit burned away.
EZK.24.12	It has frustrated all efforts;
EZK.24.12	its heavy deposit has not been removed,
EZK.24.12	not even by fire.
EZK.24.13	“ ‘Now your impurity is lewdness. Because I tried to cleanse you but you would not be cleansed from your impurity, you will not be clean again until my wrath against you has subsided.
EZK.24.14	“ ‘I the 
EZK.24.15	The word of the 
EZK.24.16	“Son of man, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes. Yet do not lament or weep or shed any tears. 
EZK.24.17	Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Keep your turban fastened and your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners.”
EZK.24.18	So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I had been commanded.
EZK.24.19	Then the people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things have to do with us? Why are you acting like this?”
EZK.24.20	So I said to them, “The word of the 
EZK.24.21	Say to the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.24.22	And you will do as I have done. You will not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners. 
EZK.24.23	You will keep your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep but will waste away because of
EZK.24.24	Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will do just as he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Sovereign 
EZK.24.25	“And you, son of man, on the day I take away their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes, their heart’s desire, and their sons and daughters as well— 
EZK.24.26	on that day a fugitive will come to tell you the news. 
EZK.24.27	At that time your mouth will be opened; you will speak with him and will no longer be silent. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the 
EZK.25.1	The word of the 
EZK.25.2	“Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them. 
EZK.25.3	Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the Sovereign 
EZK.25.4	therefore I am going to give you to the people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk.

EZK.25.9	therefore I will expose the flank of Moab, beginning at its frontier towns—Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and Kiriathaim—the glory of that land. 
EZK.25.10	I will give Moab along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations;

EZK.26.10	His horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust. Your walls will tremble at the noise of the warhorses, wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city whose walls have been broken through. 
EZK.26.11	The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground.

EZK.31.3	its top above the thick foliage.
EZK.31.4	The waters nourished it,

EZK.31.4	all around its base

EZK.31.4	to all the trees of the field.
EZK.31.5	So it towered higher
EZK.31.5	than all the trees of the field;
EZK.31.5	its boughs increased

EZK.31.5	spreading because of abundant waters.
EZK.31.6	All the birds of the sky
EZK.31.6	nested in its boughs,
EZK.31.6	all the animals of the wild

EZK.31.8	compare with its branches—
EZK.31.8	no tree in the garden of God
EZK.31.8	could match its beauty.
EZK.31.9	I made it beautiful
EZK.31.9	with abundant branches,

EZK.31.11	I gave it into the hands of the ruler of the nations, for him to deal with according to its wickedness. I cast it aside,

EZK.31.13	All the birds settled on the fallen tree, and all the wild animals lived among its branches. 
EZK.31.14	Therefore no other trees by the waters are ever to tower proudly on high, lifting their tops above the thick foliage. No other trees so well-watered are ever to reach such a height; they are all destined for death, for the earth below, among mortals who go down to the realm of the dead.

EZK.35.2	“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir; prophesy against it 
EZK.35.3	and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.35.4	I will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.35.5	“ ‘Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached its climax, 
EZK.35.6	therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.35.7	I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go. 
EZK.35.8	I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines. 
EZK.35.9	I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.35.10	“ ‘Because you have said, “These two nations and countries will be ours and we will take possession of them,” even though I the 
EZK.35.11	therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.35.12	Then you will know that I the 
EZK.35.13	You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint, and I heard it. 
EZK.35.14	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.35.15	Because you rejoiced when the inheritance of Israel became desolate, that is how I will treat you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir, you and all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.36.1	“Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the

EZK.36.3	Therefore prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.4	therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign 
EZK.36.5	this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.6	Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.7	Therefore this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.8	“ ‘But you, mountains of Israel, will produce branches and fruit for my people Israel, for they will soon come home. 
EZK.36.9	I am concerned for you and will look on you with favor; you will be plowed and sown, 
EZK.36.10	and I will cause many people to live on you—yes, all of Israel. The towns will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. 
EZK.36.11	I will increase the number of people and animals living on you, and they will be fruitful and become numerous. I will settle people on you as in the past and will make you prosper more than before. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.36.12	I will cause people, my people Israel, to live on you. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance; you will never again deprive them of their children.

EZK.36.14	therefore you will no longer devour people or make your nation childless, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.36.15	No longer will I make you hear the taunts of the nations, and no longer will you suffer the scorn of the peoples or cause your nation to fall, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.36.16	Again the word of the 
EZK.36.17	“Son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own land, they defiled it by their conduct and their actions. Their conduct was like a woman’s monthly uncleanness in my sight. 
EZK.36.18	So I poured out my wrath on them because they had shed blood in the land and because they had defiled it with their idols. 
EZK.36.19	I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered through the countries; I judged them according to their conduct and their actions. 
EZK.36.20	And wherever they went among the nations they profaned my holy name, for it was said of them, ‘These are the 
EZK.36.21	I had concern for my holy name, which the people of Israel profaned among the nations where they had gone.
EZK.36.22	“Therefore say to the Israelites, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.23	I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the

EZK.36.25	I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. 
EZK.36.26	I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 
EZK.36.27	And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 
EZK.36.28	Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God. 
EZK.36.29	I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it plentiful and will not bring famine upon you. 
EZK.36.30	I will increase the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field, so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine. 
EZK.36.31	Then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your sins and detestable practices. 
EZK.36.32	I want you to know that I am not doing this for your sake, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.36.33	“ ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.34	The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through it. 
EZK.36.35	They will say, “This land that was laid waste has become like the garden of Eden; the cities that were lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now fortified and inhabited.” 
EZK.36.36	Then the nations around you that remain will know that I the

EZK.37.2	He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. 
EZK.37.3	He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”
EZK.37.3	I said, “Sovereign 
EZK.37.4	Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones and say to them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the 
EZK.37.5	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.37.6	I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.37.7	So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 
EZK.37.8	I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.
EZK.37.9	Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.37.10	So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet—a vast army.
EZK.37.11	Then he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the people of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.’ 
EZK.37.12	Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign

EZK.37.17	Join them together into one stick so that they will become one in your hand.
EZK.37.18	“When your people ask you, ‘Won’t you tell us what you mean by this?’ 
EZK.37.19	say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.37.20	Hold before their eyes the sticks you have written on 
EZK.37.21	and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.37.22	I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. There will be one king over all of them and they will never again be two nations or be divided into two kingdoms. 
EZK.37.23	They will no longer defile themselves with their idols and vile images or with any of their offenses, for I will save them from all their sinful backsliding,
EZK.37.24	“ ‘My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. They will follow my laws and be careful to keep my decrees.

EZK.37.26	I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them and increase their numbers, and I will put my sanctuary among them forever. 
EZK.37.27	My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
EZK.37.28	Then the nations will know that I the

In future years you will invade a land that has recovered from war, whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and now all of them live in safety. 
EZK.38.9	You and all your troops and the many nations with you will go up, advancing like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land.

EZK.38.11	You will say, “I will invade a land of unwalled villages; I will attack a peaceful and unsuspecting people—all of them living without walls and without gates and bars.

EZK.38.13	Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all her villages

EZK.38.15	You will come from your place in the far north, you and many nations with you, all of them riding on horses, a great horde, a mighty army. 
EZK.38.16	You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. In days to come, Gog, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I am proved holy through you before their eyes.
EZK.38.17	“ ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.38.18	This is what will happen in that day: When Gog attacks the land of Israel, my hot anger will be aroused, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.38.19	In my zeal and fiery wrath I declare that at that time there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. 
EZK.38.20	The fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the beasts of the field, every creature that moves along the ground, and all the people on the face of the earth will tremble at my presence. The mountains will be overturned, the cliffs will crumble and every wall will fall to the ground. 
EZK.38.21	I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.38.22	I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed; I will pour down torrents of rain, hailstones and burning sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him. 
EZK.38.23	And so I will show my greatness and my holiness, and I will make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the

EZK.39.4	On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and to the wild animals. 
EZK.39.5	You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign

EZK.39.10	They will not need to gather wood from the fields or cut it from the forests, because they will use the weapons for fuel. And they will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.39.11	“ ‘On that day I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, in the valley of those who travel east of the Sea. It will block the way of travelers, because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon Gog.
EZK.39.12	“ ‘For seven months the Israelites will be burying them in order to cleanse the land. 
EZK.39.13	All the people of the land will bury them, and the day I display my glory will be a memorable day for them, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.39.14	People will be continually employed in cleansing the land. They will spread out across the land and, along with others, they will bury any bodies that are lying on the ground.
EZK.39.14	“ ‘After the seven months they will carry out a more detailed search. 
EZK.39.15	As they go through the land, anyone who sees a human bone will leave a marker beside it until the gravediggers bury it in the Valley of Hamon Gog,

EZK.39.28	Then they will know that I am the

EZK.40.1	In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city—on that very day the hand of the 
EZK.40.2	In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city. 
EZK.40.3	He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. 
EZK.40.4	The man said to me, “Son of man, look carefully and listen closely and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the people of Israel everything you see.”
EZK.40.5	I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring rod in the man’s hand was six long cubits,
EZK.40.6	Then he went to the east gate. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep. 
EZK.40.7	The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide, and the projecting walls between the alcoves were five cubits
EZK.40.8	Then he measured the portico of the gateway; 
EZK.40.9	it
EZK.40.10	Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; the three had the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements. 
EZK.40.11	Then he measured the width of the entrance of the gateway; it was ten cubits and its length was thirteen cubits.
EZK.40.12	In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square. 
EZK.40.13	Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits
EZK.40.14	He measured along the faces of the projecting walls all around the inside of the gateway—sixty cubits.
EZK.40.15	The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits.
EZK.40.16	The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees.
EZK.40.17	Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were thirty rooms along the pavement. 
EZK.40.18	It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long; this was the lower pavement. 
EZK.40.19	Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits
EZK.40.20	Then he measured the length and width of the north gate, leading into the outer court. 
EZK.40.21	Its alcoves—three on each side—its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.22	Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them. 
EZK.40.23	There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits.
EZK.40.24	Then he led me to the south side and I saw the south gate. He measured its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others. 
EZK.40.25	The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around, like the openings of the others. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.26	Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them; it had palm tree decorations on the faces of the projecting walls on each side. 
EZK.40.27	The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side; it was a hundred cubits.
EZK.40.28	Then he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others. 
EZK.40.29	Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.30	(The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep.) 
EZK.40.31	Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up to it.
EZK.40.32	Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others. 
EZK.40.33	Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.34	Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it.
EZK.40.35	Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same measurements as the others, 
EZK.40.36	as did its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico, and it had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.37	Its portico
EZK.40.38	A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed. 
EZK.40.39	In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings
EZK.40.40	By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the entrance of the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two tables. 
EZK.40.41	So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered. 
EZK.40.42	There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high.
EZK.40.43	And double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth
EZK.40.44	Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two rooms, one
EZK.40.45	He said to me, “The room facing south is for the priests who guard the temple, 
EZK.40.46	and the room facing north is for the priests who guard the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near to the 
EZK.40.47	Then he measured the court: It was square—a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple.
EZK.40.48	He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits
EZK.40.49	The portico was twenty cubits
EZK.41.1	Then the man brought me to the main hall and measured the jambs; the width of the jambs was six cubits
EZK.41.2	The entrance was ten cubits
EZK.41.3	Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits
EZK.41.4	And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the main hall. He said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”
EZK.41.5	Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits
EZK.41.6	The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple. 
EZK.41.7	The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor.
EZK.41.8	I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod, six long cubits. 
EZK.41.9	The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple 
EZK.41.10	and the priests’ rooms was twenty cubits wide all around the temple. 
EZK.41.11	There were entrances to the side rooms from the open area, one on the north and another on the south; and the base adjoining the open area was five cubits wide all around.
EZK.41.12	The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits
EZK.41.13	Then he measured the temple; it was a hundred cubits
EZK.41.14	The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits.
EZK.41.15	Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits.
EZK.41.15	The main hall, the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court, 
EZK.41.16	as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around the three of them—everything beyond and including the threshold was covered with wood. The floor, the wall up to the windows, and the windows were covered. 
EZK.41.17	In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary 
EZK.41.18	were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces: 
EZK.41.19	the face of a human being toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple. 
EZK.41.20	From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the main hall.
EZK.41.21	The main hall had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of the Most Holy Place was similar. 
EZK.41.22	There was a wooden altar three cubits
EZK.41.23	Both the main hall and the Most Holy Place had double doors. 
EZK.41.24	Each door had two leaves—two hinged leaves for each door. 
EZK.41.25	And on the doors of the main hall were carved cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls, and there was a wooden overhang on the front of the portico. 
EZK.41.26	On the sidewalls of the portico were narrow windows with palm trees carved on each side. The side rooms of the temple also had overhangs.
EZK.42.1	Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side. 
EZK.42.2	The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.
EZK.42.3	Both in the section twenty cubits
EZK.42.4	In front of the rooms was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits
EZK.42.5	Now the upper rooms were narrower, for the galleries took more space from them than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building. 
EZK.42.6	The rooms on the top floor had no pillars, as the courts had; so they were smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors. 
EZK.42.7	There was an outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court; it extended in front of the rooms for fifty cubits. 
EZK.42.8	While the row of rooms on the side next to the outer court was fifty cubits long, the row on the side nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long. 
EZK.42.9	The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
EZK.42.10	On the south side
EZK.42.11	with a passageway in front of them. These were like the rooms on the north; they had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the doorways on the north 
EZK.42.12	were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward, by which one enters the rooms.
EZK.42.13	Then he said to me, “The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard are the priests’ rooms, where the priests who approach the 
EZK.42.14	Once the priests enter the holy precincts, they are not to go into the outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people.”
EZK.42.15	When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led me out by the east gate and measured the area all around: 
EZK.42.16	He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred cubits.
EZK.42.17	He measured the north side; it was five hundred cubits
EZK.42.18	He measured the south side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. 
EZK.42.19	Then he turned to the west side and measured; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. 
EZK.42.20	So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common.
EZK.43.1	Then the man brought me to the gate facing east, 
EZK.43.2	and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of rushing waters, and the land was radiant with his glory. 
EZK.43.3	The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when he

EZK.43.5	Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of the 
EZK.43.6	While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple. 
EZK.43.7	He said: “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet. This is where I will live among the Israelites forever. The people of Israel will never again defile my holy name—neither they nor their kings—by their prostitution and the funeral offerings
EZK.43.8	When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger. 
EZK.43.9	Now let them put away from me their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings, and I will live among them forever.
EZK.43.10	“Son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their sins. Let them consider its perfection, 
EZK.43.11	and if they are ashamed of all they have done, make known to them the design of the temple—its arrangement, its exits and entrances—its whole design and all its regulations
EZK.43.12	“This is the law of the temple: All the surrounding area on top of the mountain will be most holy. Such is the law of the temple.
EZK.43.13	“These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits,
EZK.43.14	From the gutter on the ground up to the lower ledge that goes around the altar it is two cubits high, and the ledge is a cubit wide.
EZK.43.15	Above that, the altar hearth is four cubits high, and four horns project upward from the hearth. 
EZK.43.16	The altar hearth is square, twelve cubits
EZK.43.17	The upper ledge also is square, fourteen cubits
EZK.43.18	Then he said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.43.19	You are to give a young bull as a sin offering
EZK.43.20	You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the upper ledge and all around the rim, and so purify the altar and make atonement for it. 
EZK.43.21	You are to take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the designated part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.
EZK.43.22	“On the second day you are to offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering, and the altar is to be purified as it was purified with the bull. 
EZK.43.23	When you have finished purifying it, you are to offer a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect. 
EZK.43.24	You are to offer them before the 
EZK.43.25	“For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering; you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect. 
EZK.43.26	For seven days they are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; thus they will dedicate it. 
EZK.43.27	At the end of these days, from the eighth day on, the priests are to present your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.44.1	Then the man brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, the one facing east, and it was shut. 
EZK.44.2	The 
EZK.44.3	The prince himself is the only one who may sit inside the gateway to eat in the presence of the

EZK.44.7	In addition to all your other detestable practices, you brought foreigners uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my sanctuary, desecrating my temple while you offered me food, fat and blood, and you broke my covenant. 
EZK.44.8	Instead of carrying out your duty in regard to my holy things, you put others in charge of my sanctuary. 
EZK.44.9	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.44.10	“ ‘The Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray and who wandered from me after their idols must bear the consequences of their sin. 
EZK.44.11	They may serve in my sanctuary, having charge of the gates of the temple and serving in it; they may slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices for the people and stand before the people and serve them. 
EZK.44.12	But because they served them in the presence of their idols and made the people of Israel fall into sin, therefore I have sworn with uplifted hand that they must bear the consequences of their sin, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.44.13	They are not to come near to serve me as priests or come near any of my holy things or my most holy offerings; they must bear the shame of their detestable practices. 
EZK.44.14	And I will appoint them to guard the temple for all the work that is to be done in it.
EZK.44.15	“ ‘But the Levitical priests, who are descendants of Zadok and who guarded my sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from me, are to come near to minister before me; they are to stand before me to offer sacrifices of fat and blood, declares the Sovereign 
EZK.44.16	They alone are to enter my sanctuary; they alone are to come near my table to minister before me and serve me as guards.
EZK.44.17	“ ‘When they enter the gates of the inner court, they are to wear linen clothes; they must not wear any woolen garment while ministering at the gates of the inner court or inside the temple. 
EZK.44.18	They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists. They must not wear anything that makes them perspire. 
EZK.44.19	When they go out into the outer court where the people are, they are to take off the clothes they have been ministering in and are to leave them in the sacred rooms, and put on other clothes, so that the people are not consecrated through contact with their garments.
EZK.44.20	“ ‘They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but they are to keep the hair of their heads trimmed. 
EZK.44.21	No priest is to drink wine when he enters the inner court. 
EZK.44.22	They must not marry widows or divorced women; they may marry only virgins of Israelite descent or widows of priests. 
EZK.44.23	They are to teach my people the difference between the holy and the common and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean.
EZK.44.24	“ ‘In any dispute, the priests are to serve as judges and decide it according to my ordinances. They are to keep my laws and my decrees for all my appointed festivals, and they are to keep my Sabbaths holy.
EZK.44.25	“ ‘A priest must not defile himself by going near a dead person; however, if the dead person was his father or mother, son or daughter, brother or unmarried sister, then he may defile himself. 
EZK.44.26	After he is cleansed, he must wait seven days. 
EZK.44.27	On the day he goes into the inner court of the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, he is to offer a sin offering
EZK.44.28	“ ‘I am to be the only inheritance the priests have. You are to give them no possession in Israel; I will be their possession. 
EZK.44.29	They will eat the grain offerings, the sin offerings and the guilt offerings; and everything in Israel devoted
EZK.44.30	The best of all the firstfruits and of all your special gifts will belong to the priests. You are to give them the first portion of your ground meal so that a blessing may rest on your household. 
EZK.44.31	The priests must not eat anything, whether bird or animal, found dead or torn by wild animals.
EZK.45.1	“ ‘When you allot the land as an inheritance, you are to present to the 
EZK.45.2	Of this, a section 500 cubits
EZK.45.3	In the sacred district, measure off a section 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits
EZK.45.4	It will be the sacred portion of the land for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and who draw near to minister before the 
EZK.45.5	An area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide will belong to the Levites, who serve in the temple, as their possession for towns to live in.

EZK.45.7	“ ‘The prince will have the land bordering each side of the area formed by the sacred district and the property of the city. It will extend westward from the west side and eastward from the east side, running lengthwise from the western to the eastern border parallel to one of the tribal portions. 
EZK.45.8	This land will be his possession in Israel. And my princes will no longer oppress my people but will allow the people of Israel to possess the land according to their tribes.
EZK.45.9	“ ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.45.10	You are to use accurate scales, an accurate ephah
EZK.45.11	The ephah and the bath are to be the same size, the bath containing a tenth of a homer and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer is to be the standard measure for both.

EZK.45.16	All the people of the land will be required to give this special offering to the prince in Israel. 
EZK.45.17	It will be the duty of the prince to provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings and drink offerings at the festivals, the New Moons and the Sabbaths—at all the appointed festivals of Israel. He will provide the sin offerings,

EZK.45.19	The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar and on the gateposts of the inner court. 
EZK.45.20	You are to do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance; so you are to make atonement for the temple.
EZK.45.21	“ ‘In the first month on the fourteenth day you are to observe the Passover, a festival lasting seven days, during which you shall eat bread made without yeast. 
EZK.45.22	On that day the prince is to provide a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land. 
EZK.45.23	Every day during the seven days of the festival he is to provide seven bulls and seven rams without defect as a burnt offering to the

EZK.46.2	The prince is to enter from the outside through the portico of the gateway and stand by the gatepost. The priests are to sacrifice his burnt offering and his fellowship offerings. He is to bow down in worship at the threshold of the gateway and then go out, but the gate will not be shut until evening. 
EZK.46.3	On the Sabbaths and New Moons the people of the land are to worship in the presence of the

EZK.46.7	He is to provide as a grain offering one ephah with the bull, one ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wants to give, along with a hin of oil for each ephah. 
EZK.46.8	When the prince enters, he is to go in through the portico of the gateway, and he is to come out the same way.
EZK.46.9	“ ‘When the people of the land come before the

EZK.46.16	“ ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.46.17	If, however, he makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, the servant may keep it until the year of freedom; then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs to his sons only; it is theirs. 
EZK.46.18	The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people, driving them off their property. He is to give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that not one of my people will be separated from their property.’ ”
EZK.46.19	Then the man brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate to the sacred rooms facing north, which belonged to the priests, and showed me a place at the western end. 
EZK.46.20	He said to me, “This is the place where the priests are to cook the guilt offering and the sin offering
EZK.46.21	He then brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners, and I saw in each corner another court. 
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the outer court were enclosed
EZK.46.23	Around the inside of each of the four courts was a ledge of stone, with places for fire built all around under the ledge. 
EZK.46.24	He said to me, “These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple are to cook the sacrifices of the people.”
EZK.47.1	The man brought me back to the entrance to the temple, and I saw water coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar. 
EZK.47.2	He then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and the water was trickling from the south side.
EZK.47.3	As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits
EZK.47.4	He measured off another thousand cubits and led me through water that was knee-deep. He measured off another thousand and led me through water that was up to the waist. 
EZK.47.5	He measured off another thousand, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river that no one could cross. 
EZK.47.6	He asked me, “Son of man, do you see this?”
EZK.47.6	Then he led me back to the bank of the river. 
EZK.47.7	When I arrived there, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the river. 
EZK.47.8	He said to me, “This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah,
EZK.47.9	Swarms of living creatures will live wherever the river flows. There will be large numbers of fish, because this water flows there and makes the salt water fresh; so where the river flows everything will live. 
EZK.47.10	Fishermen will stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds—like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea. 
EZK.47.11	But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt. 
EZK.47.12	Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.”
EZK.47.13	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.47.14	You are to divide it equally among them. Because I swore with uplifted hand to give it to your ancestors, this land will become your inheritance.
EZK.47.15	“This is to be the boundary of the land:
EZK.47.15	“On the north side it will run from the Mediterranean Sea by the Hethlon road past Lebo Hamath to Zedad, 
EZK.47.16	Berothah
EZK.47.17	The boundary will extend from the sea to Hazar Enan,
EZK.47.18	“On the east side the boundary will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the Dead Sea and as far as Tamar.
EZK.47.19	“On the south side it will run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the southern boundary.
EZK.47.20	“On the west side, the Mediterranean Sea will be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo Hamath. This will be the western boundary.
EZK.47.21	“You are to distribute this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	You are to allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners residing among you and who have children. You are to consider them as native-born Israelites; along with you they are to be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.23	In whatever tribe a foreigner resides, there you are to give them their inheritance,” declares the Sovereign 
EZK.48.1	“These are the tribes, listed by name: At the northern frontier, Dan will have one portion; it will follow the Hethlon road to Lebo Hamath; Hazar Enan and the northern border of Damascus next to Hamath will be part of its border from the east side to the west side.
EZK.48.2	“Asher will have one portion; it will border the territory of Dan from east to west.
EZK.48.3	“Naphtali will have one portion; it will border the territory of Asher from east to west.

EZK.48.8	“Bordering the territory of Judah from east to west will be the portion you are to present as a special gift. It will be 25,000 cubits
EZK.48.9	“The special portion you are to offer to the

EZK.48.11	This will be for the consecrated priests, the Zadokites, who were faithful in serving me and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray. 
EZK.48.12	It will be a special gift to them from the sacred portion of the land, a most holy portion, bordering the territory of the Levites.
EZK.48.13	“Alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites will have an allotment 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. Its total length will be 25,000 cubits and its width 10,000 cubits. 
EZK.48.14	They must not sell or exchange any of it. This is the best of the land and must not pass into other hands, because it is holy to the

EZK.48.16	and will have these measurements: the north side 4,500 cubits,
EZK.48.17	The pastureland for the city will be 250 cubits
EZK.48.18	What remains of the area, bordering on the sacred portion and running the length of it, will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side. Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city. 
EZK.48.19	The workers from the city who farm it will come from all the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.48.20	The entire portion will be a square, 25,000 cubits on each side. As a special gift you will set aside the sacred portion, along with the property of the city.
EZK.48.21	“What remains on both sides of the area formed by the sacred portion and the property of the city will belong to the prince. It will extend eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the sacred portion to the eastern border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border. Both these areas running the length of the tribal portions will belong to the prince, and the sacred portion with the temple sanctuary will be in the center of them. 
EZK.48.22	So the property of the Levites and the property of the city will lie in the center of the area that belongs to the prince. The area belonging to the prince will lie between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin.
EZK.48.23	“As for the rest of the tribes: Benjamin will have one portion; it will extend from the east side to the west side.
EZK.48.24	“Simeon will have one portion; it will border the territory of Benjamin from east to west.

EZK.48.29	“This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these will be their portions,” declares the Sovereign 
EZK.48.30	“These will be the exits of the city: Beginning on the north side, which is 4,500 cubits long, 
EZK.48.31	the gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel. The three gates on the north side will be the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah and the gate of Levi.
EZK.48.32	“On the east side, which is 4,500 cubits long, will be three gates: the gate of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin and the gate of Dan.
EZK.48.33	“On the south side, which measures 4,500 cubits, will be three gates: the gate of Simeon, the gate of Issachar and the gate of Zebulun.

DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 
DAN.1.2	And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia
DAN.1.3	Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring into the king’s service some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility— 
DAN.1.4	young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king’s palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians.
DAN.1.5	The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king’s table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king’s service.
DAN.1.6	Among those who were chosen were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 
DAN.1.7	The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.
DAN.1.8	But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way. 
DAN.1.9	Now God had caused the official to show favor and compassion to Daniel, 
DAN.1.10	but the official told Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your
DAN.1.11	Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, 
DAN.1.12	“Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see.” 
DAN.1.14	So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.
DAN.1.15	At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food. 
DAN.1.16	So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.
DAN.1.17	To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.
DAN.1.18	At the end of the time set by the king to bring them into his service, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king’s service. 
DAN.1.20	In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.
DAN.1.21	And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep. 
DAN.2.2	So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers
DAN.2.3	he said to them, “I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means.
DAN.2.4	Then the astrologers answered the king,
DAN.2.5	The king replied to the astrologers, “This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble. 
DAN.2.6	But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.”
DAN.2.7	Once more they replied, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”
DAN.2.8	Then the king answered, “I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided: 
DAN.2.9	If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.”
DAN.2.10	The astrologers answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer. 
DAN.2.11	What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among humans.”
DAN.2.12	This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.13	So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.
DAN.2.14	When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact. 
DAN.2.15	He asked the king’s officer, “Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?” Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. 
DAN.2.16	At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 
DAN.2.18	He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.19	During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven 
DAN.2.20	and said:
DAN.2.20	“Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever;
DAN.2.20	wisdom and power are his.
DAN.2.21	He changes times and seasons;
DAN.2.21	he deposes kings and raises up others.
DAN.2.21	He gives wisdom to the wise
DAN.2.21	and knowledge to the discerning.
DAN.2.22	He reveals deep and hidden things;
DAN.2.22	he knows what lies in darkness,
DAN.2.22	and light dwells with him.
DAN.2.23	I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors:
DAN.2.23	You have given me wisdom and power,
DAN.2.23	you have made known to me what we asked of you,
DAN.2.23	you have made known to us the dream of the king.”
DAN.2.24	Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.”
DAN.2.25	Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.”
DAN.2.26	The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), “Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?”
DAN.2.27	Daniel replied, “No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, 
DAN.2.28	but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these:
DAN.2.29	“As Your Majesty was lying there, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. 
DAN.2.30	As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.
DAN.2.31	“Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. 
DAN.2.32	The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 
DAN.2.33	its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 
DAN.2.34	While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 
DAN.2.35	Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	“This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. 
DAN.2.37	Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; 
DAN.2.38	in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.
DAN.2.39	“After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. 
DAN.2.40	Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. 
DAN.2.41	Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. 
DAN.2.42	As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. 
DAN.2.43	And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.
DAN.2.44	“In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. 
DAN.2.45	This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces.
DAN.2.45	“The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.”
DAN.2.46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. 
DAN.2.47	The king said to Daniel, “Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.”
DAN.2.48	Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men. 
DAN.2.49	Moreover, at Daniel’s request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.
DAN.3.1	King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide,
DAN.3.2	He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up. 
DAN.3.3	So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.
DAN.3.4	Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “Nations and peoples of every language, this is what you are commanded to do: 
DAN.3.5	As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 
DAN.3.6	Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”
DAN.3.7	Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the nations and peoples of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
DAN.3.8	At this time some astrologers
DAN.3.9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever! 
DAN.3.10	Your Majesty has issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold, 
DAN.3.11	and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.12	But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego—who pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.”
DAN.3.13	Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king, 
DAN.3.14	and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up? 
DAN.3.15	Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?”
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to him, “King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. 
DAN.3.17	If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us
DAN.3.18	But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.”
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual 
DAN.3.20	and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.21	So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.22	The king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, 
DAN.3.23	and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.
DAN.3.24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, “Weren’t there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?”
DAN.3.24	They replied, “Certainly, Your Majesty.”
DAN.3.25	He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.”
DAN.3.26	Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!”
DAN.3.26	So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire, 
DAN.3.27	and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.
DAN.3.28	Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king’s command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. 
DAN.3.29	Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.”
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	King Nebuchadnezzar,
DAN.4.1	To the nations and peoples of every language, who live in all the earth:
DAN.4.1	May you prosper greatly!
DAN.4.2	It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.
DAN.4.3	How great are his signs,
DAN.4.3	how mighty his wonders!
DAN.4.3	His kingdom is an eternal kingdom;
DAN.4.3	his dominion endures from generation to generation.
DAN.4.4	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace, contented and prosperous. 
DAN.4.5	I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me. 
DAN.4.6	So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me. 
DAN.4.7	When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers
DAN.4.8	Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)
DAN.4.9	I said, “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me. 
DAN.4.10	These are the visions I saw while lying in bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous. 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth. 
DAN.4.12	Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it the wild animals found shelter, and the birds lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed.
DAN.4.13	“In the visions I saw while lying in bed, I looked, and there before me was a holy one, a messenger,
DAN.4.14	He called in a loud voice: ‘Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches. 
DAN.4.15	But let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in the ground, in the grass of the field.
DAN.4.15	“ ‘Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth. 
DAN.4.16	Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal, till seven times
DAN.4.17	“ ‘The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of people.’
DAN.4.18	“This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
DAN.4.19	Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you.”
DAN.4.19	Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries! 
DAN.4.20	The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth, 
DAN.4.21	with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the wild animals, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds— 
DAN.4.22	Your Majesty, you are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth.
DAN.4.23	“Your Majesty saw a holy one, a messenger, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live with the wild animals, until seven times pass by for him.’
DAN.4.24	“This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king: 
DAN.4.25	You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes. 
DAN.4.26	The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules. 
DAN.4.27	Therefore, Your Majesty, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue.”
DAN.4.28	All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.4.29	Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, 
DAN.4.30	he said, “Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?”
DAN.4.31	Even as the words were on his lips, a voice came from heaven, “This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you. 
DAN.4.32	You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes.”
DAN.4.33	Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like the ox. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.
DAN.4.34	At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever.
DAN.4.34	His dominion is an eternal dominion;
DAN.4.34	his kingdom endures from generation to generation.
DAN.4.35	All the peoples of the earth
DAN.4.35	are regarded as nothing.
DAN.4.35	He does as he pleases
DAN.4.35	with the powers of heaven
DAN.4.35	and the peoples of the earth.
DAN.4.35	No one can hold back his hand
DAN.4.35	or say to him: “What have you done?”
DAN.4.36	At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before. 
DAN.4.37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble.
DAN.5.1	King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them. 
DAN.5.2	While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father
DAN.5.3	So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them. 
DAN.5.4	As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.
DAN.5.5	Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote. 
DAN.5.6	His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking.
DAN.5.7	The king summoned the enchanters, astrologers
DAN.5.8	Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant. 
DAN.5.9	So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.
DAN.5.10	The queen,
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners. 
DAN.5.12	He did this because Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.”
DAN.5.13	So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah? 
DAN.5.14	I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom. 
DAN.5.15	The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it. 
DAN.5.16	Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.
DAN.5.18	“Your Majesty, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor. 
DAN.5.19	Because of the high position he gave him, all the nations and peoples of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled. 
DAN.5.20	But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory. 
DAN.5.21	He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like the ox; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and sets over them anyone he wishes.
DAN.5.22	“But you, Belshazzar, his son,
DAN.5.23	Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways. 
DAN.5.24	Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.
DAN.5.25	“This is the inscription that was written:
DAN.5.25	mene, mene, tekel, parsin
DAN.5.26	“Here is what these words mean:
DAN.5.29	Then at Belshazzar’s command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.30	That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians,
DAN.5.31	and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.
DAN.6.1	It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom, 
DAN.6.2	with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss. 
DAN.6.3	Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. 
DAN.6.4	At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. 
DAN.6.5	Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.”
DAN.6.6	So these administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said: “May King Darius live forever! 
DAN.6.7	The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next thirty days, except to you, Your Majesty, shall be thrown into the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.8	Now, Your Majesty, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.” 
DAN.6.9	So King Darius put the decree in writing.
DAN.6.10	Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before. 
DAN.6.11	Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. 
DAN.6.12	So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions’ den?”
DAN.6.12	The king answered, “The decree stands—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”
DAN.6.13	Then they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, Your Majesty, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.” 
DAN.6.14	When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.
DAN.6.15	Then the men went as a group to King Darius and said to him, “Remember, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.”
DAN.6.16	So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!”
DAN.6.17	A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel’s situation might not be changed. 
DAN.6.18	Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.
DAN.6.19	At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.20	When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?”
DAN.6.21	Daniel answered, “May the king live forever! 
DAN.6.22	My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, Your Majesty.”
DAN.6.23	The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
DAN.6.24	At the king’s command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions’ den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
DAN.6.25	Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every language in all the earth:
DAN.6.25	“May you prosper greatly!
DAN.6.26	“I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel.
DAN.6.26	“For he is the living God
DAN.6.26	and he endures forever;
DAN.6.26	his kingdom will not be destroyed,
DAN.6.26	his dominion will never end.
DAN.6.27	He rescues and he saves;
DAN.6.27	he performs signs and wonders
DAN.6.27	in the heavens and on the earth.
DAN.6.27	He has rescued Daniel
DAN.6.27	from the power of the lions.”
DAN.6.28	So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream.
DAN.7.2	Daniel said: “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. 
DAN.7.3	Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea.
DAN.7.4	“The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it.
DAN.7.5	“And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and eat your fill of flesh!’
DAN.7.6	“After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.
DAN.7.7	“After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast—terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.
DAN.7.8	“While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
DAN.7.9	“As I looked,
DAN.7.9	“thrones were set in place,
DAN.7.9	and the Ancient of Days took his seat.
DAN.7.9	His clothing was as white as snow;
DAN.7.9	the hair of his head was white like wool.
DAN.7.9	His throne was flaming with fire,
DAN.7.9	and its wheels were all ablaze.
DAN.7.10	A river of fire was flowing,
DAN.7.10	coming out from before him.
DAN.7.10	Thousands upon thousands attended him;
DAN.7.10	ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.
DAN.7.10	The court was seated,
DAN.7.10	and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	“Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. 
DAN.7.12	(The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)
DAN.7.13	“In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man,
DAN.7.14	He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	“I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. 
DAN.7.16	I approached one of those standing there and asked him the meaning of all this.
DAN.7.16	“So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: 
DAN.7.17	‘The four great beasts are four kings that will rise from the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, for ever and ever.’
DAN.7.19	“Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws—the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. 
DAN.7.20	I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. 
DAN.7.21	As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them, 
DAN.7.22	until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	“He gave me this explanation: ‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. 
DAN.7.24	The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. 
DAN.7.25	He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.
DAN.7.26	“ ‘But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. 
DAN.7.27	Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.’
DAN.7.28	“This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.”
DAN.8.1	In the third year of King Belshazzar’s reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me. 
DAN.8.2	In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal. 
DAN.8.3	I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. 
DAN.8.4	I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great.
DAN.8.5	As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground. 
DAN.8.6	It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage. 
DAN.8.7	I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and none could rescue the ram from its power. 
DAN.8.8	The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.
DAN.8.9	Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land. 
DAN.8.10	It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them. 
DAN.8.11	It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the 
DAN.8.12	Because of rebellion, the 
DAN.8.13	Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, “How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled—the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, the surrender of the sanctuary and the trampling underfoot of the 
DAN.8.14	He said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.”
DAN.8.15	While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man. 
DAN.8.16	And I heard a man’s voice from the Ulai calling, “Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.”
DAN.8.17	As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. “Son of man,”
DAN.8.18	While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet.
DAN.8.19	He said: “I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end.
DAN.8.20	The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. 
DAN.8.21	The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king. 
DAN.8.22	The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.
DAN.8.23	“In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise. 
DAN.8.24	He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people. 
DAN.8.25	He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.
DAN.8.26	“The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.”
DAN.8.27	I, Daniel, was worn out. I lay exhausted for several days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the 
DAN.9.3	So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.
DAN.9.4	I prayed to the 
DAN.9.4	“Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, 
DAN.9.5	we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws. 
DAN.9.6	We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.
DAN.9.7	“Lord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame—the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you. 
DAN.9.8	We and our kings, our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame, 
DAN.9.9	The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him; 
DAN.9.10	we have not obeyed the 
DAN.9.11	All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you.
DAN.9.11	“Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against you. 
DAN.9.12	You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem. 
DAN.9.13	Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the 
DAN.9.14	The 
DAN.9.15	“Now, Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong. 
DAN.9.16	Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.
DAN.9.17	“Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary. 
DAN.9.18	Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy. 
DAN.9.19	Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name.”
DAN.9.20	While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request to the 
DAN.9.21	while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice. 
DAN.9.22	He instructed me and said to me, “Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding. 
DAN.9.23	As soon as you began to pray, a word went out, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision:
DAN.9.24	“Seventy ‘sevens’
DAN.9.25	“Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One,
DAN.9.26	After the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing.
DAN.9.27	He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it concerned a great war.
DAN.10.2	At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.
DAN.10.4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris, 
DAN.10.5	I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. 
DAN.10.6	His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude.
DAN.10.7	I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; those who were with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves. 
DAN.10.8	So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless. 
DAN.10.9	Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground.
DAN.10.10	A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. 
DAN.10.11	He said, “Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling.
DAN.10.12	Then he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. 
DAN.10.13	But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia. 
DAN.10.14	Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.”
DAN.10.15	While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless. 
DAN.10.16	Then one who looked like a man
DAN.10.17	How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe.”
DAN.10.18	Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength. 
DAN.10.19	“Do not be afraid, you who are highly esteemed,” he said. “Peace! Be strong now; be strong.”
DAN.10.19	When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength.”
DAN.10.20	So he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go, the prince of Greece will come; 
DAN.10.21	but first I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. (No one supports me against them except Michael, your prince.
DAN.11.1	And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I took my stand to support and protect him.)
DAN.11.2	“Now then, I tell you the truth: Three more kings will arise in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far richer than all the others. When he has gained power by his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece. 
DAN.11.3	Then a mighty king will arise, who will rule with great power and do as he pleases. 
DAN.11.4	After he has arisen, his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the power he exercised, because his empire will be uprooted and given to others.
DAN.11.5	“The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his own kingdom with great power. 
DAN.11.6	After some years, they will become allies. The daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to make an alliance, but she will not retain her power, and he and his power
DAN.11.7	“One from her family line will arise to take her place. He will attack the forces of the king of the North and enter his fortress; he will fight against them and be victorious. 
DAN.11.8	He will also seize their gods, their metal images and their valuable articles of silver and gold and carry them off to Egypt. For some years he will leave the king of the North alone. 
DAN.11.9	Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will retreat to his own country. 
DAN.11.10	His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army, which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress.
DAN.11.11	“Then the king of the South will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but it will be defeated. 
DAN.11.12	When the army is carried off, the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands, yet he will not remain triumphant. 
DAN.11.13	For the king of the North will muster another army, larger than the first; and after several years, he will advance with a huge army fully equipped.
DAN.11.14	“In those times many will rise against the king of the South. Those who are violent among your own people will rebel in fulfillment of the vision, but without success. 
DAN.11.15	Then the king of the North will come and build up siege ramps and will capture a fortified city. The forces of the South will be powerless to resist; even their best troops will not have the strength to stand. 
DAN.11.16	The invader will do as he pleases; no one will be able to stand against him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land and will have the power to destroy it. 
DAN.11.17	He will determine to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will make an alliance with the king of the South. And he will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom, but his plans
DAN.11.18	Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will take many of them, but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back on him. 
DAN.11.19	After this, he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own country but will stumble and fall, to be seen no more.
DAN.11.20	“His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. In a few years, however, he will be destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle.
DAN.11.21	“He will be succeeded by a contemptible person who has not been given the honor of royalty. He will invade the kingdom when its people feel secure, and he will seize it through intrigue. 
DAN.11.22	Then an overwhelming army will be swept away before him; both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed. 
DAN.11.23	After coming to an agreement with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power. 
DAN.11.24	When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did. He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses—but only for a time.
DAN.11.25	“With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him. 
DAN.11.26	Those who eat from the king’s provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle. 
DAN.11.27	The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time. 
DAN.11.28	The king of the North will return to his own country with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action against it and then return to his own country.
DAN.11.29	“At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before. 
DAN.11.30	Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.
DAN.11.31	“His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation. 
DAN.11.32	With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him.
DAN.11.33	“Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered. 
DAN.11.34	When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them. 
DAN.11.35	Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.
DAN.11.36	“The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place. 
DAN.11.37	He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all. 
DAN.11.38	Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts. 
DAN.11.39	He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price.
DAN.11.40	“At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. 
DAN.11.41	He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand. 
DAN.11.42	He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape. 
DAN.11.43	He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Cushites
DAN.11.44	But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. 
DAN.11.45	He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at
DAN.12.1	“At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered. 
DAN.12.2	Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. 
DAN.12.3	Those who are wise
DAN.12.4	But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge.”
DAN.12.5	Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank. 
DAN.12.6	One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?”
DAN.12.7	The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, “It will be for a time, times and half a time.
DAN.12.8	I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?”
DAN.12.9	He replied, “Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end. 
DAN.12.10	Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.
DAN.12.11	“From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. 
DAN.12.12	Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.
DAN.12.13	“As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.”

HOS.1.5	In that day I will break Israel’s bow in the Valley of Jezreel.”
HOS.1.6	Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the 
HOS.1.7	Yet I will show love to Judah; and I will save them—not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but I, the 
HOS.1.8	After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son. 
HOS.1.9	Then the 
HOS.1.10	“Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘children of the living God.’ 
HOS.1.11	The people of Judah and the people of Israel will come together; they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.
HOS.2.1	“Say of your brothers, ‘My people,’ and of your sisters, ‘My loved one.’
HOS.2.2	“Rebuke your mother, rebuke her,
HOS.2.2	for she is not my wife,
HOS.2.2	and I am not her husband.
HOS.2.2	Let her remove the adulterous look from her face
HOS.2.2	and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.
HOS.2.3	Otherwise I will strip her naked
HOS.2.3	and make her as bare as on the day she was born;
HOS.2.3	I will make her like a desert,
HOS.2.3	turn her into a parched land,
HOS.2.3	and slay her with thirst.
HOS.2.4	I will not show my love to her children,
HOS.2.4	because they are the children of adultery.
HOS.2.5	Their mother has been unfaithful
HOS.2.5	and has conceived them in disgrace.
HOS.2.5	She said, ‘I will go after my lovers,
HOS.2.5	who give me my food and my water,
HOS.2.5	my wool and my linen, my olive oil and my drink.’
HOS.2.6	Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes;
HOS.2.6	I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.
HOS.2.7	She will chase after her lovers but not catch them;
HOS.2.7	she will look for them but not find them.
HOS.2.7	Then she will say,
HOS.2.7	‘I will go back to my husband as at first,
HOS.2.7	for then I was better off than now.’
HOS.2.8	She has not acknowledged that I was the one
HOS.2.8	who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil,
HOS.2.8	who lavished on her the silver and gold—
HOS.2.8	which they used for Baal.
HOS.2.9	“Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens,
HOS.2.9	and my new wine when it is ready.
HOS.2.9	I will take back my wool and my linen,
HOS.2.9	intended to cover her naked body.
HOS.2.10	So now I will expose her lewdness
HOS.2.10	before the eyes of her lovers;
HOS.2.10	no one will take her out of my hands.
HOS.2.11	I will stop all her celebrations:
HOS.2.11	her yearly festivals, her New Moons,
HOS.2.11	her Sabbath days—all her appointed festivals.
HOS.2.12	I will ruin her vines and her fig trees,
HOS.2.12	which she said were her pay from her lovers;
HOS.2.12	I will make them a thicket,
HOS.2.12	and wild animals will devour them.
HOS.2.13	I will punish her for the days
HOS.2.13	she burned incense to the Baals;
HOS.2.13	she decked herself with rings and jewelry,
HOS.2.13	and went after her lovers,
HOS.2.13	but me she forgot,”
HOS.2.13	declares the 
HOS.2.14	“Therefore I am now going to allure her;
HOS.2.14	I will lead her into the wilderness

HOS.2.18	In that day I will make a covenant for them
HOS.2.18	with the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky

HOS.2.22	and the earth will respond to the grain,
HOS.2.22	the new wine and the olive oil,
HOS.2.22	and they will respond to Jezreel.
HOS.2.23	I will plant her for myself in the land;
HOS.2.23	I will show my love to the one I called ‘Not my loved one.
HOS.2.23	I will say to those called ‘Not my people,

HOS.3.1	The 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her for fifteen shekels
HOS.3.3	Then I told her, “You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will behave the same way toward you.”
HOS.3.4	For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or household gods. 
HOS.3.5	Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the 
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of the 
HOS.4.1	because the 
HOS.4.1	against you who live in the land:
HOS.4.1	“There is no faithfulness, no love,
HOS.4.1	no acknowledgment of God in the land.
HOS.4.2	There is only cursing,
HOS.4.2	stealing and adultery;
HOS.4.2	they break all bounds,
HOS.4.2	and bloodshed follows bloodshed.
HOS.4.3	Because of this the land dries up,
HOS.4.3	and all who live in it waste away;
HOS.4.3	the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky
HOS.4.3	and the fish in the sea are swept away.
HOS.4.4	“But let no one bring a charge,
HOS.4.4	let no one accuse another,
HOS.4.4	for your people are like those
HOS.4.4	who bring charges against a priest.
HOS.4.5	You stumble day and night,
HOS.4.5	and the prophets stumble with you.
HOS.4.5	So I will destroy your mother—
HOS.4.6	my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge.
HOS.4.6	“Because you have rejected knowledge,
HOS.4.6	I also reject you as my priests;
HOS.4.6	because you have ignored the law of your God,
HOS.4.6	I also will ignore your children.
HOS.4.7	The more priests there were,
HOS.4.7	the more they sinned against me;
HOS.4.7	they exchanged their glorious God
HOS.4.8	They feed on the sins of my people
HOS.4.8	and relish their wickedness.
HOS.4.9	And it will be: Like people, like priests.
HOS.4.9	I will punish both of them for their ways
HOS.4.9	and repay them for their deeds.
HOS.4.10	“They will eat but not have enough;
HOS.4.10	they will engage in prostitution but not flourish,
HOS.4.10	because they have deserted the 
HOS.4.10	to give themselves 
HOS.4.11	to prostitution;
HOS.4.11	old wine and new wine
HOS.4.11	take away their understanding.
HOS.4.12	My people consult a wooden idol,
HOS.4.12	and a diviner’s rod speaks to them.
HOS.4.12	A spirit of prostitution leads them astray;
HOS.4.12	they are unfaithful to their God.
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice on the mountaintops
HOS.4.13	and burn offerings on the hills,
HOS.4.13	under oak, poplar and terebinth,
HOS.4.13	where the shade is pleasant.
HOS.4.13	Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution
HOS.4.13	and your daughters-in-law to adultery.
HOS.4.14	“I will not punish your daughters
HOS.4.14	when they turn to prostitution,
HOS.4.14	nor your daughters-in-law
HOS.4.14	when they commit adultery,
HOS.4.14	because the men themselves consort with harlots
HOS.4.14	and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes—
HOS.4.14	a people without understanding will come to ruin!
HOS.4.15	“Though you, Israel, commit adultery,
HOS.4.15	do not let Judah become guilty.
HOS.4.15	“Do not go to Gilgal;
HOS.4.15	do not go up to Beth Aven.
HOS.4.15	And do not swear, ‘As surely as the 
HOS.4.16	The Israelites are stubborn,
HOS.4.16	like a stubborn heifer.
HOS.4.16	How then can the 
HOS.4.16	like lambs in a meadow?
HOS.4.17	Ephraim is joined to idols;
HOS.4.17	leave him alone!
HOS.4.18	Even when their drinks are gone,
HOS.4.18	they continue their prostitution;
HOS.4.18	their rulers dearly love shameful ways.
HOS.4.19	A whirlwind will sweep them away,
HOS.4.19	and their sacrifices will bring them shame.
HOS.5.1	“Hear this, you priests!
HOS.5.1	Pay attention, you Israelites!
HOS.5.1	Listen, royal house!
HOS.5.1	This judgment is against you:
HOS.5.1	You have been a snare at Mizpah,
HOS.5.1	a net spread out on Tabor.
HOS.5.2	The rebels are knee-deep in slaughter.
HOS.5.2	I will discipline all of them.
HOS.5.3	I know all about Ephraim;
HOS.5.3	Israel is not hidden from me.
HOS.5.3	Ephraim, you have now turned to prostitution;
HOS.5.3	Israel is corrupt.
HOS.5.4	“Their deeds do not permit them
HOS.5.4	to return to their God.
HOS.5.4	A spirit of prostitution is in their heart;
HOS.5.4	they do not acknowledge the 
HOS.5.5	Israel’s arrogance testifies against them;
HOS.5.5	the Israelites, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin;
HOS.5.5	Judah also stumbles with them.
HOS.5.6	When they go with their flocks and herds
HOS.5.6	to seek the 
HOS.5.6	they will not find him;
HOS.5.6	he has withdrawn himself from them.
HOS.5.7	They are unfaithful to the 
HOS.5.7	they give birth to illegitimate children.
HOS.5.7	When they celebrate their New Moon feasts,
HOS.5.7	he will devour
HOS.5.8	“Sound the trumpet in Gibeah,
HOS.5.8	the horn in Ramah.
HOS.5.8	Raise the battle cry in Beth Aven
HOS.5.8	lead on, Benjamin.
HOS.5.9	Ephraim will be laid waste
HOS.5.9	on the day of reckoning.
HOS.5.9	Among the tribes of Israel
HOS.5.9	I proclaim what is certain.
HOS.5.10	Judah’s leaders are like those
HOS.5.10	who move boundary stones.
HOS.5.10	I will pour out my wrath on them
HOS.5.10	like a flood of water.
HOS.5.11	Ephraim is oppressed,
HOS.5.11	trampled in judgment,
HOS.5.11	intent on pursuing idols.
HOS.5.12	I am like a moth to Ephraim,
HOS.5.12	like rot to the people of Judah.
HOS.5.13	“When Ephraim saw his sickness,
HOS.5.13	and Judah his sores,
HOS.5.13	then Ephraim turned to Assyria,
HOS.5.13	and sent to the great king for help.
HOS.5.13	But he is not able to cure you,
HOS.5.13	not able to heal your sores.
HOS.5.14	For I will be like a lion to Ephraim,
HOS.5.14	like a great lion to Judah.
HOS.5.14	I will tear them to pieces and go away;
HOS.5.14	I will carry them off, with no one to rescue them.
HOS.5.15	Then I will return to my lair
HOS.5.15	until they have borne their guilt
HOS.5.15	and seek my face—
HOS.5.15	in their misery
HOS.5.15	they will earnestly seek me.”
HOS.6.1	“Come, let us return to the 
HOS.6.1	He has torn us to pieces
HOS.6.1	but he will heal us;
HOS.6.1	he has injured us
HOS.6.1	but he will bind up our wounds.
HOS.6.2	After two days he will revive us;
HOS.6.2	on the third day he will restore us,
HOS.6.2	that we may live in his presence.
HOS.6.3	Let us acknowledge the 
HOS.6.3	let us press on to acknowledge him.
HOS.6.3	As surely as the sun rises,
HOS.6.3	he will appear;
HOS.6.3	he will come to us like the winter rains,
HOS.6.3	like the spring rains that water the earth.”
HOS.6.4	“What can I do with you, Ephraim?
HOS.6.4	What can I do with you, Judah?
HOS.6.4	Your love is like the morning mist,
HOS.6.4	like the early dew that disappears.
HOS.6.5	Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets,
HOS.6.5	I killed you with the words of my mouth—
HOS.6.5	then my judgments go forth like the sun.
HOS.6.6	For I desire mercy, not sacrifice,
HOS.6.6	and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.
HOS.6.7	As at Adam,
HOS.6.7	they were unfaithful to me there.
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of evildoers,
HOS.6.8	stained with footprints of blood.
HOS.6.9	As marauders lie in ambush for a victim,
HOS.6.9	so do bands of priests;
HOS.6.9	they murder on the road to Shechem,
HOS.6.9	carrying out their wicked schemes.
HOS.6.10	I have seen a horrible thing in Israel:
HOS.6.10	There Ephraim is given to prostitution,
HOS.6.10	Israel is defiled.
HOS.6.11	“Also for you, Judah,
HOS.6.11	a harvest is appointed.
HOS.6.11	“Whenever I would restore the fortunes of my people,
HOS.7.1	whenever I would heal Israel,
HOS.7.1	the sins of Ephraim are exposed
HOS.7.1	and the crimes of Samaria revealed.
HOS.7.1	They practice deceit,
HOS.7.1	thieves break into houses,
HOS.7.1	bandits rob in the streets;
HOS.7.2	but they do not realize
HOS.7.2	that I remember all their evil deeds.
HOS.7.2	Their sins engulf them;
HOS.7.2	they are always before me.
HOS.7.3	“They delight the king with their wickedness,
HOS.7.3	the princes with their lies.
HOS.7.4	They are all adulterers,
HOS.7.4	burning like an oven
HOS.7.4	whose fire the baker need not stir
HOS.7.4	from the kneading of the dough till it rises.
HOS.7.5	On the day of the festival of our king
HOS.7.5	the princes become inflamed with wine,
HOS.7.5	and he joins hands with the mockers.
HOS.7.6	Their hearts are like an oven;
HOS.7.6	they approach him with intrigue.
HOS.7.6	Their passion smolders all night;
HOS.7.6	in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
HOS.7.7	All of them are hot as an oven;
HOS.7.7	they devour their rulers.
HOS.7.7	All their kings fall,
HOS.7.7	and none of them calls on me.
HOS.7.8	“Ephraim mixes with the nations;
HOS.7.8	Ephraim is a flat loaf not turned over.
HOS.7.9	Foreigners sap his strength,
HOS.7.9	but he does not realize it.
HOS.7.9	His hair is sprinkled with gray,
HOS.7.9	but he does not notice.
HOS.7.10	Israel’s arrogance testifies against him,
HOS.7.10	but despite all this
HOS.7.10	he does not return to the 
HOS.7.10	or search for him.
HOS.7.11	“Ephraim is like a dove,
HOS.7.11	easily deceived and senseless—
HOS.7.11	now calling to Egypt,
HOS.7.11	now turning to Assyria.
HOS.7.12	When they go, I will throw my net over them;
HOS.7.12	I will pull them down like the birds in the sky.
HOS.7.12	When I hear them flocking together,
HOS.7.12	I will catch them.
HOS.7.13	Woe to them,
HOS.7.13	because they have strayed from me!
HOS.7.13	Destruction to them,
HOS.7.13	because they have rebelled against me!
HOS.7.13	I long to redeem them
HOS.7.13	but they speak about me falsely.
HOS.7.14	They do not cry out to me from their hearts
HOS.7.14	but wail on their beds.
HOS.7.14	They slash themselves,
HOS.7.14	for grain and new wine,
HOS.7.14	but they turn away from me.
HOS.7.15	I trained them and strengthened their arms,
HOS.7.15	but they plot evil against me.
HOS.7.16	They do not turn to the Most High;
HOS.7.16	they are like a faulty bow.
HOS.7.16	Their leaders will fall by the sword
HOS.7.16	because of their insolent words.
HOS.7.16	For this they will be ridiculed
HOS.7.16	in the land of Egypt.
HOS.8.1	“Put the trumpet to your lips!
HOS.8.1	An eagle is over the house of the 
HOS.8.1	because the people have broken my covenant
HOS.8.1	and rebelled against my law.
HOS.8.2	Israel cries out to me,
HOS.8.2	‘Our God, we acknowledge you!’
HOS.8.3	But Israel has rejected what is good;
HOS.8.3	an enemy will pursue him.
HOS.8.4	They set up kings without my consent;
HOS.8.4	they choose princes without my approval.
HOS.8.4	With their silver and gold
HOS.8.4	they make idols for themselves
HOS.8.4	to their own destruction.
HOS.8.5	Samaria, throw out your calf-idol!
HOS.8.5	My anger burns against them.
HOS.8.5	How long will they be incapable of purity?
HOS.8.6	They are from Israel!
HOS.8.6	This calf—a metalworker has made it;
HOS.8.6	it is not God.
HOS.8.6	It will be broken in pieces,
HOS.8.6	that calf of Samaria.
HOS.8.7	“They sow the wind
HOS.8.7	and reap the whirlwind.
HOS.8.7	The stalk has no head;
HOS.8.7	it will produce no flour.
HOS.8.7	Were it to yield grain,
HOS.8.7	foreigners would swallow it up.
HOS.8.8	Israel is swallowed up;
HOS.8.8	now she is among the nations
HOS.8.8	like something no one wants.
HOS.8.9	For they have gone up to Assyria
HOS.8.9	like a wild donkey wandering alone.
HOS.8.9	Ephraim has sold herself to lovers.
HOS.8.10	Although they have sold themselves among the nations,
HOS.8.10	I will now gather them together.
HOS.8.10	They will begin to waste away
HOS.8.10	under the oppression of the mighty king.
HOS.8.11	“Though Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings,
HOS.8.11	these have become altars for sinning.
HOS.8.12	I wrote for them the many things of my law,
HOS.8.12	but they regarded them as something foreign.
HOS.8.13	Though they offer sacrifices as gifts to me,
HOS.8.13	and though they eat the meat,
HOS.8.13	the 
HOS.8.13	Now he will remember their wickedness
HOS.8.13	and punish their sins:
HOS.8.13	They will return to Egypt.
HOS.8.14	Israel has forgotten their Maker
HOS.8.14	and built palaces;
HOS.8.14	Judah has fortified many towns.
HOS.8.14	But I will send fire on their cities
HOS.8.14	that will consume their fortresses.”
HOS.9.1	Do not rejoice, Israel;
HOS.9.1	do not be jubilant like the other nations.
HOS.9.1	For you have been unfaithful to your God;
HOS.9.1	you love the wages of a prostitute
HOS.9.1	at every threshing floor.
HOS.9.2	Threshing floors and winepresses will not feed the people;
HOS.9.2	the new wine will fail them.
HOS.9.3	They will not remain in the 
HOS.9.3	Ephraim will return to Egypt
HOS.9.3	and eat unclean food in Assyria.
HOS.9.4	They will not pour out wine offerings to the 
HOS.9.4	nor will their sacrifices please him.
HOS.9.4	Such sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners;
HOS.9.4	all who eat them will be unclean.
HOS.9.4	This food will be for themselves;
HOS.9.4	it will not come into the temple of the 
HOS.9.5	What will you do on the day of your appointed festivals,
HOS.9.5	on the feast days of the 
HOS.9.6	Even if they escape from destruction,
HOS.9.6	Egypt will gather them,
HOS.9.6	and Memphis will bury them.
HOS.9.6	Their treasures of silver will be taken over by briers,
HOS.9.6	and thorns will overrun their tents.
HOS.9.7	The days of punishment are coming,
HOS.9.7	the days of reckoning are at hand.
HOS.9.7	Let Israel know this.
HOS.9.7	Because your sins are so many
HOS.9.7	and your hostility so great,
HOS.9.7	the prophet is considered a fool,
HOS.9.7	the inspired person a maniac.
HOS.9.8	The prophet, along with my God,
HOS.9.8	is the watchman over Ephraim,
HOS.9.8	yet snares await him on all his paths,
HOS.9.8	and hostility in the house of his God.
HOS.9.9	They have sunk deep into corruption,
HOS.9.9	as in the days of Gibeah.
HOS.9.9	God will remember their wickedness
HOS.9.9	and punish them for their sins.
HOS.9.10	“When I found Israel,
HOS.9.10	it was like finding grapes in the desert;
HOS.9.10	when I saw your ancestors,
HOS.9.10	it was like seeing the early fruit on the fig tree.
HOS.9.10	But when they came to Baal Peor,
HOS.9.10	they consecrated themselves to that shameful idol
HOS.9.10	and became as vile as the thing they loved.
HOS.9.11	Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird—
HOS.9.11	no birth, no pregnancy, no conception.
HOS.9.12	Even if they rear children,
HOS.9.12	I will bereave them of every one.
HOS.9.12	Woe to them
HOS.9.12	when I turn away from them!
HOS.9.13	I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre,
HOS.9.13	planted in a pleasant place.
HOS.9.13	But Ephraim will bring out
HOS.9.13	their children to the slayer.”
HOS.9.14	Give them, 
HOS.9.14	what will you give them?
HOS.9.14	Give them wombs that miscarry
HOS.9.14	and breasts that are dry.
HOS.9.15	“Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal,
HOS.9.15	I hated them there.
HOS.9.15	Because of their sinful deeds,
HOS.9.15	I will drive them out of my house.
HOS.9.15	I will no longer love them;
HOS.9.15	all their leaders are rebellious.
HOS.9.16	Ephraim is blighted,
HOS.9.16	their root is withered,
HOS.9.16	they yield no fruit.
HOS.9.16	Even if they bear children,
HOS.9.16	I will slay their cherished offspring.”
HOS.9.17	My God will reject them
HOS.9.17	because they have not obeyed him;
HOS.9.17	they will be wanderers among the nations.
HOS.10.1	Israel was a spreading vine;
HOS.10.1	he brought forth fruit for himself.
HOS.10.1	As his fruit increased,
HOS.10.1	he built more altars;
HOS.10.1	as his land prospered,
HOS.10.1	he adorned his sacred stones.
HOS.10.2	Their heart is deceitful,
HOS.10.2	and now they must bear their guilt.
HOS.10.2	The 
HOS.10.2	and destroy their sacred stones.
HOS.10.3	Then they will say, “We have no king
HOS.10.3	because we did not revere the 
HOS.10.3	But even if we had a king,
HOS.10.3	what could he do for us?”
HOS.10.4	They make many promises,
HOS.10.4	take false oaths
HOS.10.4	and make agreements;
HOS.10.4	therefore lawsuits spring up
HOS.10.4	like poisonous weeds in a plowed field.
HOS.10.5	The people who live in Samaria fear
HOS.10.5	for the calf-idol of Beth Aven.
HOS.10.5	Its people will mourn over it,
HOS.10.5	and so will its idolatrous priests,
HOS.10.5	those who had rejoiced over its splendor,
HOS.10.5	because it is taken from them into exile.
HOS.10.6	It will be carried to Assyria
HOS.10.6	as tribute for the great king.
HOS.10.6	Ephraim will be disgraced;
HOS.10.6	Israel will be ashamed of its foreign alliances.
HOS.10.7	Samaria’s king will be destroyed,
HOS.10.7	swept away like a twig on the surface of the waters.
HOS.10.8	The high places of wickedness
HOS.10.8	it is the sin of Israel.
HOS.10.8	Thorns and thistles will grow up
HOS.10.8	and cover their altars.
HOS.10.8	Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!”
HOS.10.8	and to the hills, “Fall on us!”
HOS.10.9	“Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, Israel,
HOS.10.9	and there you have remained.
HOS.10.9	Will not war again overtake
HOS.10.9	the evildoers in Gibeah?
HOS.10.10	When I please, I will punish them;
HOS.10.10	nations will be gathered against them
HOS.10.10	to put them in bonds for their double sin.
HOS.10.11	Ephraim is a trained heifer
HOS.10.11	that loves to thresh;
HOS.10.11	so I will put a yoke
HOS.10.11	on her fair neck.
HOS.10.11	I will drive Ephraim,
HOS.10.11	Judah must plow,
HOS.10.11	and Jacob must break up the ground.
HOS.10.12	Sow righteousness for yourselves,
HOS.10.12	reap the fruit of unfailing love,
HOS.10.12	and break up your unplowed ground;
HOS.10.12	for it is time to seek the 
HOS.10.12	until he comes
HOS.10.12	and showers his righteousness on you.
HOS.10.13	But you have planted wickedness,
HOS.10.13	you have reaped evil,
HOS.10.13	you have eaten the fruit of deception.
HOS.10.13	Because you have depended on your own strength
HOS.10.13	and on your many warriors,
HOS.10.14	the roar of battle will rise against your people,
HOS.10.14	so that all your fortresses will be devastated—
HOS.10.14	as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle,
HOS.10.14	when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children.
HOS.10.15	So will it happen to you, Bethel,
HOS.10.15	because your wickedness is great.
HOS.10.15	When that day dawns,
HOS.10.15	the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.
HOS.11.1	“When Israel was a child, I loved him,
HOS.11.1	and out of Egypt I called my son.
HOS.11.2	But the more they were called,
HOS.11.2	the more they went away from me.
HOS.11.2	They sacrificed to the Baals
HOS.11.2	and they burned incense to images.
HOS.11.3	It was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
HOS.11.3	taking them by the arms;
HOS.11.3	but they did not realize
HOS.11.3	it was I who healed them.
HOS.11.4	I led them with cords of human kindness,
HOS.11.4	with ties of love.
HOS.11.4	To them I was like one who lifts
HOS.11.4	a little child to the cheek,
HOS.11.4	and I bent down to feed them.
HOS.11.5	“Will they not return to Egypt
HOS.11.5	and will not Assyria rule over them
HOS.11.5	because they refuse to repent?
HOS.11.6	A sword will flash in their cities;
HOS.11.6	it will devour their false prophets
HOS.11.6	and put an end to their plans.
HOS.11.7	My people are determined to turn from me.
HOS.11.7	Even though they call me God Most High,
HOS.11.7	I will by no means exalt them.
HOS.11.8	“How can I give you up, Ephraim?
HOS.11.8	How can I hand you over, Israel?
HOS.11.8	How can I treat you like Admah?
HOS.11.8	How can I make you like Zeboyim?
HOS.11.8	My heart is changed within me;
HOS.11.8	all my compassion is aroused.
HOS.11.9	I will not carry out my fierce anger,
HOS.11.9	nor will I devastate Ephraim again.
HOS.11.9	For I am God, and not a man—
HOS.11.9	the Holy One among you.
HOS.11.9	I will not come against their cities.
HOS.11.10	They will follow the 
HOS.11.10	he will roar like a lion.
HOS.11.10	When he roars,
HOS.11.10	his children will come trembling from the west.
HOS.11.11	They will come from Egypt,
HOS.11.11	trembling like sparrows,
HOS.11.11	from Assyria, fluttering like doves.
HOS.11.11	I will settle them in their homes,”
HOS.11.11	declares the 
HOS.11.12	Ephraim has surrounded me with lies,
HOS.11.12	Israel with deceit.
HOS.11.12	And Judah is unruly against God,
HOS.11.12	even against the faithful Holy One.
HOS.12.1	Ephraim feeds on the wind;
HOS.12.1	he pursues the east wind all day
HOS.12.1	and multiplies lies and violence.
HOS.12.1	He makes a treaty with Assyria
HOS.12.1	and sends olive oil to Egypt.
HOS.12.2	The

HOS.12.2	and repay him according to his deeds.
HOS.12.3	In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel;
HOS.12.3	as a man he struggled with God.
HOS.12.4	He struggled with the angel and overcame him;
HOS.12.4	he wept and begged for his favor.
HOS.12.4	He found him at Bethel
HOS.12.4	and talked with him there—
HOS.12.5	the 
HOS.12.5	the 
HOS.12.6	But you must return to your God;
HOS.12.6	maintain love and justice,
HOS.12.6	and wait for your God always.
HOS.12.7	The merchant uses dishonest scales
HOS.12.7	and loves to defraud.
HOS.12.8	Ephraim boasts,
HOS.12.8	“I am very rich; I have become wealthy.
HOS.12.8	With all my wealth they will not find in me
HOS.12.8	any iniquity or sin.”
HOS.12.9	“I have been the 
HOS.12.9	ever since you came out of Egypt;
HOS.12.9	I will make you live in tents again,
HOS.12.9	as in the days of your appointed festivals.
HOS.12.10	I spoke to the prophets,
HOS.12.10	gave them many visions
HOS.12.10	and told parables through them.”
HOS.12.11	Is Gilead wicked?
HOS.12.11	Its people are worthless!
HOS.12.11	Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal?
HOS.12.11	Their altars will be like piles of stones
HOS.12.11	on a plowed field.
HOS.12.12	Jacob fled to the country of Aram
HOS.12.12	Israel served to get a wife,
HOS.12.12	and to pay for her he tended sheep.
HOS.12.13	The 
HOS.12.13	by a prophet he cared for him.
HOS.12.14	But Ephraim has aroused his bitter anger;
HOS.12.14	his Lord will leave on him the guilt of his bloodshed
HOS.12.14	and will repay him for his contempt.
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spoke, people trembled;
HOS.13.1	he was exalted in Israel.
HOS.13.1	But he became guilty of Baal worship and died.
HOS.13.2	Now they sin more and more;
HOS.13.2	they make idols for themselves from their silver,
HOS.13.2	cleverly fashioned images,
HOS.13.2	all of them the work of craftsmen.
HOS.13.2	It is said of these people,
HOS.13.2	“They offer human sacrifices!
HOS.13.2	They kiss
HOS.13.3	Therefore they will be like the morning mist,
HOS.13.3	like the early dew that disappears,
HOS.13.3	like chaff swirling from a threshing floor,
HOS.13.3	like smoke escaping through a window.
HOS.13.4	“But I have been the 
HOS.13.4	ever since you came out of Egypt.
HOS.13.4	You shall acknowledge no God but me,
HOS.13.4	no Savior except me.
HOS.13.5	I cared for you in the wilderness,
HOS.13.5	in the land of burning heat.
HOS.13.6	When I fed them, they were satisfied;
HOS.13.6	when they were satisfied, they became proud;
HOS.13.6	then they forgot me.
HOS.13.7	So I will be like a lion to them,
HOS.13.7	like a leopard I will lurk by the path.
HOS.13.8	Like a bear robbed of her cubs,
HOS.13.8	I will attack them and rip them open;
HOS.13.8	like a lion I will devour them—
HOS.13.8	a wild animal will tear them apart.
HOS.13.9	“You are destroyed, Israel,
HOS.13.9	because you are against me, against your helper.
HOS.13.10	Where is your king, that he may save you?
HOS.13.10	Where are your rulers in all your towns,
HOS.13.10	of whom you said,
HOS.13.10	‘Give me a king and princes’?
HOS.13.11	So in my anger I gave you a king,
HOS.13.11	and in my wrath I took him away.
HOS.13.12	The guilt of Ephraim is stored up,
HOS.13.12	his sins are kept on record.
HOS.13.13	Pains as of a woman in childbirth come to him,
HOS.13.13	but he is a child without wisdom;
HOS.13.13	when the time arrives,
HOS.13.13	he doesn’t have the sense to come out of the womb.
HOS.13.14	“I will deliver this people from the power of the grave;
HOS.13.14	I will redeem them from death.
HOS.13.14	Where, O death, are your plagues?
HOS.13.14	Where, O grave, is your destruction?
HOS.13.14	“I will have no compassion,
HOS.13.15	even though he thrives among his brothers.
HOS.13.15	An east wind from the 
HOS.13.15	blowing in from the desert;
HOS.13.15	his spring will fail
HOS.13.15	and his well dry up.
HOS.13.15	His storehouse will be plundered
HOS.13.15	of all its treasures.
HOS.13.16	The people of Samaria must bear their guilt,
HOS.13.16	because they have rebelled against their God.
HOS.13.16	They will fall by the sword;
HOS.13.16	their little ones will be dashed to the ground,
HOS.13.16	their pregnant women ripped open.”
HOS.14.1	Return, Israel, to the 
HOS.14.1	Your sins have been your downfall!
HOS.14.2	Take words with you
HOS.14.2	and return to the 
HOS.14.2	Say to him:
HOS.14.2	“Forgive all our sins
HOS.14.2	and receive us graciously,
HOS.14.2	that we may offer the fruit of our lips.
HOS.14.3	Assyria cannot save us;
HOS.14.3	we will not mount warhorses.
HOS.14.3	We will never again say ‘Our gods’
HOS.14.3	to what our own hands have made,
HOS.14.3	for in you the fatherless find compassion.”
HOS.14.4	“I will heal their waywardness
HOS.14.4	and love them freely,
HOS.14.4	for my anger has turned away from them.
HOS.14.5	I will be like the dew to Israel;
HOS.14.5	he will blossom like a lily.
HOS.14.5	Like a cedar of Lebanon
HOS.14.5	he will send down his roots;
HOS.14.6	his young shoots will grow.
HOS.14.6	His splendor will be like an olive tree,
HOS.14.6	his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon.
HOS.14.7	People will dwell again in his shade;
HOS.14.7	they will flourish like the grain,
HOS.14.7	they will blossom like the vine—
HOS.14.7	Israel’s fame will be like the wine of Lebanon.
HOS.14.8	Ephraim, what more have I
HOS.14.8	I will answer him and care for him.
HOS.14.8	I am like a flourishing juniper;
HOS.14.8	your fruitfulness comes from me.”
HOS.14.9	Who is wise? Let them realize these things.
HOS.14.9	Who is discerning? Let them understand.

JOL.1.5	Wail, all you drinkers of wine;
JOL.1.5	wail because of the new wine,
JOL.1.5	for it has been snatched from your lips.
JOL.1.6	A nation has invaded my land,
JOL.1.6	a mighty army without number;
JOL.1.6	it has the teeth of a lion,
JOL.1.6	the fangs of a lioness.
JOL.1.7	It has laid waste my vines
JOL.1.7	and ruined my fig trees.
JOL.1.7	It has stripped off their bark
JOL.1.7	and thrown it away,
JOL.1.7	leaving their branches white.
JOL.1.8	Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth

JOL.1.12	the pomegranate, the palm and the apple
JOL.1.12	all the trees of the field—are dried up.
JOL.1.12	Surely the people’s joy
JOL.1.12	is withered away.
JOL.1.13	Put on sackcloth, you priests, and mourn;

JOL.1.13	Come, spend the night in sackcloth,

JOL.1.18	How the cattle moan!

JOL.1.18	even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
JOL.1.19	To you, 
JOL.1.19	for fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness
JOL.1.19	and flames have burned up all the trees of the field.
JOL.1.20	Even the wild animals pant for you;
JOL.1.20	the streams of water have dried up
JOL.1.20	and fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness.
JOL.2.1	Blow the trumpet in Zion;

JOL.2.2	Like dawn spreading across the mountains
JOL.2.2	a large and mighty army comes,
JOL.2.2	such as never was in ancient times
JOL.2.2	nor ever will be in ages to come.
JOL.2.3	Before them fire devours,
JOL.2.3	behind them a flame blazes.
JOL.2.3	Before them the land is like the garden of Eden,
JOL.2.3	behind them, a desert waste—
JOL.2.3	nothing escapes them.
JOL.2.4	They have the appearance of horses;
JOL.2.4	they gallop along like cavalry.
JOL.2.5	With a noise like that of chariots
JOL.2.5	they leap over the mountaintops,
JOL.2.5	like a crackling fire consuming stubble,
JOL.2.5	like a mighty army drawn up for battle.
JOL.2.6	At the sight of them, nations are in anguish;
JOL.2.6	every face turns pale.
JOL.2.7	They charge like warriors;
JOL.2.7	they scale walls like soldiers.
JOL.2.7	They all march in line,
JOL.2.7	not swerving from their course.
JOL.2.8	They do not jostle each other;
JOL.2.8	each marches straight ahead.
JOL.2.8	They plunge through defenses
JOL.2.8	without breaking ranks.
JOL.2.9	They rush upon the city;
JOL.2.9	they run along the wall.
JOL.2.9	They climb into the houses;
JOL.2.9	like thieves they enter through the windows.
JOL.2.10	Before them the earth shakes,

JOL.2.13	Rend your heart

JOL.2.13	Return to the

JOL.2.13	slow to anger and abounding in love,

JOL.2.19	enough to satisfy you fully;
JOL.2.19	never again will I make you
JOL.2.19	an object of scorn to the nations.
JOL.2.20	“I will drive the northern horde far from you,
JOL.2.20	pushing it into a parched and barren land;
JOL.2.20	its eastern ranks will drown in the Dead Sea
JOL.2.20	and its western ranks in the Mediterranean Sea.
JOL.2.20	And its stench will go up;
JOL.2.20	its smell will rise.”
JOL.2.20	Surely he has done great things!
JOL.2.21	Do not be afraid, land of Judah;
JOL.2.21	be glad and rejoice.
JOL.2.21	Surely the 
JOL.2.22	Do not be afraid, you wild animals,
JOL.2.22	for the pastures in the wilderness are becoming green.
JOL.2.22	The trees are bearing their fruit;

JOL.2.23	both autumn and spring rains, as before.
JOL.2.24	The threshing floors will be filled with grain;
JOL.2.24	the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.

JOL.2.25	the great locust and the young locust,
JOL.2.25	the other locusts and the locust swarm
JOL.2.25	my great army that I sent among you.
JOL.2.26	You will have plenty to eat, until you are full,
JOL.2.26	and you will praise the name of the 
JOL.2.26	who has worked wonders for you;
JOL.2.26	never again will my people be shamed.
JOL.2.27	Then you will know that I am in Israel,

JOL.2.29	Even on my servants, both men and women,
JOL.2.29	I will pour out my Spirit in those days.
JOL.2.30	I will show wonders in the heavens

JOL.3.1	when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
JOL.3.2	I will gather all nations
JOL.3.2	and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.
JOL.3.2	There I will put them on trial
JOL.3.2	for what they did to my inheritance, my people Israel,
JOL.3.2	because they scattered my people among the nations
JOL.3.2	and divided up my land.
JOL.3.3	They cast lots for my people
JOL.3.3	and traded boys for prostitutes;
JOL.3.3	they sold girls for wine to drink.
JOL.3.4	“Now what have you against me, Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done. 
JOL.3.5	For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples.

JOL.3.11	Come quickly, all you nations from every side,
JOL.3.11	and assemble there.

JOL.3.18	A fountain will flow out of the

JOL.3.19	But Egypt will be desolate,
JOL.3.19	Edom a desert waste,
JOL.3.19	because of violence done to the people of Judah,
JOL.3.19	in whose land they shed innocent blood.

AMO.2.7	and deny justice to the oppressed.
AMO.2.7	Father and son use the same girl
AMO.2.7	and so profane my holy name.
AMO.2.8	They lie down beside every altar
AMO.2.8	on garments taken in pledge.
AMO.2.8	In the house of their god
AMO.2.8	they drink wine taken as fines.
AMO.2.9	“Yet I destroyed the Amorites before them,
AMO.2.9	though they were tall as the cedars
AMO.2.9	and strong as the oaks.
AMO.2.9	I destroyed their fruit above
AMO.2.9	and their roots below.
AMO.2.10	I brought you up out of Egypt
AMO.2.10	and led you forty years in the wilderness
AMO.2.10	to give you the land of the Amorites.
AMO.2.11	“I also raised up prophets from among your children
AMO.2.11	and Nazirites from among your youths.
AMO.2.11	Is this not true, people of Israel?”
AMO.2.11	declares the 
AMO.2.12	“But you made the Nazirites drink wine
AMO.2.12	and commanded the prophets not to prophesy.
AMO.2.13	“Now then, I will crush you
AMO.2.13	as a cart crushes when loaded with grain.
AMO.2.14	The swift will not escape,
AMO.2.14	the strong will not muster their strength,
AMO.2.14	and the warrior will not save his life.
AMO.2.15	The archer will not stand his ground,
AMO.2.15	the fleet-footed soldier will not get away,
AMO.2.15	and the horseman will not save his life.
AMO.2.16	Even the bravest warriors
AMO.2.16	will flee naked on that day,”
AMO.2.16	declares the 
AMO.3.1	Hear this word, people of Israel, the word the 
AMO.3.2	“You only have I chosen
AMO.3.2	of all the families of the earth;
AMO.3.2	therefore I will punish you
AMO.3.2	for all your sins.”
AMO.3.3	Do two walk together
AMO.3.3	unless they have agreed to do so?
AMO.3.4	Does a lion roar in the thicket
AMO.3.4	when it has no prey?
AMO.3.4	Does it growl in its den
AMO.3.4	when it has caught nothing?
AMO.3.5	Does a bird swoop down to a trap on the ground
AMO.3.5	when no bait is there?
AMO.3.5	Does a trap spring up from the ground
AMO.3.5	if it has not caught anything?
AMO.3.6	When a trumpet sounds in a city,
AMO.3.6	do not the people tremble?
AMO.3.6	When disaster comes to a city,
AMO.3.6	has not the 
AMO.3.7	Surely the Sovereign 
AMO.3.7	without revealing his plan
AMO.3.7	to his servants the prophets.
AMO.3.8	The lion has roared—
AMO.3.8	who will not fear?
AMO.3.8	The Sovereign 
AMO.3.8	who can but prophesy?
AMO.3.9	Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod
AMO.3.9	and to the fortresses of Egypt:
AMO.3.9	“Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria;
AMO.3.9	see the great unrest within her
AMO.3.9	and the oppression among her people.”
AMO.3.10	“They do not know how to do right,” declares the 
AMO.3.10	“who store up in their fortresses
AMO.3.10	what they have plundered and looted.”
AMO.3.11	Therefore this is what the Sovereign 
AMO.3.11	“An enemy will overrun your land,
AMO.3.11	pull down your strongholds
AMO.3.11	and plunder your fortresses.”
AMO.3.12	This is what the 
AMO.3.12	“As a shepherd rescues from the lion’s mouth
AMO.3.12	only two leg bones or a piece of an ear,
AMO.3.12	so will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued,
AMO.3.12	with only the head of a bed
AMO.3.12	and a piece of fabric
AMO.3.13	“Hear this and testify against the descendants of Jacob,” declares the Lord, the 
AMO.3.14	“On the day I punish Israel for her sins,
AMO.3.14	I will destroy the altars of Bethel;
AMO.3.14	the horns of the altar will be cut off
AMO.3.14	and fall to the ground.
AMO.3.15	I will tear down the winter house
AMO.3.15	along with the summer house;
AMO.3.15	the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed
AMO.3.15	and the mansions will be demolished,”
AMO.3.15	declares the 
AMO.4.1	Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria,
AMO.4.1	you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy
AMO.4.1	and say to your husbands, “Bring us some drinks!”
AMO.4.2	The Sovereign 
AMO.4.2	“The time will surely come
AMO.4.2	when you will be taken away with hooks,
AMO.4.2	the last of you with fishhooks.
AMO.4.3	You will each go straight out
AMO.4.3	through breaches in the wall,
AMO.4.3	and you will be cast out toward Harmon,
AMO.4.3	declares the 
AMO.4.4	“Go to Bethel and sin;
AMO.4.4	go to Gilgal and sin yet more.
AMO.4.4	Bring your sacrifices every morning,
AMO.4.4	your tithes every three years.
AMO.4.5	Burn leavened bread as a thank offering
AMO.4.5	and brag about your freewill offerings—
AMO.4.5	boast about them, you Israelites,
AMO.4.5	for this is what you love to do,”
AMO.4.5	declares the Sovereign 
AMO.4.6	“I gave you empty stomachs in every city
AMO.4.6	and lack of bread in every town,
AMO.4.6	yet you have not returned to me,”
AMO.4.6	declares the 
AMO.4.7	“I also withheld rain from you
AMO.4.7	when the harvest was still three months away.
AMO.4.7	I sent rain on one town,
AMO.4.7	but withheld it from another.
AMO.4.7	One field had rain;
AMO.4.7	another had none and dried up.
AMO.4.8	People staggered from town to town for water
AMO.4.8	but did not get enough to drink,
AMO.4.8	yet you have not returned to me,”
AMO.4.8	declares the 
AMO.4.9	“Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards,
AMO.4.9	destroying them with blight and mildew.
AMO.4.9	Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees,
AMO.4.9	yet you have not returned to me,”
AMO.4.9	declares the 
AMO.4.10	“I sent plagues among you
AMO.4.10	as I did to Egypt.
AMO.4.10	I killed your young men with the sword,
AMO.4.10	along with your captured horses.
AMO.4.10	I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps,
AMO.4.10	yet you have not returned to me,”
AMO.4.10	declares the 
AMO.4.11	“I overthrew some of you
AMO.4.11	as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
AMO.4.11	You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire,
AMO.4.11	yet you have not returned to me,”
AMO.4.11	declares the 
AMO.4.12	“Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel,
AMO.4.12	and because I will do this to you, Israel,
AMO.4.12	prepare to meet your God.”
AMO.4.13	He who forms the mountains,
AMO.4.13	who creates the wind,
AMO.4.13	and who reveals his thoughts to mankind,
AMO.4.13	who turns dawn to darkness,
AMO.4.13	and treads on the heights of the earth—
AMO.4.13	the 
AMO.5.1	Hear this word, Israel, this lament I take up concerning you:
AMO.5.2	“Fallen is Virgin Israel,
AMO.5.2	never to rise again,
AMO.5.2	deserted in her own land,
AMO.5.2	with no one to lift her up.”
AMO.5.3	This is what the Sovereign 
AMO.5.3	“Your city that marches out a thousand strong
AMO.5.3	will have only a hundred left;
AMO.5.3	your town that marches out a hundred strong
AMO.5.3	will have only ten left.”
AMO.5.4	This is what the 
AMO.5.4	“Seek me and live;
AMO.5.5	do not seek Bethel,
AMO.5.5	do not go to Gilgal,
AMO.5.5	do not journey to Beersheba.
AMO.5.5	For Gilgal will surely go into exile,
AMO.5.5	and Bethel will be reduced to nothing.
AMO.5.6	Seek the 
AMO.5.6	or he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like a fire;
AMO.5.6	it will devour them,
AMO.5.6	and Bethel will have no one to quench it.
AMO.5.7	There are those who turn justice into bitterness
AMO.5.7	and cast righteousness to the ground.
AMO.5.8	He who made the Pleiades and Orion,
AMO.5.8	who turns midnight into dawn
AMO.5.8	and darkens day into night,
AMO.5.8	who calls for the waters of the sea
AMO.5.8	and pours them out over the face of the land—
AMO.5.8	the 
AMO.5.9	With a blinding flash he destroys the stronghold
AMO.5.9	and brings the fortified city to ruin.
AMO.5.10	There are those who hate the one who upholds justice in court
AMO.5.10	and detest the one who tells the truth.
AMO.5.11	You levy a straw tax on the poor
AMO.5.11	and impose a tax on their grain.
AMO.5.11	Therefore, though you have built stone mansions,
AMO.5.11	you will not live in them;
AMO.5.11	though you have planted lush vineyards,
AMO.5.11	you will not drink their wine.
AMO.5.12	For I know how many are your offenses
AMO.5.12	and how great your sins.
AMO.5.12	There are those who oppress the innocent and take bribes
AMO.5.12	and deprive the poor of justice in the courts.
AMO.5.13	Therefore the prudent keep quiet in such times,
AMO.5.13	for the times are evil.
AMO.5.14	Seek good, not evil,
AMO.5.14	that you may live.
AMO.5.14	Then the 
AMO.5.14	just as you say he is.
AMO.5.15	Hate evil, love good;
AMO.5.15	maintain justice in the courts.
AMO.5.15	Perhaps the 
AMO.5.15	on the remnant of Joseph.
AMO.5.16	Therefore this is what the Lord, the 
AMO.5.16	“There will be wailing in all the streets
AMO.5.16	and cries of anguish in every public square.
AMO.5.16	The farmers will be summoned to weep
AMO.5.16	and the mourners to wail.
AMO.5.17	There will be wailing in all the vineyards,
AMO.5.17	for I will pass through your midst,”
AMO.5.17	says the 
AMO.5.18	Woe to you who long
AMO.5.18	for the day of the 
AMO.5.18	Why do you long for the day of the 
AMO.5.18	That day will be darkness, not light.
AMO.5.19	It will be as though a man fled from a lion
AMO.5.19	only to meet a bear,
AMO.5.19	as though he entered his house
AMO.5.19	and rested his hand on the wall
AMO.5.19	only to have a snake bite him.
AMO.5.20	Will not the day of the 
AMO.5.20	pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness?
AMO.5.21	“I hate, I despise your religious festivals;
AMO.5.21	your assemblies are a stench to me.
AMO.5.22	Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings,
AMO.5.22	I will not accept them.
AMO.5.22	Though you bring choice fellowship offerings,
AMO.5.22	I will have no regard for them.
AMO.5.23	Away with the noise of your songs!
AMO.5.23	I will not listen to the music of your harps.
AMO.5.24	But let justice roll on like a river,
AMO.5.24	righteousness like a never-failing stream!
AMO.5.25	“Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings
AMO.5.25	forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?
AMO.5.26	You have lifted up the shrine of your king,
AMO.5.26	the pedestal of your idols,
AMO.5.26	the star of your god
AMO.5.26	which you made for yourselves.
AMO.5.27	Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,”
AMO.5.27	says the 
AMO.6.1	Woe to you who are complacent in Zion,
AMO.6.1	and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria,
AMO.6.1	you notable men of the foremost nation,
AMO.6.1	to whom the people of Israel come!
AMO.6.2	Go to Kalneh and look at it;
AMO.6.2	go from there to great Hamath,
AMO.6.2	and then go down to Gath in Philistia.
AMO.6.2	Are they better off than your two kingdoms?
AMO.6.2	Is their land larger than yours?
AMO.6.3	You put off the day of disaster
AMO.6.3	and bring near a reign of terror.
AMO.6.4	You lie on beds adorned with ivory
AMO.6.4	and lounge on your couches.
AMO.6.4	You dine on choice lambs
AMO.6.4	and fattened calves.
AMO.6.5	You strum away on your harps like David
AMO.6.5	and improvise on musical instruments.
AMO.6.6	You drink wine by the bowlful
AMO.6.6	and use the finest lotions,
AMO.6.6	but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
AMO.6.7	Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile;
AMO.6.7	your feasting and lounging will end.
AMO.6.8	The Sovereign 
AMO.6.8	“I abhor the pride of Jacob
AMO.6.8	and detest his fortresses;
AMO.6.8	I will deliver up the city
AMO.6.8	and everything in it.”
AMO.6.9	If ten people are left in one house, they too will die. 
AMO.6.10	And if the relative who comes to carry the bodies out of the house to burn them
AMO.6.11	For the 
AMO.6.11	and he will smash the great house into pieces
AMO.6.11	and the small house into bits.
AMO.6.12	Do horses run on the rocky crags?
AMO.6.12	Does one plow the sea
AMO.6.12	But you have turned justice into poison
AMO.6.12	and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness—
AMO.6.13	you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar
AMO.6.13	and say, “Did we not take Karnaim
AMO.6.14	For the 
AMO.6.14	“I will stir up a nation against you, Israel,
AMO.6.14	that will oppress you all the way
AMO.6.14	from Lebo Hamath to the valley of the Arabah.”
AMO.7.1	This is what the Sovereign 
AMO.7.2	When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, “Sovereign 
AMO.7.3	So the 
AMO.7.3	“This will not happen,” the 
AMO.7.4	This is what the Sovereign 
AMO.7.5	Then I cried out, “Sovereign 
AMO.7.6	So the 
AMO.7.6	“This will not happen either,” the Sovereign 
AMO.7.7	This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb,
AMO.7.8	And the 
AMO.7.8	“A plumb line,” I replied.
AMO.7.8	Then the Lord said, “Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.
AMO.7.9	“The high places of Isaac will be destroyed
AMO.7.9	and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined;
AMO.7.9	with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam.”
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: “Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words. 
AMO.7.11	For this is what Amos is saying:
AMO.7.11	“ ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword,
AMO.7.11	and Israel will surely go into exile,
AMO.7.11	away from their native land.’ ”
AMO.7.12	Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there. 
AMO.7.13	Don’t prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king’s sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom.”
AMO.7.14	Amos answered Amaziah, “I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees. 
AMO.7.15	But the 
AMO.7.16	Now then, hear the word of the 
AMO.7.16	“ ‘Do not prophesy against Israel,
AMO.7.16	and stop preaching against the descendants of Isaac.’
AMO.7.17	“Therefore this is what the 
AMO.7.17	“ ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city,
AMO.7.17	and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword.
AMO.7.17	Your land will be measured and divided up,
AMO.7.17	and you yourself will die in a pagan
AMO.7.17	And Israel will surely go into exile,
AMO.7.17	away from their native land.’ ”
AMO.8.1	This is what the Sovereign 
AMO.8.2	“What do you see, Amos?” he asked.
AMO.8.2	“A basket of ripe fruit,” I answered.
AMO.8.2	Then the 
AMO.8.3	“In that day,” declares the Sovereign 
AMO.8.4	Hear this, you who trample the needy
AMO.8.4	and do away with the poor of the land,
AMO.8.5	saying,
AMO.8.5	“When will the New Moon be over
AMO.8.5	that we may sell grain,
AMO.8.5	and the Sabbath be ended
AMO.8.5	that we may market wheat?”—
AMO.8.5	skimping on the measure,
AMO.8.5	boosting the price
AMO.8.5	and cheating with dishonest scales,
AMO.8.6	buying the poor with silver
AMO.8.6	and the needy for a pair of sandals,
AMO.8.6	selling even the sweepings with the wheat.
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.8	“Will not the land tremble for this,
AMO.8.8	and all who live in it mourn?
AMO.8.8	The whole land will rise like the Nile;
AMO.8.8	it will be stirred up and then sink
AMO.8.8	like the river of Egypt.
AMO.8.9	“In that day,” declares the Sovereign 
AMO.8.9	“I will make the sun go down at noon
AMO.8.9	and darken the earth in broad daylight.
AMO.8.10	I will turn your religious festivals into mourning
AMO.8.10	and all your singing into weeping.
AMO.8.10	I will make all of you wear sackcloth
AMO.8.10	and shave your heads.
AMO.8.10	I will make that time like mourning for an only son
AMO.8.10	and the end of it like a bitter day.
AMO.8.11	“The days are coming,” declares the Sovereign 
AMO.8.11	“when I will send a famine through the land—
AMO.8.11	not a famine of food or a thirst for water,
AMO.8.11	but a famine of hearing the words of the 
AMO.8.12	People will stagger from sea to sea
AMO.8.12	and wander from north to east,
AMO.8.12	searching for the word of the 
AMO.8.12	but they will not find it.
AMO.8.13	“In that day
AMO.8.13	“the lovely young women and strong young men
AMO.8.13	will faint because of thirst.
AMO.8.14	Those who swear by the sin of Samaria—
AMO.8.14	who say, ‘As surely as your god lives, Dan,’
AMO.8.14	or, ‘As surely as the god
AMO.8.14	they will fall, never to rise again.”
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said:
AMO.9.1	“Strike the tops of the pillars
AMO.9.1	so that the thresholds shake.
AMO.9.1	Bring them down on the heads of all the people;
AMO.9.1	those who are left I will kill with the sword.
AMO.9.1	Not one will get away,
AMO.9.1	none will escape.
AMO.9.2	Though they dig down to the depths below,
AMO.9.2	from there my hand will take them.
AMO.9.2	Though they climb up to the heavens above,
AMO.9.2	from there I will bring them down.
AMO.9.3	Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,
AMO.9.3	there I will hunt them down and seize them.
AMO.9.3	Though they hide from my eyes at the bottom of the sea,
AMO.9.3	there I will command the serpent to bite them.
AMO.9.4	Though they are driven into exile by their enemies,
AMO.9.4	there I will command the sword to slay them.
AMO.9.4	“I will keep my eye on them
AMO.9.4	for harm and not for good.”
AMO.9.5	The Lord, the 
AMO.9.5	he touches the earth and it melts,
AMO.9.5	and all who live in it mourn;
AMO.9.5	the whole land rises like the Nile,
AMO.9.5	then sinks like the river of Egypt;
AMO.9.6	he builds his lofty palace
AMO.9.6	and sets its foundation
AMO.9.6	he calls for the waters of the sea
AMO.9.6	and pours them out over the face of the land—
AMO.9.6	the 
AMO.9.7	“Are not you Israelites
AMO.9.7	the same to me as the Cushites
AMO.9.7	declares the 
AMO.9.7	“Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt,
AMO.9.7	the Philistines from Caphtor
AMO.9.7	and the Arameans from Kir?
AMO.9.8	“Surely the eyes of the Sovereign 
AMO.9.8	are on the sinful kingdom.
AMO.9.8	I will destroy it
AMO.9.8	from the face of the earth.
AMO.9.8	Yet I will not totally destroy
AMO.9.8	the descendants of Jacob,”
AMO.9.8	declares the 
AMO.9.9	“For I will give the command,
AMO.9.9	and I will shake the people of Israel
AMO.9.9	among all the nations
AMO.9.9	as grain is shaken in a sieve,
AMO.9.9	and not a pebble will reach the ground.
AMO.9.10	All the sinners among my people
AMO.9.10	will die by the sword,
AMO.9.10	all those who say,
AMO.9.10	‘Disaster will not overtake or meet us.’
AMO.9.11	“In that day
AMO.9.11	“I will restore David’s fallen shelter—
AMO.9.11	I will repair its broken walls
AMO.9.11	and restore its ruins—
AMO.9.11	and will rebuild it as it used to be,
AMO.9.12	so that they may possess the remnant of Edom
AMO.9.12	and all the nations that bear my name,
AMO.9.12	declares the 
AMO.9.13	“The days are coming,” declares the 
AMO.9.13	“when the reaper will be overtaken by the plowman
AMO.9.13	and the planter by the one treading grapes.
AMO.9.13	New wine will drip from the mountains
AMO.9.13	and flow from all the hills,
AMO.9.14	and I will bring my people Israel back from exile.
AMO.9.14	“They will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them.
AMO.9.14	They will plant vineyards and drink their wine;
AMO.9.14	they will make gardens and eat their fruit.
AMO.9.15	I will plant Israel in their own land,
AMO.9.15	never again to be uprooted
AMO.9.15	from the land I have given them,”
AMO.9.15	says the 
OBA.1.1	The vision of Obadiah.
OBA.1.1	This is what the Sovereign 
OBA.1.1	We have heard a message from the 
OBA.1.1	An envoy was sent to the nations to say,
OBA.1.1	“Rise, let us go against her for battle”—
OBA.1.2	“See, I will make you small among the nations;
OBA.1.2	you will be utterly despised.
OBA.1.3	The pride of your heart has deceived you,
OBA.1.3	you who live in the clefts of the rocks
OBA.1.3	and make your home on the heights,
OBA.1.3	you who say to yourself,
OBA.1.3	‘Who can bring me down to the ground?’
OBA.1.4	Though you soar like the eagle
OBA.1.4	and make your nest among the stars,
OBA.1.4	from there I will bring you down,”
OBA.1.4	declares the 
OBA.1.5	“If thieves came to you,
OBA.1.5	if robbers in the night—
OBA.1.5	oh, what a disaster awaits you!—
OBA.1.5	would they not steal only as much as they wanted?
OBA.1.5	If grape pickers came to you,
OBA.1.5	would they not leave a few grapes?
OBA.1.6	But how Esau will be ransacked,
OBA.1.6	his hidden treasures pillaged!
OBA.1.7	All your allies will force you to the border;
OBA.1.7	your friends will deceive and overpower you;
OBA.1.7	those who eat your bread will set a trap for you,
OBA.1.7	but you will not detect it.
OBA.1.8	“In that day,” declares the 
OBA.1.8	“will I not destroy the wise men of Edom,
OBA.1.8	those of understanding in the mountains of Esau?
OBA.1.9	Your warriors, Teman, will be terrified,
OBA.1.9	and everyone in Esau’s mountains
OBA.1.9	will be cut down in the slaughter.
OBA.1.10	Because of the violence against your brother Jacob,
OBA.1.10	you will be covered with shame;
OBA.1.10	you will be destroyed forever.
OBA.1.11	On the day you stood aloof
OBA.1.11	while strangers carried off his wealth
OBA.1.11	and foreigners entered his gates
OBA.1.11	and cast lots for Jerusalem,
OBA.1.11	you were like one of them.
OBA.1.12	You should not gloat over your brother
OBA.1.12	in the day of his misfortune,
OBA.1.12	nor rejoice over the people of Judah
OBA.1.12	in the day of their destruction,
OBA.1.12	nor boast so much
OBA.1.12	in the day of their trouble.
OBA.1.13	You should not march through the gates of my people
OBA.1.13	in the day of their disaster,
OBA.1.13	nor gloat over them in their calamity
OBA.1.13	in the day of their disaster,
OBA.1.13	nor seize their wealth
OBA.1.13	in the day of their disaster.
OBA.1.14	You should not wait at the crossroads
OBA.1.14	to cut down their fugitives,
OBA.1.14	nor hand over their survivors
OBA.1.14	in the day of their trouble.
OBA.1.15	“The day of the 
OBA.1.15	for all nations.
OBA.1.15	As you have done, it will be done to you;
OBA.1.15	your deeds will return upon your own head.
OBA.1.16	Just as you drank on my holy hill,
OBA.1.16	so all the nations will drink continually;
OBA.1.16	they will drink and drink
OBA.1.16	and be as if they had never been.
OBA.1.17	But on Mount Zion will be deliverance;
OBA.1.17	it will be holy,
OBA.1.17	and Jacob will possess his inheritance.
OBA.1.18	Jacob will be a fire
OBA.1.18	and Joseph a flame;
OBA.1.18	Esau will be stubble,
OBA.1.18	and they will set him on fire and destroy him.
OBA.1.18	There will be no survivors
OBA.1.18	from Esau.”
OBA.1.18	The 
OBA.1.19	People from the Negev will occupy
OBA.1.19	the mountains of Esau,
OBA.1.19	and people from the foothills will possess
OBA.1.19	the land of the Philistines.
OBA.1.19	They will occupy the fields of Ephraim and Samaria,
OBA.1.19	and Benjamin will possess Gilead.
OBA.1.20	This company of Israelite exiles who are in Canaan
OBA.1.20	will possess the land as far as Zarephath;
OBA.1.20	the exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad
OBA.1.20	will possess the towns of the Negev.
OBA.1.21	Deliverers will go up on
OBA.1.21	to govern the mountains of Esau.

JON.1.1	The word of the 
JON.1.2	“Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me.”
JON.1.3	But Jonah ran away from the 
JON.1.4	Then the 
JON.1.5	All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship.
JON.1.5	But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep. 
JON.1.6	The captain went to him and said, “How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us so that we will not perish.”
JON.1.7	Then the sailors said to each other, “Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity.” They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah. 
JON.1.8	So they asked him, “Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us? What kind of work do you do? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?”
JON.1.9	He answered, “I am a Hebrew and I worship the 
JON.1.10	This terrified them and they asked, “What have you done?” (They knew he was running away from the 
JON.1.11	The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, “What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?”
JON.1.12	“Pick me up and throw me into the sea,” he replied, “and it will become calm. I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you.”
JON.1.13	Instead, the men did their best to row back to land. But they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before. 
JON.1.14	Then they cried out to the 
JON.1.15	Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm. 
JON.1.16	At this the men greatly feared the 
JON.1.17	Now the 
JON.2.1	From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the 
JON.2.2	He said:
JON.2.2	“In my distress I called to the 
JON.2.2	and he answered me.
JON.2.2	From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help,
JON.2.2	and you listened to my cry.
JON.2.3	You hurled me into the depths,
JON.2.3	into the very heart of the seas,
JON.2.3	and the currents swirled about me;
JON.2.3	all your waves and breakers
JON.2.3	swept over me.
JON.2.4	I said, ‘I have been banished
JON.2.4	from your sight;
JON.2.4	yet I will look again
JON.2.4	toward your holy temple.’
JON.2.5	The engulfing waters threatened me,
JON.2.5	the deep surrounded me;
JON.2.5	seaweed was wrapped around my head.
JON.2.6	To the roots of the mountains I sank down;
JON.2.6	the earth beneath barred me in forever.
JON.2.6	But you, 
JON.2.6	brought my life up from the pit.
JON.2.7	“When my life was ebbing away,
JON.2.7	I remembered you, 
JON.2.7	and my prayer rose to you,
JON.2.7	to your holy temple.
JON.2.8	“Those who cling to worthless idols
JON.2.8	turn away from God’s love for them.
JON.2.9	But I, with shouts of grateful praise,
JON.2.9	will sacrifice to you.
JON.2.9	What I have vowed I will make good.
JON.2.9	I will say, ‘Salvation comes from the 
JON.2.10	And the 
JON.3.1	Then the word of the 
JON.3.2	“Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.”
JON.3.3	Jonah obeyed the word of the 
JON.3.4	Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming, “Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.” 
JON.3.5	The Ninevites believed God. A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.
JON.3.6	When Jonah’s warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust. 
JON.3.7	This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh:
JON.3.7	“By the decree of the king and his nobles:
JON.3.7	Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. 
JON.3.8	But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence. 
JON.3.9	Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.”
JON.3.10	When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened.
JON.4.1	But to Jonah this seemed very wrong, and he became angry. 
JON.4.2	He prayed to the 
JON.4.3	Now, 
JON.4.4	But the 
JON.4.5	Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city. 
JON.4.6	Then the 
JON.4.7	But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered. 
JON.4.8	When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah’s head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, “It would be better for me to die than to live.”
JON.4.9	But God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?”
JON.4.9	“It is,” he said. “And I’m so angry I wish I were dead.”
JON.4.10	But the 
JON.4.11	And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—and also many animals?”
MIC.1.1	The word of the 
MIC.1.2	Hear, you peoples, all of you,
MIC.1.2	listen, earth and all who live in it,
MIC.1.2	that the Sovereign 
MIC.1.2	the Lord from his holy temple.
MIC.1.3	Look! The 
MIC.1.3	he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth.
MIC.1.4	The mountains melt beneath him
MIC.1.4	and the valleys split apart,
MIC.1.4	like wax before the fire,
MIC.1.4	like water rushing down a slope.
MIC.1.5	All this is because of Jacob’s transgression,
MIC.1.5	because of the sins of the people of Israel.
MIC.1.5	What is Jacob’s transgression?
MIC.1.5	Is it not Samaria?
MIC.1.5	What is Judah’s high place?
MIC.1.5	Is it not Jerusalem?
MIC.1.6	“Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble,
MIC.1.6	a place for planting vineyards.
MIC.1.6	I will pour her stones into the valley
MIC.1.6	and lay bare her foundations.
MIC.1.7	All her idols will be broken to pieces;
MIC.1.7	all her temple gifts will be burned with fire;
MIC.1.7	I will destroy all her images.
MIC.1.7	Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes,
MIC.1.7	as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used.”
MIC.1.8	Because of this I will weep and wail;
MIC.1.8	I will go about barefoot and naked.
MIC.1.8	I will howl like a jackal
MIC.1.8	and moan like an owl.
MIC.1.9	For Samaria’s plague is incurable;
MIC.1.9	it has spread to Judah.
MIC.1.9	It has reached the very gate of my people,
MIC.1.9	even to Jerusalem itself.
MIC.1.10	Tell it not in Gath
MIC.1.10	weep not at all.
MIC.1.10	In Beth Ophrah
MIC.1.10	roll in the dust.
MIC.1.11	Pass by naked and in shame,
MIC.1.11	you who live in Shaphir.
MIC.1.11	Those who live in Zaanan
MIC.1.11	will not come out.
MIC.1.11	Beth Ezel is in mourning;
MIC.1.11	it no longer protects you.
MIC.1.12	Those who live in Maroth
MIC.1.12	waiting for relief,
MIC.1.12	because disaster has come from the 
MIC.1.12	even to the gate of Jerusalem.
MIC.1.13	You who live in Lachish,
MIC.1.13	harness fast horses to the chariot.
MIC.1.13	You are where the sin of Daughter Zion began,
MIC.1.13	for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
MIC.1.14	Therefore you will give parting gifts
MIC.1.14	to Moresheth Gath.
MIC.1.14	The town of Akzib
MIC.1.14	to the kings of Israel.
MIC.1.15	I will bring a conqueror against you
MIC.1.15	who live in Mareshah.
MIC.1.15	The nobles of Israel
MIC.1.15	will flee to Adullam.
MIC.1.16	Shave your head in mourning
MIC.1.16	for the children in whom you delight;
MIC.1.16	make yourself as bald as the vulture,
MIC.1.16	for they will go from you into exile.
MIC.2.1	Woe to those who plan iniquity,
MIC.2.1	to those who plot evil on their beds!
MIC.2.1	At morning’s light they carry it out
MIC.2.1	because it is in their power to do it.
MIC.2.2	They covet fields and seize them,
MIC.2.2	and houses, and take them.
MIC.2.2	They defraud people of their homes,
MIC.2.2	they rob them of their inheritance.
MIC.2.3	Therefore, the 
MIC.2.3	“I am planning disaster against this people,
MIC.2.3	from which you cannot save yourselves.
MIC.2.3	You will no longer walk proudly,
MIC.2.3	for it will be a time of calamity.
MIC.2.4	In that day people will ridicule you;
MIC.2.4	they will taunt you with this mournful song:
MIC.2.4	‘We are utterly ruined;
MIC.2.4	my people’s possession is divided up.
MIC.2.4	He takes it from me!
MIC.2.4	He assigns our fields to traitors.’ ”
MIC.2.5	Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the 
MIC.2.5	to divide the land by lot.
MIC.2.6	“Do not prophesy,” their prophets say.
MIC.2.6	“Do not prophesy about these things;
MIC.2.6	disgrace will not overtake us.”
MIC.2.7	You descendants of Jacob, should it be said,
MIC.2.7	“Does the 
MIC.2.7	Does he do such things?”
MIC.2.7	“Do not my words do good
MIC.2.7	to the one whose ways are upright?
MIC.2.8	Lately my people have risen up
MIC.2.8	like an enemy.
MIC.2.8	You strip off the rich robe
MIC.2.8	from those who pass by without a care,
MIC.2.8	like men returning from battle.
MIC.2.9	You drive the women of my people
MIC.2.9	from their pleasant homes.
MIC.2.9	You take away my blessing
MIC.2.9	from their children forever.
MIC.2.10	Get up, go away!
MIC.2.10	For this is not your resting place,
MIC.2.10	because it is defiled,
MIC.2.10	it is ruined, beyond all remedy.
MIC.2.11	If a liar and deceiver comes and says,
MIC.2.11	‘I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,’
MIC.2.11	that would be just the prophet for this people!
MIC.2.12	“I will surely gather all of you, Jacob;
MIC.2.12	I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel.
MIC.2.12	I will bring them together like sheep in a pen,
MIC.2.12	like a flock in its pasture;
MIC.2.12	the place will throng with people.
MIC.2.13	The One who breaks open the way will go up before them;
MIC.2.13	they will break through the gate and go out.
MIC.2.13	Their King will pass through before them,
MIC.2.13	the 
MIC.3.1	Then I said,
MIC.3.1	“Listen, you leaders of Jacob,
MIC.3.1	you rulers of Israel.
MIC.3.1	Should you not embrace justice,
MIC.3.2	you who hate good and love evil;
MIC.3.2	who tear the skin from my people
MIC.3.2	and the flesh from their bones;
MIC.3.3	who eat my people’s flesh,
MIC.3.3	strip off their skin
MIC.3.3	and break their bones in pieces;
MIC.3.3	who chop them up like meat for the pan,
MIC.3.3	like flesh for the pot?”
MIC.3.4	Then they will cry out to the 
MIC.3.4	but he will not answer them.
MIC.3.4	At that time he will hide his face from them
MIC.3.4	because of the evil they have done.
MIC.3.5	This is what the 
MIC.3.5	“As for the prophets
MIC.3.5	who lead my people astray,
MIC.3.5	they proclaim ‘peace’
MIC.3.5	if they have something to eat,
MIC.3.5	but prepare to wage war against anyone
MIC.3.5	who refuses to feed them.
MIC.3.6	Therefore night will come over you, without visions,
MIC.3.6	and darkness, without divination.
MIC.3.6	The sun will set for the prophets,
MIC.3.6	and the day will go dark for them.
MIC.3.7	The seers will be ashamed
MIC.3.7	and the diviners disgraced.
MIC.3.7	They will all cover their faces
MIC.3.7	because there is no answer from God.”
MIC.3.8	But as for me, I am filled with power,
MIC.3.8	with the Spirit of the 
MIC.3.8	and with justice and might,
MIC.3.8	to declare to Jacob his transgression,
MIC.3.8	to Israel his sin.
MIC.3.9	Hear this, you leaders of Jacob,
MIC.3.9	you rulers of Israel,
MIC.3.9	who despise justice
MIC.3.9	and distort all that is right;
MIC.3.10	who build Zion with bloodshed,
MIC.3.10	and Jerusalem with wickedness.
MIC.3.11	Her leaders judge for a bribe,
MIC.3.11	her priests teach for a price,
MIC.3.11	and her prophets tell fortunes for money.
MIC.3.11	Yet they look for the 
MIC.3.11	“Is not the 
MIC.3.11	No disaster will come upon us.”
MIC.3.12	Therefore because of you,
MIC.3.12	Zion will be plowed like a field,
MIC.3.12	Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,
MIC.3.12	the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.
MIC.4.1	In the last days
MIC.4.1	the mountain of the 
MIC.4.1	as the highest of the mountains;
MIC.4.1	it will be exalted above the hills,
MIC.4.1	and peoples will stream to it.
MIC.4.2	Many nations will come and say,
MIC.4.2	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the 
MIC.4.2	to the temple of the God of Jacob.
MIC.4.2	He will teach us his ways,
MIC.4.2	so that we may walk in his paths.”
MIC.4.2	The law will go out from Zion,
MIC.4.2	the word of the 
MIC.4.3	He will judge between many peoples
MIC.4.3	and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide.
MIC.4.3	They will beat their swords into plowshares
MIC.4.3	and their spears into pruning hooks.
MIC.4.3	Nation will not take up sword against nation,
MIC.4.3	nor will they train for war anymore.
MIC.4.4	Everyone will sit under their own vine
MIC.4.4	and under their own fig tree,
MIC.4.4	and no one will make them afraid,
MIC.4.4	for the 
MIC.4.5	All the nations may walk
MIC.4.5	in the name of their gods,
MIC.4.5	but we will walk in the name of the 
MIC.4.5	our God for ever and ever.
MIC.4.6	“In that day,” declares the 
MIC.4.6	“I will gather the lame;
MIC.4.6	I will assemble the exiles
MIC.4.6	and those I have brought to grief.
MIC.4.7	I will make the lame my remnant,
MIC.4.7	those driven away a strong nation.
MIC.4.7	The 
MIC.4.7	from that day and forever.
MIC.4.8	As for you, watchtower of the flock,
MIC.4.8	stronghold
MIC.4.8	the former dominion will be restored to you;
MIC.4.8	kingship will come to Daughter Jerusalem.”
MIC.4.9	Why do you now cry aloud—
MIC.4.9	have you no king
MIC.4.9	Has your ruler
MIC.4.9	that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor?
MIC.4.10	Writhe in agony, Daughter Zion,
MIC.4.10	like a woman in labor,
MIC.4.10	for now you must leave the city
MIC.4.10	to camp in the open field.
MIC.4.10	You will go to Babylon;
MIC.4.10	there you will be rescued.
MIC.4.10	There the 
MIC.4.10	out of the hand of your enemies.
MIC.4.11	But now many nations
MIC.4.11	are gathered against you.
MIC.4.11	They say, “Let her be defiled,
MIC.4.11	let our eyes gloat over Zion!”
MIC.4.12	But they do not know
MIC.4.12	the thoughts of the 
MIC.4.12	they do not understand his plan,
MIC.4.12	that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
MIC.4.13	“Rise and thresh, Daughter Zion,
MIC.4.13	for I will give you horns of iron;
MIC.4.13	I will give you hooves of bronze,
MIC.4.13	and you will break to pieces many nations.”
MIC.4.13	You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the 
MIC.4.13	their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
MIC.5.1	Marshal your troops now, city of troops,
MIC.5.1	for a siege is laid against us.
MIC.5.1	They will strike Israel’s ruler
MIC.5.1	on the cheek with a rod.
MIC.5.2	“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
MIC.5.2	though you are small among the clans
MIC.5.2	out of you will come for me
MIC.5.2	one who will be ruler over Israel,
MIC.5.2	whose origins are from of old,
MIC.5.2	from ancient times.”
MIC.5.3	Therefore Israel will be abandoned
MIC.5.3	until the time when she who is in labor bears a son,
MIC.5.3	and the rest of his brothers return
MIC.5.3	to join the Israelites.
MIC.5.4	He will stand and shepherd his flock
MIC.5.4	in the strength of the 
MIC.5.4	in the majesty of the name of the 
MIC.5.4	And they will live securely, for then his greatness
MIC.5.4	will reach to the ends of the earth.
MIC.5.5	And he will be our peace
MIC.5.5	when the Assyrians invade our land
MIC.5.5	and march through our fortresses.
MIC.5.5	We will raise against them seven shepherds,
MIC.5.5	even eight commanders,
MIC.5.6	who will rule
MIC.5.6	the land of Nimrod with drawn sword.
MIC.5.6	He will deliver us from the Assyrians
MIC.5.6	when they invade our land
MIC.5.6	and march across our borders.
MIC.5.7	The remnant of Jacob will be
MIC.5.7	in the midst of many peoples
MIC.5.7	like dew from the 
MIC.5.7	like showers on the grass,
MIC.5.7	which do not wait for anyone
MIC.5.7	or depend on man.
MIC.5.8	The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations,
MIC.5.8	in the midst of many peoples,
MIC.5.8	like a lion among the beasts of the forest,
MIC.5.8	like a young lion among flocks of sheep,
MIC.5.8	which mauls and mangles as it goes,
MIC.5.8	and no one can rescue.
MIC.5.9	Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies,
MIC.5.9	and all your foes will be destroyed.
MIC.5.10	“In that day,” declares the 
MIC.5.10	“I will destroy your horses from among you
MIC.5.10	and demolish your chariots.
MIC.5.11	I will destroy the cities of your land
MIC.5.11	and tear down all your strongholds.
MIC.5.12	I will destroy your witchcraft
MIC.5.12	and you will no longer cast spells.
MIC.5.13	I will destroy your idols
MIC.5.13	and your sacred stones from among you;
MIC.5.13	you will no longer bow down
MIC.5.13	to the work of your hands.
MIC.5.14	I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles
MIC.5.14	when I demolish your cities.
MIC.5.15	I will take vengeance in anger and wrath
MIC.5.15	on the nations that have not obeyed me.”
MIC.6.1	Listen to what the 
MIC.6.1	“Stand up, plead my case before the mountains;
MIC.6.1	let the hills hear what you have to say.
MIC.6.2	“Hear, you mountains, the 
MIC.6.2	listen, you everlasting foundations of the earth.
MIC.6.2	For the 
MIC.6.2	he is lodging a charge against Israel.
MIC.6.3	“My people, what have I done to you?
MIC.6.3	How have I burdened you? Answer me.
MIC.6.4	I brought you up out of Egypt
MIC.6.4	and redeemed you from the land of slavery.
MIC.6.4	I sent Moses to lead you,
MIC.6.4	also Aaron and Miriam.
MIC.6.5	My people, remember
MIC.6.5	what Balak king of Moab plotted
MIC.6.5	and what Balaam son of Beor answered.
MIC.6.5	Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal,
MIC.6.5	that you may know the righteous acts of the 
MIC.6.6	With what shall I come before the 
MIC.6.6	and bow down before the exalted God?
MIC.6.6	Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
MIC.6.6	with calves a year old?
MIC.6.7	Will the 
MIC.6.7	with ten thousand rivers of olive oil?
MIC.6.7	Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression,
MIC.6.7	the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
MIC.6.8	He has shown you, O mortal, what is good.
MIC.6.8	And what does the 
MIC.6.8	To act justly and to love mercy
MIC.6.8	and to walk humbly
MIC.6.9	Listen! The 
MIC.6.9	and to fear your name is wisdom—
MIC.6.9	“Heed the rod and the One who appointed it.
MIC.6.10	Am I still to forget your ill-gotten treasures, you wicked house,
MIC.6.10	and the short ephah,
MIC.6.11	Shall I acquit someone with dishonest scales,
MIC.6.11	with a bag of false weights?
MIC.6.12	Your rich people are violent;
MIC.6.12	your inhabitants are liars
MIC.6.12	and their tongues speak deceitfully.
MIC.6.13	Therefore, I have begun to destroy you,
MIC.6.13	to ruin
MIC.6.14	You will eat but not be satisfied;
MIC.6.14	your stomach will still be empty.
MIC.6.14	You will store up but save nothing,
MIC.6.14	because what you save
MIC.6.15	You will plant but not harvest;
MIC.6.15	you will press olives but not use the oil,
MIC.6.15	you will crush grapes but not drink the wine.
MIC.6.16	You have observed the statutes of Omri
MIC.6.16	and all the practices of Ahab’s house;
MIC.6.16	you have followed their traditions.
MIC.6.16	Therefore I will give you over to ruin
MIC.6.16	and your people to derision;
MIC.6.16	you will bear the scorn of the nations.
MIC.7.1	What misery is mine!
MIC.7.1	I am like one who gathers summer fruit
MIC.7.1	at the gleaning of the vineyard;
MIC.7.1	there is no cluster of grapes to eat,
MIC.7.1	none of the early figs that I crave.
MIC.7.2	The faithful have been swept from the land;
MIC.7.2	not one upright person remains.
MIC.7.2	Everyone lies in wait to shed blood;
MIC.7.2	they hunt each other with nets.
MIC.7.3	Both hands are skilled in doing evil;
MIC.7.3	the ruler demands gifts,
MIC.7.3	the judge accepts bribes,
MIC.7.3	the powerful dictate what they desire—
MIC.7.3	they all conspire together.
MIC.7.4	The best of them is like a brier,
MIC.7.4	the most upright worse than a thorn hedge.
MIC.7.4	The day God visits you has come,
MIC.7.4	the day your watchmen sound the alarm.
MIC.7.4	Now is the time of your confusion.
MIC.7.5	Do not trust a neighbor;
MIC.7.5	put no confidence in a friend.
MIC.7.5	Even with the woman who lies in your embrace
MIC.7.5	guard the words of your lips.
MIC.7.6	For a son dishonors his father,
MIC.7.6	a daughter rises up against her mother,
MIC.7.6	a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—
MIC.7.6	a man’s enemies are the members of his own household.
MIC.7.7	But as for me, I watch in hope for the 
MIC.7.7	I wait for God my Savior;
MIC.7.7	my God will hear me.
MIC.7.8	Do not gloat over me, my enemy!
MIC.7.8	Though I have fallen, I will rise.
MIC.7.8	Though I sit in darkness,
MIC.7.8	the 
MIC.7.9	Because I have sinned against him,
MIC.7.9	I will bear the 
MIC.7.9	until he pleads my case
MIC.7.9	and upholds my cause.
MIC.7.9	He will bring me out into the light;
MIC.7.9	I will see his righteousness.
MIC.7.10	Then my enemy will see it
MIC.7.10	and will be covered with shame,
MIC.7.10	she who said to me,
MIC.7.10	“Where is the 
MIC.7.10	My eyes will see her downfall;
MIC.7.10	even now she will be trampled underfoot
MIC.7.10	like mire in the streets.
MIC.7.11	The day for building your walls will come,
MIC.7.11	the day for extending your boundaries.
MIC.7.12	In that day people will come to you
MIC.7.12	from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
MIC.7.12	even from Egypt to the Euphrates
MIC.7.12	and from sea to sea
MIC.7.12	and from mountain to mountain.
MIC.7.13	The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants,
MIC.7.13	as the result of their deeds.
MIC.7.14	Shepherd your people with your staff,
MIC.7.14	the flock of your inheritance,
MIC.7.14	which lives by itself in a forest,
MIC.7.14	in fertile pasturelands.
MIC.7.14	Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead
MIC.7.14	as in days long ago.
MIC.7.15	“As in the days when you came out of Egypt,
MIC.7.15	I will show them my wonders.”
MIC.7.16	Nations will see and be ashamed,
MIC.7.16	deprived of all their power.
MIC.7.16	They will put their hands over their mouths
MIC.7.16	and their ears will become deaf.
MIC.7.17	They will lick dust like a snake,
MIC.7.17	like creatures that crawl on the ground.
MIC.7.17	They will come trembling out of their dens;
MIC.7.17	they will turn in fear to the 
MIC.7.17	and will be afraid of you.
MIC.7.18	Who is a God like you,
MIC.7.18	who pardons sin and forgives the transgression
MIC.7.18	of the remnant of his inheritance?
MIC.7.18	You do not stay angry forever
MIC.7.18	but delight to show mercy.
MIC.7.19	You will again have compassion on us;
MIC.7.19	you will tread our sins underfoot
MIC.7.19	and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.
MIC.7.20	You will be faithful to Jacob,
MIC.7.20	and show love to Abraham,
MIC.7.20	as you pledged on oath to our ancestors
MIC.7.20	in days long ago.

NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.3	the 
NAM.1.3	His way is in the whirlwind and the storm,
NAM.1.3	and clouds are the dust of his feet.
NAM.1.4	He rebukes the sea and dries it up;
NAM.1.4	he makes all the rivers run dry.
NAM.1.4	Bashan and Carmel wither
NAM.1.4	and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.
NAM.1.5	The mountains quake before him
NAM.1.5	and the hills melt away.
NAM.1.5	The earth trembles at his presence,
NAM.1.5	the world and all who live in it.
NAM.1.6	Who can withstand his indignation?
NAM.1.6	Who can endure his fierce anger?
NAM.1.6	His wrath is poured out like fire;
NAM.1.6	the rocks are shattered before him.
NAM.1.7	The

NAM.1.7	He cares for those who trust in him,
NAM.1.8	but with an overwhelming flood
NAM.1.8	he will make an end of Nineveh;
NAM.1.8	he will pursue his foes into the realm of darkness.
NAM.1.9	Whatever they plot against the 
NAM.1.9	he will bring
NAM.1.9	trouble will not come a second time.
NAM.1.10	They will be entangled among thorns
NAM.1.10	and drunk from their wine;
NAM.1.10	they will be consumed like dry stubble.
NAM.1.11	From you, Nineveh, has one come forth
NAM.1.11	who plots evil against the 
NAM.1.11	and devises wicked plans.
NAM.1.12	This is what the 
NAM.1.12	“Although they have allies and are numerous,
NAM.1.12	they will be destroyed and pass away.
NAM.1.12	Although I have afflicted you, Judah,
NAM.1.12	I will afflict you no more.
NAM.1.13	Now I will break their yoke from your neck
NAM.1.13	and tear your shackles away.”
NAM.1.14	The 
NAM.1.14	“You will have no descendants to bear your name.
NAM.1.14	I will destroy the images and idols
NAM.1.14	that are in the temple of your gods.
NAM.1.14	I will prepare your grave,
NAM.1.14	for you are vile.”
NAM.1.15	Look, there on the mountains,
NAM.1.15	the feet of one who brings good news,
NAM.1.15	who proclaims peace!
NAM.1.15	Celebrate your festivals, Judah,
NAM.1.15	and fulfill your vows.
NAM.1.15	No more will the wicked invade you;
NAM.1.15	they will be completely destroyed.
NAM.2.1	An attacker advances against you, Nineveh.
NAM.2.1	Guard the fortress,
NAM.2.1	watch the road,
NAM.2.1	brace yourselves,
NAM.2.1	marshal all your strength!
NAM.2.2	The 
NAM.2.2	like the splendor of Israel,
NAM.2.2	though destroyers have laid them waste
NAM.2.2	and have ruined their vines.
NAM.2.3	The shields of the soldiers are red;
NAM.2.3	the warriors are clad in scarlet.
NAM.2.3	The metal on the chariots flashes
NAM.2.3	on the day they are made ready;
NAM.2.3	the spears of juniper are brandished.
NAM.2.4	The chariots storm through the streets,
NAM.2.4	rushing back and forth through the squares.
NAM.2.4	They look like flaming torches;
NAM.2.4	they dart about like lightning.
NAM.2.5	Nineveh summons her picked troops,
NAM.2.5	yet they stumble on their way.
NAM.2.5	They dash to the city wall;
NAM.2.5	the protective shield is put in place.
NAM.2.6	The river gates are thrown open
NAM.2.6	and the palace collapses.
NAM.2.7	It is decreed
NAM.2.7	be exiled and carried away.
NAM.2.7	Her female slaves moan like doves
NAM.2.7	and beat on their breasts.
NAM.2.8	Nineveh is like a pool
NAM.2.8	whose water is draining away.
NAM.2.8	“Stop! Stop!” they cry,
NAM.2.8	but no one turns back.
NAM.2.9	Plunder the silver!
NAM.2.9	Plunder the gold!
NAM.2.9	The supply is endless,
NAM.2.9	the wealth from all its treasures!
NAM.2.10	She is pillaged, plundered, stripped!
NAM.2.10	Hearts melt, knees give way,
NAM.2.10	bodies tremble, every face grows pale.
NAM.2.11	Where now is the lions’ den,
NAM.2.11	the place where they fed their young,
NAM.2.11	where the lion and lioness went,
NAM.2.11	and the cubs, with nothing to fear?
NAM.2.12	The lion killed enough for his cubs
NAM.2.12	and strangled the prey for his mate,
NAM.2.12	filling his lairs with the kill
NAM.2.12	and his dens with the prey.
NAM.2.13	“I am against you,”
NAM.2.13	declares the 
NAM.2.13	“I will burn up your chariots in smoke,
NAM.2.13	and the sword will devour your young lions.
NAM.2.13	I will leave you no prey on the earth.
NAM.2.13	The voices of your messengers
NAM.2.13	will no longer be heard.”
NAM.3.1	Woe to the city of blood,
NAM.3.1	full of lies,
NAM.3.1	full of plunder,
NAM.3.1	never without victims!
NAM.3.2	The crack of whips,
NAM.3.2	the clatter of wheels,
NAM.3.2	galloping horses
NAM.3.2	and jolting chariots!
NAM.3.3	Charging cavalry,
NAM.3.3	flashing swords
NAM.3.3	and glittering spears!
NAM.3.3	Many casualties,
NAM.3.3	piles of dead,

NAM.3.3	people stumbling over the corpses—
NAM.3.4	all because of the wanton lust of a prostitute,
NAM.3.4	alluring, the mistress of sorceries,
NAM.3.4	who enslaved nations by her prostitution
NAM.3.4	and peoples by her witchcraft.
NAM.3.5	“I am against you,” declares the 
NAM.3.5	“I will lift your skirts over your face.
NAM.3.5	I will show the nations your nakedness
NAM.3.5	and the kingdoms your shame.
NAM.3.6	I will pelt you with filth,
NAM.3.6	I will treat you with contempt
NAM.3.6	and make you a spectacle.
NAM.3.7	All who see you will flee from you and say,
NAM.3.7	‘Nineveh is in ruins—who will mourn for her?’
NAM.3.7	Where can I find anyone to comfort you?”
NAM.3.8	Are you better than Thebes,
NAM.3.8	situated on the Nile,
NAM.3.8	with water around her?
NAM.3.8	The river was her defense,
NAM.3.8	the waters her wall.
NAM.3.9	Cush
NAM.3.9	Put and Libya were among her allies.
NAM.3.10	Yet she was taken captive
NAM.3.10	and went into exile.
NAM.3.10	Her infants were dashed to pieces
NAM.3.10	at every street corner.
NAM.3.10	Lots were cast for her nobles,
NAM.3.10	and all her great men were put in chains.
NAM.3.11	You too will become drunk;
NAM.3.11	you will go into hiding
NAM.3.11	and seek refuge from the enemy.
NAM.3.12	All your fortresses are like fig trees
NAM.3.12	with their first ripe fruit;
NAM.3.12	when they are shaken,
NAM.3.12	the figs fall into the mouth of the eater.
NAM.3.13	Look at your troops—
NAM.3.13	they are all weaklings.
NAM.3.13	The gates of your land
NAM.3.13	are wide open to your enemies;
NAM.3.13	fire has consumed the bars of your gates.
NAM.3.14	Draw water for the siege,
NAM.3.14	strengthen your defenses!
NAM.3.14	Work the clay,
NAM.3.14	tread the mortar,
NAM.3.14	repair the brickwork!
NAM.3.15	There the fire will consume you;
NAM.3.15	the sword will cut you down—
NAM.3.15	they will devour you like a swarm of locusts.
NAM.3.15	Multiply like grasshoppers,
NAM.3.15	multiply like locusts!
NAM.3.16	You have increased the number of your merchants
NAM.3.16	till they are more numerous than the stars in the sky,
NAM.3.16	but like locusts they strip the land
NAM.3.16	and then fly away.
NAM.3.17	Your guards are like locusts,
NAM.3.17	your officials like swarms of locusts
NAM.3.17	that settle in the walls on a cold day—
NAM.3.17	but when the sun appears they fly away,
NAM.3.17	and no one knows where.
NAM.3.18	King of Assyria, your shepherds
NAM.3.18	your nobles lie down to rest.
NAM.3.18	Your people are scattered on the mountains
NAM.3.18	with no one to gather them.
NAM.3.19	Nothing can heal you;
NAM.3.19	your wound is fatal.
NAM.3.19	All who hear the news about you
NAM.3.19	clap their hands at your fall,
NAM.3.19	for who has not felt
NAM.3.19	your endless cruelty?
HAB.1.1	The prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet received.
HAB.1.2	How long, 
HAB.1.2	but you do not listen?
HAB.1.2	Or cry out to you, “Violence!”
HAB.1.2	but you do not save?
HAB.1.3	Why do you make me look at injustice?
HAB.1.3	Why do you tolerate wrongdoing?
HAB.1.3	Destruction and violence are before me;
HAB.1.3	there is strife, and conflict abounds.
HAB.1.4	Therefore the law is paralyzed,
HAB.1.4	and justice never prevails.
HAB.1.4	The wicked hem in the righteous,
HAB.1.4	so that justice is perverted.
HAB.1.5	“Look at the nations and watch—
HAB.1.5	and be utterly amazed.
HAB.1.5	For I am going to do something in your days
HAB.1.5	that you would not believe,
HAB.1.5	even if you were told.
HAB.1.6	I am raising up the Babylonians,
HAB.1.6	that ruthless and impetuous people,
HAB.1.6	who sweep across the whole earth
HAB.1.6	to seize dwellings not their own.
HAB.1.7	They are a feared and dreaded people;
HAB.1.7	they are a law to themselves
HAB.1.7	and promote their own honor.
HAB.1.8	Their horses are swifter than leopards,
HAB.1.8	fiercer than wolves at dusk.
HAB.1.8	Their cavalry gallops headlong;
HAB.1.8	their horsemen come from afar.
HAB.1.8	They fly like an eagle swooping to devour;
HAB.1.9	they all come intent on violence.
HAB.1.9	Their hordes
HAB.1.9	and gather prisoners like sand.
HAB.1.10	They mock kings
HAB.1.10	and scoff at rulers.
HAB.1.10	They laugh at all fortified cities;
HAB.1.10	by building earthen ramps they capture them.
HAB.1.11	Then they sweep past like the wind and go on—
HAB.1.11	guilty people, whose own strength is their god.”
HAB.1.12	My God, my Holy One, you
HAB.1.12	You, 
HAB.1.12	you, my Rock, have ordained them to punish.
HAB.1.13	Your eyes are too pure to look on evil;
HAB.1.13	you cannot tolerate wrongdoing.
HAB.1.13	Why then do you tolerate the treacherous?
HAB.1.13	Why are you silent while the wicked
HAB.1.13	swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
HAB.1.14	You have made people like the fish in the sea,
HAB.1.14	like the sea creatures that have no ruler.
HAB.1.15	The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks,
HAB.1.15	he catches them in his net,
HAB.1.15	he gathers them up in his dragnet;
HAB.1.15	and so he rejoices and is glad.
HAB.1.16	Therefore he sacrifices to his net
HAB.1.16	and burns incense to his dragnet,
HAB.1.16	for by his net he lives in luxury
HAB.1.16	and enjoys the choicest food.
HAB.1.17	Is he to keep on emptying his net,
HAB.1.17	destroying nations without mercy?
HAB.2.1	I will stand at my watch
HAB.2.1	and station myself on the ramparts;
HAB.2.1	I will look to see what he will say to me,
HAB.2.1	and what answer I am to give to this complaint.
HAB.2.2	Then the 
HAB.2.2	“Write down the revelation
HAB.2.2	and make it plain on tablets
HAB.2.2	so that a herald
HAB.2.3	For the revelation awaits an appointed time;
HAB.2.3	it speaks of the end
HAB.2.3	and will not prove false.
HAB.2.3	Though it linger, wait for it;
HAB.2.3	it
HAB.2.3	and will not delay.
HAB.2.4	“See, the enemy is puffed up;
HAB.2.4	his desires are not upright—
HAB.2.4	but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness
HAB.2.5	indeed, wine betrays him;
HAB.2.5	he is arrogant and never at rest.
HAB.2.5	Because he is as greedy as the grave
HAB.2.5	and like death is never satisfied,
HAB.2.5	he gathers to himself all the nations
HAB.2.5	and takes captive all the peoples.
HAB.2.6	“Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying,
HAB.2.6	“ ‘Woe to him who piles up stolen goods
HAB.2.6	and makes himself wealthy by extortion!
HAB.2.6	How long must this go on?’
HAB.2.7	Will not your creditors suddenly arise?
HAB.2.7	Will they not wake up and make you tremble?
HAB.2.7	Then you will become their prey.
HAB.2.8	Because you have plundered many nations,
HAB.2.8	the peoples who are left will plunder you.
HAB.2.8	For you have shed human blood;
HAB.2.8	you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.
HAB.2.9	“Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain,
HAB.2.9	setting his nest on high
HAB.2.9	to escape the clutches of ruin!
HAB.2.10	You have plotted the ruin of many peoples,
HAB.2.10	shaming your own house and forfeiting your life.
HAB.2.11	The stones of the wall will cry out,
HAB.2.11	and the beams of the woodwork will echo it.
HAB.2.12	“Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed
HAB.2.12	and establishes a town by injustice!
HAB.2.13	Has not the 
HAB.2.13	that the people’s labor is only fuel for the fire,
HAB.2.13	that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing?
HAB.2.14	For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the 
HAB.2.14	as the waters cover the sea.
HAB.2.15	“Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors,
HAB.2.15	pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk,
HAB.2.15	so that he can gaze on their naked bodies!
HAB.2.16	You will be filled with shame instead of glory.
HAB.2.16	Now it is your turn! Drink and let your nakedness be exposed
HAB.2.16	The cup from the 
HAB.2.16	and disgrace will cover your glory.
HAB.2.17	The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,
HAB.2.17	and your destruction of animals will terrify you.
HAB.2.17	For you have shed human blood;
HAB.2.17	you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.
HAB.2.18	“Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman?
HAB.2.18	Or an image that teaches lies?
HAB.2.18	For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation;
HAB.2.18	he makes idols that cannot speak.
HAB.2.19	Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Come to life!’
HAB.2.19	Or to lifeless stone, ‘Wake up!’
HAB.2.19	Can it give guidance?
HAB.2.19	It is covered with gold and silver;
HAB.2.19	there is no breath in it.”
HAB.2.20	The 
HAB.2.20	let all the earth be silent before him.
HAB.3.1	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. On 
HAB.3.2	I stand in awe of your deeds, 
HAB.3.2	Repeat them in our day,
HAB.3.2	in our time make them known;
HAB.3.2	in wrath remember mercy.
HAB.3.3	God came from Teman,
HAB.3.3	the Holy One from Mount Paran.
HAB.3.3	His glory covered the heavens
HAB.3.3	and his praise filled the earth.
HAB.3.4	His splendor was like the sunrise;
HAB.3.4	rays flashed from his hand,
HAB.3.4	where his power was hidden.
HAB.3.5	Plague went before him;
HAB.3.5	pestilence followed his steps.
HAB.3.6	He stood, and shook the earth;
HAB.3.6	he looked, and made the nations tremble.
HAB.3.6	The ancient mountains crumbled
HAB.3.6	and the age-old hills collapsed—
HAB.3.6	but he marches on forever.
HAB.3.7	I saw the tents of Cushan in distress,
HAB.3.7	the dwellings of Midian in anguish.
HAB.3.8	Were you angry with the rivers, 
HAB.3.8	Was your wrath against the streams?
HAB.3.8	Did you rage against the sea
HAB.3.8	when you rode your horses
HAB.3.8	and your chariots to victory?
HAB.3.9	You uncovered your bow,
HAB.3.9	you called for many arrows.
HAB.3.9	You split the earth with rivers;
HAB.3.10	the mountains saw you and writhed.
HAB.3.10	Torrents of water swept by;
HAB.3.10	the deep roared
HAB.3.10	and lifted its waves on high.
HAB.3.11	Sun and moon stood still in the heavens
HAB.3.11	at the glint of your flying arrows,
HAB.3.11	at the lightning of your flashing spear.
HAB.3.12	In wrath you strode through the earth
HAB.3.12	and in anger you threshed the nations.
HAB.3.13	You came out to deliver your people,
HAB.3.13	to save your anointed one.
HAB.3.13	You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness,
HAB.3.13	you stripped him from head to foot.
HAB.3.14	With his own spear you pierced his head
HAB.3.14	when his warriors stormed out to scatter us,
HAB.3.14	gloating as though about to devour
HAB.3.14	the wretched who were in hiding.
HAB.3.15	You trampled the sea with your horses,
HAB.3.15	churning the great waters.
HAB.3.16	I heard and my heart pounded,
HAB.3.16	my lips quivered at the sound;
HAB.3.16	decay crept into my bones,
HAB.3.16	and my legs trembled.
HAB.3.16	Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity
HAB.3.16	to come on the nation invading us.
HAB.3.17	Though the fig tree does not bud
HAB.3.17	and there are no grapes on the vines,
HAB.3.17	though the olive crop fails
HAB.3.17	and the fields produce no food,
HAB.3.17	though there are no sheep in the pen
HAB.3.17	and no cattle in the stalls,

ZEP.1.5	those who bow down on the roofs
ZEP.1.5	to worship the starry host,

ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.14	near and coming quickly.
ZEP.1.14	The cry on the day of the 
ZEP.1.14	the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry.
ZEP.1.15	That day will be a day of wrath—
ZEP.1.15	a day of distress and anguish,
ZEP.1.15	a day of trouble and ruin,
ZEP.1.15	a day of darkness and gloom,
ZEP.1.15	a day of clouds and blackness—
ZEP.1.16	a day of trumpet and battle cry
ZEP.1.16	against the fortified cities
ZEP.1.16	and against the corner towers.
ZEP.1.17	“I will bring such distress on all people
ZEP.1.17	that they will grope about like those who are blind,
ZEP.1.17	because they have sinned against the 
ZEP.1.17	Their blood will be poured out like dust
ZEP.1.17	and their entrails like dung.
ZEP.1.18	Neither their silver nor their gold
ZEP.1.18	will be able to save them
ZEP.1.18	on the day of the 
ZEP.1.18	In the fire of his jealousy
ZEP.1.18	the whole earth will be consumed,
ZEP.1.18	for he will make a sudden end
ZEP.1.18	of all who live on the earth.
ZEP.2.1	Gather together, gather yourselves together,
ZEP.2.1	you shameful nation,
ZEP.2.2	before the decree takes effect
ZEP.2.2	and that day passes like windblown chaff,
ZEP.2.2	before the 
ZEP.2.2	comes upon you,
ZEP.2.2	before the day of the 
ZEP.2.2	comes upon you.
ZEP.2.3	Seek the 
ZEP.2.3	you who do what he commands.
ZEP.2.3	Seek righteousness, seek humility;
ZEP.2.3	perhaps you will be sheltered
ZEP.2.3	on the day of the 
ZEP.2.4	Gaza will be abandoned
ZEP.2.4	and Ashkelon left in ruins.
ZEP.2.4	At midday Ashdod will be emptied
ZEP.2.4	and Ekron uprooted.
ZEP.2.5	Woe to you who live by the sea,
ZEP.2.5	you Kerethite people;
ZEP.2.5	the word of the 
ZEP.2.5	Canaan, land of the Philistines.
ZEP.2.5	He says, “I will destroy you,
ZEP.2.5	and none will be left.”
ZEP.2.6	The land by the sea will become pastures
ZEP.2.6	having wells for shepherds
ZEP.2.6	and pens for flocks.
ZEP.2.7	That land will belong
ZEP.2.7	to the remnant of the people of Judah;
ZEP.2.7	there they will find pasture.
ZEP.2.7	In the evening they will lie down
ZEP.2.7	in the houses of Ashkelon.
ZEP.2.7	The 
ZEP.2.7	he will restore their fortunes.
ZEP.2.8	“I have heard the insults of Moab
ZEP.2.8	and the taunts of the Ammonites,
ZEP.2.8	who insulted my people
ZEP.2.8	and made threats against their land.
ZEP.2.9	Therefore, as surely as I live,”
ZEP.2.9	declares the 
ZEP.2.9	the God of Israel,
ZEP.2.9	“surely Moab will become like Sodom,
ZEP.2.9	the Ammonites like Gomorrah—
ZEP.2.9	a place of weeds and salt pits,
ZEP.2.9	a wasteland forever.
ZEP.2.9	The remnant of my people will plunder them;
ZEP.2.9	the survivors of my nation will inherit their land.”
ZEP.2.10	This is what they will get in return for their pride,
ZEP.2.10	for insulting and mocking
ZEP.2.10	the people of the 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.11	when he destroys all the gods of the earth.
ZEP.2.11	Distant nations will bow down to him,
ZEP.2.11	all of them in their own lands.
ZEP.2.12	“You Cushites,
ZEP.2.12	will be slain by my sword.”
ZEP.2.13	He will stretch out his hand against the north
ZEP.2.13	and destroy Assyria,
ZEP.2.13	leaving Nineveh utterly desolate
ZEP.2.13	and dry as the desert.
ZEP.2.14	Flocks and herds will lie down there,
ZEP.2.14	creatures of every kind.
ZEP.2.14	The desert owl and the screech owl
ZEP.2.14	will roost on her columns.
ZEP.2.14	Their hooting will echo through the windows,
ZEP.2.14	rubble will fill the doorways,
ZEP.2.14	the beams of cedar will be exposed.
ZEP.2.15	This is the city of revelry
ZEP.2.15	that lived in safety.
ZEP.2.15	She said to herself,
ZEP.2.15	“I am the one! And there is none besides me.”
ZEP.2.15	What a ruin she has become,
ZEP.2.15	a lair for wild beasts!
ZEP.2.15	All who pass by her scoff
ZEP.2.15	and shake their fists.
ZEP.3.1	Woe to the city of oppressors,
ZEP.3.1	rebellious and defiled!
ZEP.3.2	She obeys no one,
ZEP.3.2	she accepts no correction.
ZEP.3.2	She does not trust in the 
ZEP.3.2	she does not draw near to her God.
ZEP.3.3	Her officials within her
ZEP.3.3	are roaring lions;
ZEP.3.3	her rulers are evening wolves,
ZEP.3.3	who leave nothing for the morning.
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets are unprincipled;
ZEP.3.4	they are treacherous people.
ZEP.3.4	Her priests profane the sanctuary
ZEP.3.4	and do violence to the law.
ZEP.3.5	The 
ZEP.3.5	he does no wrong.
ZEP.3.5	Morning by morning he dispenses his justice,
ZEP.3.5	and every new day he does not fail,
ZEP.3.5	yet the unrighteous know no shame.
ZEP.3.6	“I have destroyed nations;
ZEP.3.6	their strongholds are demolished.
ZEP.3.6	I have left their streets deserted,
ZEP.3.6	with no one passing through.
ZEP.3.6	Their cities are laid waste;
ZEP.3.6	they are deserted and empty.
ZEP.3.7	Of Jerusalem I thought,
ZEP.3.7	‘Surely you will fear me
ZEP.3.7	and accept correction!’
ZEP.3.7	Then her place of refuge
ZEP.3.7	nor all my punishments come upon
ZEP.3.7	But they were still eager
ZEP.3.7	to act corruptly in all they did.
ZEP.3.8	Therefore wait for me,”
ZEP.3.8	declares the 
ZEP.3.8	“for the day I will stand up to testify.
ZEP.3.8	I have decided to assemble the nations,
ZEP.3.8	to gather the kingdoms
ZEP.3.8	and to pour out my wrath on them—
ZEP.3.8	all my fierce anger.
ZEP.3.8	The whole world will be consumed
ZEP.3.8	by the fire of my jealous anger.
ZEP.3.9	“Then I will purify the lips of the peoples,
ZEP.3.9	that all of them may call on the name of the 
ZEP.3.9	and serve him shoulder to shoulder.
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Cush
ZEP.3.10	my worshipers, my scattered people,
ZEP.3.10	will bring me offerings.
ZEP.3.11	On that day you, Jerusalem, will not be put to shame
ZEP.3.11	for all the wrongs you have done to me,
ZEP.3.11	because I will remove from you
ZEP.3.11	your arrogant boasters.
ZEP.3.11	Never again will you be haughty
ZEP.3.11	on my holy hill.
ZEP.3.12	But I will leave within you
ZEP.3.12	the meek and humble.
ZEP.3.12	The remnant of Israel
ZEP.3.12	will trust in the name of the 
ZEP.3.13	They will do no wrong;
ZEP.3.13	they will tell no lies.
ZEP.3.13	A deceitful tongue
ZEP.3.13	will not be found in their mouths.
ZEP.3.13	They will eat and lie down
ZEP.3.13	and no one will make them afraid.”
ZEP.3.14	Sing, Daughter Zion;
ZEP.3.14	shout aloud, Israel!
ZEP.3.14	Be glad and rejoice with all your heart,
ZEP.3.14	Daughter Jerusalem!
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.15	he has turned back your enemy.
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.15	never again will you fear any harm.
ZEP.3.16	On that day
ZEP.3.16	they will say to Jerusalem,
ZEP.3.16	“Do not fear, Zion;
ZEP.3.16	do not let your hands hang limp.
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.17	the Mighty Warrior who saves.
ZEP.3.17	He will take great delight in you;
ZEP.3.17	in his love he will no longer rebuke you,
ZEP.3.17	but will rejoice over you with singing.”
ZEP.3.18	“I will remove from you
ZEP.3.18	all who mourn over the loss of your appointed festivals,
ZEP.3.18	which is a burden and reproach for you.
ZEP.3.19	At that time I will deal
ZEP.3.19	with all who oppressed you.
ZEP.3.19	I will rescue the lame;
ZEP.3.19	I will gather the exiles.
ZEP.3.19	I will give them praise and honor
ZEP.3.19	in every land where they have suffered shame.
ZEP.3.20	At that time I will gather you;
ZEP.3.20	at that time I will bring you home.
ZEP.3.20	I will give you honor and praise
ZEP.3.20	among all the peoples of the earth
ZEP.3.20	when I restore your fortunes
ZEP.3.20	before your very eyes,”
ZEP.3.20	says the 
HAG.1.1	In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the 
HAG.1.2	This is what the 
HAG.1.3	Then the word of the 
HAG.1.4	“Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?”
HAG.1.5	Now this is what the 
HAG.1.6	You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.”
HAG.1.7	This is what the 
HAG.1.8	Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,” says the 
HAG.1.9	“You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?” declares the 
HAG.1.10	Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops. 
HAG.1.11	I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.”
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the 
HAG.1.13	Then Haggai, the 
HAG.1.14	So the 
HAG.1.15	on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.
HAG.1.15	In the second year of King Darius,
HAG.2.1	on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the 
HAG.2.2	“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jozadak,
HAG.2.3	‘Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing? 
HAG.2.4	But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares the 
HAG.2.5	‘This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.’
HAG.2.6	“This is what the 
HAG.2.7	I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the 
HAG.2.8	‘The silver is mine and the gold is mine,’ declares the 
HAG.2.9	‘The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,’ says the 
HAG.2.10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the 
HAG.2.11	“This is what the 
HAG.2.12	If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, olive oil or other food, does it become consecrated?’ ”
HAG.2.12	The priests answered, “No.”
HAG.2.13	Then Haggai said, “If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?”
HAG.2.13	“Yes,” the priests replied, “it becomes defiled.”
HAG.2.14	Then Haggai said, “ ‘So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,’ declares the 
HAG.2.15	“ ‘Now give careful thought to this from this day on
HAG.2.16	When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty. 
HAG.2.17	I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not return to me,’ declares the 
HAG.2.18	‘From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the 
HAG.2.19	Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit.
HAG.2.19	“ ‘From this day on I will bless you.’ ”
HAG.2.20	The word of the 
HAG.2.21	“Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. 
HAG.2.22	I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.
HAG.2.23	“ ‘On that day,’ declares the 
ZEC.1.1	In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the 
ZEC.1.2	“The 
ZEC.1.3	Therefore tell the people: This is what the 
ZEC.1.4	Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the 
ZEC.1.5	Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever? 
ZEC.1.6	But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors?
ZEC.1.6	“Then they repented and said, ‘The 
ZEC.1.7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the 
ZEC.1.8	During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses.
ZEC.1.9	I asked, “What are these, my lord?”
ZEC.1.9	The angel who was talking with me answered, “I will show you what they are.”
ZEC.1.10	Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the 
ZEC.1.11	And they reported to the angel of the 
ZEC.1.12	Then the angel of the 
ZEC.1.13	So the 
ZEC.1.14	Then the angel who was speaking to me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the 
ZEC.1.15	and I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they went too far with the punishment.’
ZEC.1.16	“Therefore this is what the 
ZEC.1.17	“Proclaim further: This is what the 
ZEC.1.18	Then I looked up, and there before me were four horns. 
ZEC.1.19	I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these?”
ZEC.1.19	He answered me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”
ZEC.1.20	Then the 
ZEC.1.21	I asked, “What are these coming to do?”
ZEC.1.21	He answered, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise their head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people.”
ZEC.2.1	Then I looked up, and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
ZEC.2.2	I asked, “Where are you going?”
ZEC.2.2	He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is.”
ZEC.2.3	While the angel who was speaking to me was leaving, another angel came to meet him 
ZEC.2.4	and said to him: “Run, tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of people and animals in it. 
ZEC.2.5	And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,’ declares the 
ZEC.2.6	“Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the 
ZEC.2.7	“Come, Zion! Escape, you who live in Daughter Babylon!” 
ZEC.2.8	For this is what the 
ZEC.2.9	I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them.
ZEC.2.10	“Shout and be glad, Daughter Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you,” declares the 
ZEC.2.11	“Many nations will be joined with the

ZEC.3.2	The 
ZEC.3.3	Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 
ZEC.3.4	The angel said to those who were standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes.”
ZEC.3.4	Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you.”
ZEC.3.5	Then I said, “Put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the 
ZEC.3.6	The angel of the 
ZEC.3.7	“This is what the 
ZEC.3.8	“ ‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. 
ZEC.3.9	See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes
ZEC.3.10	“ ‘In that day each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree,’ declares the 
ZEC.4.1	Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep. 
ZEC.4.2	He asked me, “What do you see?”
ZEC.4.2	I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps. 
ZEC.4.3	Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”
ZEC.4.4	I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
ZEC.4.5	He answered, “Do you not know what these are?”
ZEC.4.5	“No, my lord,” I replied.
ZEC.4.6	So he said to me, “This is the word of the 
ZEC.4.7	“What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’ ”
ZEC.4.8	Then the word of the 
ZEC.4.9	“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the

ZEC.4.12	Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?”
ZEC.4.13	He replied, “Do you not know what these are?”
ZEC.4.13	“No, my lord,” I said.
ZEC.4.14	So he said, “These are the two who are anointed to

ZEC.5.2	He asked me, “What do you see?”
ZEC.5.2	I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.
ZEC.5.3	And he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone who swears falsely will be banished. 
ZEC.5.4	The 
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what is appearing.”
ZEC.5.6	I asked, “What is it?”
ZEC.5.6	He replied, “It is a basket.” And he added, “This is the iniquity
ZEC.5.7	Then the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman! 
ZEC.5.8	He said, “This is wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed its lead cover down on it.
ZEC.5.9	Then I looked up—and there before me were two women, with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth.
ZEC.5.10	“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was speaking to me.
ZEC.5.11	He replied, “To the country of Babylonia
ZEC.6.1	I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze. 
ZEC.6.2	The first chariot had red horses, the second black, 
ZEC.6.3	the third white, and the fourth dappled—all of them powerful. 
ZEC.6.4	I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these, my lord?”
ZEC.6.5	The angel answered me, “These are the four spirits

ZEC.6.7	When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, “Go throughout the earth!” So they went throughout the earth.
ZEC.6.8	Then he called to me, “Look, those going toward the north country have given my Spirit
ZEC.6.9	The word of the 
ZEC.6.10	“Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. 
ZEC.6.11	Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jozadak.

ZEC.7.5	“Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted? 
ZEC.7.6	And when you were eating and drinking, were you not just feasting for yourselves? 
ZEC.7.7	Are these not the words the 
ZEC.7.8	And the word of the 
ZEC.7.9	“This is what the 
ZEC.7.10	Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.’
ZEC.7.11	“But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and covered their ears. 
ZEC.7.12	They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the 
ZEC.7.13	“ ‘When I called, they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen,’ says the 
ZEC.7.14	‘I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land they left behind them was so desolate that no one traveled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.’ ”

ZEC.8.2	This is what the 
ZEC.8.3	This is what the

ZEC.8.5	The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”
ZEC.8.6	This is what the 
ZEC.8.7	This is what the 
ZEC.8.8	I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God.”
ZEC.8.9	This is what the 
ZEC.8.10	Before that time there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, since I had turned everyone against their neighbor. 
ZEC.8.11	But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past,” declares the 
ZEC.8.12	“The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people. 
ZEC.8.13	Just as you, Judah and Israel, have been a curse

ZEC.8.15	“so now I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid. 
ZEC.8.16	These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts;

ZEC.9.5	and Ashkelon will be deserted.
ZEC.9.6	A mongrel people will occupy Ashdod,
ZEC.9.6	and I will put an end to the pride of the Philistines.
ZEC.9.7	I will take the blood from their mouths,
ZEC.9.7	the forbidden food from between their teeth.
ZEC.9.7	Those who are left will belong to our God
ZEC.9.7	and become a clan in Judah,
ZEC.9.7	and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
ZEC.9.8	But I will encamp at my temple
ZEC.9.8	to guard it against marauding forces.
ZEC.9.8	Never again will an oppressor overrun my people,
ZEC.9.8	for now I am keeping watch.
ZEC.9.9	Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!
ZEC.9.9	Shout, Daughter Jerusalem!
ZEC.9.9	See, your king comes to you,
ZEC.9.9	righteous and victorious,
ZEC.9.9	lowly and riding on a donkey,
ZEC.9.9	on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
ZEC.9.10	I will take away the chariots from Ephraim
ZEC.9.10	and the warhorses from Jerusalem,
ZEC.9.10	and the battle bow will be broken.
ZEC.9.10	He will proclaim peace to the nations.
ZEC.9.10	His rule will extend from sea to sea
ZEC.9.10	and from the River
ZEC.9.11	As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you,
ZEC.9.11	I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit.
ZEC.9.12	Return to your fortress, you prisoners of hope;
ZEC.9.12	even now I announce that I will restore twice as much to you.
ZEC.9.13	I will bend Judah as I bend my bow
ZEC.9.13	and fill it with Ephraim.
ZEC.9.13	I will rouse your sons, Zion,
ZEC.9.13	against your sons, Greece,
ZEC.9.13	and make you like a warrior’s sword.
ZEC.9.14	Then the 
ZEC.9.14	his arrow will flash like lightning.
ZEC.9.14	The Sovereign 
ZEC.9.14	he will march in the storms of the south,
ZEC.9.15	and the 
ZEC.9.15	They will destroy
ZEC.9.15	and overcome with slingstones.
ZEC.9.15	They will drink and roar as with wine;
ZEC.9.15	they will be full like a bowl
ZEC.9.15	used for sprinkling
ZEC.9.16	The 
ZEC.9.16	as a shepherd saves his flock.
ZEC.9.16	They will sparkle in his land
ZEC.9.16	like jewels in a crown.
ZEC.9.17	How attractive and beautiful they will be!
ZEC.9.17	Grain will make the young men thrive,
ZEC.9.17	and new wine the young women.
ZEC.10.1	Ask the 
ZEC.10.1	it is the 
ZEC.10.1	He gives showers of rain to all people,
ZEC.10.1	and plants of the field to everyone.
ZEC.10.2	The idols speak deceitfully,
ZEC.10.2	diviners see visions that lie;
ZEC.10.2	they tell dreams that are false,
ZEC.10.2	they give comfort in vain.
ZEC.10.2	Therefore the people wander like sheep
ZEC.10.2	oppressed for lack of a shepherd.
ZEC.10.3	“My anger burns against the shepherds,
ZEC.10.3	and I will punish the leaders;
ZEC.10.3	for the 
ZEC.10.3	for his flock, the people of Judah,
ZEC.10.3	and make them like a proud horse in battle.
ZEC.10.4	From Judah will come the cornerstone,
ZEC.10.4	from him the tent peg,
ZEC.10.4	from him the battle bow,
ZEC.10.4	from him every ruler.
ZEC.10.5	Together they
ZEC.10.5	trampling their enemy into the mud of the streets.
ZEC.10.5	They will fight because the 
ZEC.10.5	and they will put the enemy horsemen to shame.
ZEC.10.6	“I will strengthen Judah
ZEC.10.6	and save the tribes of Joseph.
ZEC.10.6	I will restore them
ZEC.10.6	because I have compassion on them.
ZEC.10.6	They will be as though
ZEC.10.6	I had not rejected them,
ZEC.10.6	for I am the 
ZEC.10.6	and I will answer them.
ZEC.10.7	The Ephraimites will become like warriors,
ZEC.10.7	and their hearts will be glad as with wine.
ZEC.10.7	Their children will see it and be joyful;
ZEC.10.7	their hearts will rejoice in the 
ZEC.10.8	I will signal for them
ZEC.10.8	and gather them in.
ZEC.10.8	Surely I will redeem them;
ZEC.10.8	they will be as numerous as before.
ZEC.10.9	Though I scatter them among the peoples,
ZEC.10.9	yet in distant lands they will remember me.
ZEC.10.9	They and their children will survive,
ZEC.10.9	and they will return.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them back from Egypt
ZEC.10.10	and gather them from Assyria.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon,
ZEC.10.10	and there will not be room enough for them.
ZEC.10.11	They will pass through the sea of trouble;
ZEC.10.11	the surging sea will be subdued
ZEC.10.11	and all the depths of the Nile will dry up.
ZEC.10.11	Assyria’s pride will be brought down
ZEC.10.11	and Egypt’s scepter will pass away.
ZEC.10.12	I will strengthen them in the 
ZEC.10.12	and in his name they will live securely,”
ZEC.10.12	declares the 
ZEC.11.1	Open your doors, Lebanon,
ZEC.11.1	so that fire may devour your cedars!
ZEC.11.2	Wail, you juniper, for the cedar has fallen;
ZEC.11.2	the stately trees are ruined!
ZEC.11.2	Wail, oaks of Bashan;
ZEC.11.2	the dense forest has been cut down!
ZEC.11.3	Listen to the wail of the shepherds;
ZEC.11.3	their rich pastures are destroyed!
ZEC.11.3	Listen to the roar of the lions;
ZEC.11.3	the lush thicket of the Jordan is ruined!
ZEC.11.4	This is what the 
ZEC.11.5	Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Praise the 
ZEC.11.6	For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,” declares the 
ZEC.11.7	So I shepherded the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock. 
ZEC.11.8	In one month I got rid of the three shepherds.
ZEC.11.8	The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them 
ZEC.11.9	and said, “I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.”
ZEC.11.10	Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations. 
ZEC.11.11	It was revoked on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the 
ZEC.11.12	I told them, “If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.
ZEC.11.13	And the 
ZEC.11.14	Then I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the family bond between Judah and Israel.
ZEC.11.15	Then the 
ZEC.11.16	For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hooves.
ZEC.11.17	“Woe to the worthless shepherd,
ZEC.11.17	who deserts the flock!
ZEC.11.17	May the sword strike his arm and his right eye!
ZEC.11.17	May his arm be completely withered,
ZEC.11.17	his right eye totally blinded!”
ZEC.12.1	A prophecy: The word of the 
ZEC.12.1	The 
ZEC.12.2	“I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem. 
ZEC.12.3	On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves. 
ZEC.12.4	On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the 
ZEC.12.5	Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the 
ZEC.12.6	“On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place.
ZEC.12.7	“The 
ZEC.12.8	On that day the 
ZEC.12.9	On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.10	“And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit
ZEC.12.11	On that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be as great as the weeping of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 
ZEC.12.12	The land will mourn, each clan by itself, with their wives by themselves: the clan of the house of David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives, 
ZEC.12.13	the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives, 
ZEC.12.14	and all the rest of the clans and their wives.
ZEC.13.1	“On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
ZEC.13.2	“On that day, I will banish the names of the idols from the land, and they will be remembered no more,” declares the 
ZEC.13.3	And if anyone still prophesies, their father and mother, to whom they were born, will say to them, ‘You must die, because you have told lies in the 
ZEC.13.4	“On that day every prophet will be ashamed of their prophetic vision. They will not put on a prophet’s garment of hair in order to deceive. 
ZEC.13.5	Each will say, ‘I am not a prophet. I am a farmer; the land has been my livelihood since my youth.
ZEC.13.6	If someone asks, ‘What are these wounds on your body
ZEC.13.7	“Awake, sword, against my shepherd,
ZEC.13.7	against the man who is close to me!”
ZEC.13.7	declares the 
ZEC.13.7	“Strike the shepherd,
ZEC.13.7	and the sheep will be scattered,
ZEC.13.7	and I will turn my hand against the little ones.
ZEC.13.8	In the whole land,” declares the 
ZEC.13.8	“two-thirds will be struck down and perish;
ZEC.13.8	yet one-third will be left in it.
ZEC.13.9	This third I will put into the fire;
ZEC.13.9	I will refine them like silver
ZEC.13.9	and test them like gold.
ZEC.13.9	They will call on my name
ZEC.13.9	and I will answer them;
ZEC.13.9	I will say, ‘They are my people,’
ZEC.13.9	and they will say, ‘The 
ZEC.14.1	A day of the 
ZEC.14.2	I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city. 
ZEC.14.3	Then the 
ZEC.14.4	On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south. 
ZEC.14.5	You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake
ZEC.14.6	On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness. 
ZEC.14.7	It will be a unique day—a day known only to the 
ZEC.14.8	On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it east to the Dead Sea and half of it west to the Mediterranean Sea, in summer and in winter.
ZEC.14.9	The 
ZEC.14.10	The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up high from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses, and will remain in its place. 
ZEC.14.11	It will be inhabited; never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure.
ZEC.14.12	This is the plague with which the 
ZEC.14.13	On that day people will be stricken by the 
ZEC.14.14	Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—great quantities of gold and silver and clothing. 
ZEC.14.15	A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.
ZEC.14.16	Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.17	If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.18	If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The 
ZEC.14.19	This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.
ZEC.14.20	On that day 
ZEC.14.21	Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the 
MAL.1.1	A prophecy: The word of the 
MAL.1.2	“I have loved you,” says the 
MAL.1.2	“But you ask, ‘How have you loved us?’
MAL.1.2	“Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the 
MAL.1.3	but Esau I have hated, and I have turned his hill country into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.”
MAL.1.4	Edom may say, “Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins.”
MAL.1.4	But this is what the 
MAL.1.5	You will see it with your own eyes and say, ‘Great is the 
MAL.1.6	“A son honors his father, and a slave his master. If I am a father, where is the honor due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?” says the 
MAL.1.6	“It is you priests who show contempt for my name.
MAL.1.6	“But you ask, ‘How have we shown contempt for your name?’
MAL.1.7	“By offering defiled food on my altar.
MAL.1.7	“But you ask, ‘How have we defiled you?’
MAL.1.7	“By saying that the 
MAL.1.8	When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? When you sacrifice lame or diseased animals, is that not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?” says the 
MAL.1.9	“Now plead with God to be gracious to us. With such offerings from your hands, will he accept you?”—says the 
MAL.1.10	“Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not light useless fires on my altar! I am not pleased with you,” says the 
MAL.1.11	My name will be great among the nations, from where the sun rises to where it sets. In every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to me, because my name will be great among the nations,” says the 
MAL.1.12	“But you profane it by saying, ‘The Lord’s table is defiled,’ and, ‘Its food is contemptible.’ 
MAL.1.13	And you say, ‘What a burden!’ and you sniff at it contemptuously,” says the 
MAL.1.13	“When you bring injured, lame or diseased animals and offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from your hands?” says the 
MAL.1.14	“Cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord. For I am a great king,” says the 
MAL.2.1	“And now, you priests, this warning is for you. 
MAL.2.2	If you do not listen, and if you do not resolve to honor my name,” says the 
MAL.2.3	“Because of you I will rebuke your descendants
MAL.2.4	And you will know that I have sent you this warning so that my covenant with Levi may continue,” says the 
MAL.2.5	“My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him; this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name. 
MAL.2.6	True instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from sin.
MAL.2.7	“For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, because he is the messenger of the 
MAL.2.8	But you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi,” says the 
MAL.2.9	“So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”
MAL.2.10	Do we not all have one Father
MAL.2.11	Judah has been unfaithful. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the 
MAL.2.12	As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the 
MAL.2.13	Another thing you do: You flood the 
MAL.2.14	You ask, “Why?” It is because the 
MAL.2.15	Has not the one God made you? You belong to him in body and spirit. And what does the one God seek? Godly offspring.
MAL.2.16	“The man who hates and divorces his wife,” says the 
MAL.2.16	So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful.
MAL.2.17	You have wearied the 
MAL.2.17	“How have we wearied him?” you ask.
MAL.2.17	By saying, “All who do evil are good in the eyes of the 
MAL.3.1	“I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,” says the 
MAL.3.2	But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner’s fire or a launderer’s soap. 
MAL.3.3	He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the 
MAL.3.4	and the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the 
MAL.3.5	“So I will come to put you on trial. I will be quick to testify against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, against those who defraud laborers of their wages, who oppress the widows and the fatherless, and deprive the foreigners among you of justice, but do not fear me,” says the 
MAL.3.6	“I the 
MAL.3.7	Ever since the time of your ancestors you have turned away from my decrees and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says the 
MAL.3.7	“But you ask, ‘How are we to return?’
MAL.3.8	“Will a mere mortal rob God? Yet you rob me.
MAL.3.8	“But you ask, ‘How are we robbing you?’
MAL.3.8	“In tithes and offerings. 
MAL.3.9	You are under a curse—your whole nation—because you are robbing me. 
MAL.3.10	Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the 
MAL.3.11	I will prevent pests from devouring your crops, and the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit before it is ripe,” says the 
MAL.3.12	“Then all the nations will call you blessed, for yours will be a delightful land,” says the 
MAL.3.13	“You have spoken arrogantly against me,” says the 
MAL.3.13	“Yet you ask, ‘What have we said against you?’
MAL.3.14	“You have said, ‘It is futile to serve God. What do we gain by carrying out his requirements and going about like mourners before the 
MAL.3.15	But now we call the arrogant blessed. Certainly evildoers prosper, and even when they put God to the test, they get away with it.’ ”
MAL.3.16	Then those who feared the 
MAL.3.17	“On the day when I act,” says the 
MAL.3.18	And you will again see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.
MAL.4.1	“Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble, and the day that is coming will set them on fire,” says the 
MAL.4.2	But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its rays. And you will go out and frolic like well-fed calves. 
MAL.4.3	Then you will trample on the wicked; they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act,” says the 
MAL.4.4	“Remember the law of my servant Moses, the decrees and laws I gave him at Horeb for all Israel.
MAL.4.5	“See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the 
MAL.4.6	He will turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the hearts of the children to their parents; or else I will come and strike the land with total destruction.”

MAT.1.9	Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
MAT.1.10	Hezekiah the father of Manasseh,
MAT.1.10	Manasseh the father of Amon,
MAT.1.10	Amon the father of Josiah,
MAT.1.11	and Josiah the father of Jeconiah
MAT.1.12	After the exile to Babylon:
MAT.1.12	Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel,
MAT.1.12	Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,
MAT.1.13	Zerubbabel the father of Abihud,
MAT.1.13	Abihud the father of Eliakim,

MAT.1.15	Elihud the father of Eleazar,
MAT.1.15	Eleazar the father of Matthan,
MAT.1.15	Matthan the father of Jacob,
MAT.1.16	and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus who is called the Messiah.
MAT.1.17	Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.
MAT.1.18	This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about
MAT.1.19	Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet
MAT.1.20	But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 
MAT.1.21	She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,
MAT.1.22	All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: 
MAT.1.23	“The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel”
MAT.1.24	When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. 
MAT.1.25	But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.
MAT.2.1	After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi
MAT.2.2	and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”
MAT.2.3	When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. 
MAT.2.4	When he had called together all the people’s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born. 
MAT.2.5	“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:
MAT.2.6	“ ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
MAT.2.6	are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;
MAT.2.6	for out of you will come a ruler
MAT.2.6	who will shepherd my people Israel.’
MAT.2.7	Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. 
MAT.2.8	He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”
MAT.2.9	After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. 
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. 
MAT.2.11	On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. 
MAT.2.12	And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.
MAT.2.13	When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up,” he said, “take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”
MAT.2.14	So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, 
MAT.2.15	where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
MAT.2.16	When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. 
MAT.2.17	Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
MAT.2.18	“A voice is heard in Ramah,
MAT.2.18	weeping and great mourning,
MAT.2.18	Rachel weeping for her children
MAT.2.18	and refusing to be comforted,
MAT.2.18	because they are no more.”
MAT.2.19	After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt 
MAT.2.20	and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child’s life are dead.”
MAT.2.21	So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. 
MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, 
MAT.2.23	and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.
MAT.3.1	In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea 
MAT.3.2	and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” 
MAT.3.3	This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah:
MAT.3.3	“A voice of one calling in the wilderness,
MAT.3.3	‘Prepare the way for the Lord,
MAT.3.3	make straight paths for him.’ ”
MAT.3.4	John’s clothes were made of camel’s hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 
MAT.3.5	People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan. 
MAT.3.6	Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
MAT.3.7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
MAT.3.8	Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. 
MAT.3.9	And do not think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 
MAT.3.10	The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
MAT.3.11	“I baptize you with
MAT.3.12	His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
MAT.3.13	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. 
MAT.3.14	But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”
MAT.3.15	Jesus replied, 
MAT.3.16	As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. 
MAT.3.17	And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”
MAT.4.1	Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
MAT.4.2	After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. 
MAT.4.3	The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”
MAT.4.4	Jesus answered, 
MAT.4.5	Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. 
MAT.4.6	“If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written:
MAT.4.6	“ ‘He will command his angels concerning you,
MAT.4.6	and they will lift you up in their hands,
MAT.4.6	so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’
MAT.4.7	Jesus answered him, 
MAT.4.8	Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. 
MAT.4.9	“All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.”
MAT.4.10	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.4.11	Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.
MAT.4.12	When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. 
MAT.4.13	Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali— 
MAT.4.14	to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:
MAT.4.15	“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,
MAT.4.15	the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan,
MAT.4.15	Galilee of the Gentiles—
MAT.4.16	the people living in darkness
MAT.4.16	have seen a great light;
MAT.4.16	on those living in the land of the shadow of death
MAT.4.16	a light has dawned.”
MAT.4.17	From that time on Jesus began to preach, 
MAT.4.18	As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 
MAT.4.19	 Jesus said, 
MAT.4.20	At once they left their nets and followed him.
MAT.4.21	Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, 
MAT.4.22	and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
MAT.4.23	Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. 
MAT.4.24	News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them. 
MAT.4.25	Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis,
MAT.5.1	Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, 
MAT.5.2	and he began to teach them.
MAT.5.2	He said:
MAT.7.28	When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, 
MAT.7.29	because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.
MAT.8.1	When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. 
MAT.8.2	A man with leprosy
MAT.8.3	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. 
MAT.8.4	Then Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.5	When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. 
MAT.8.6	“Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.”
MAT.8.7	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.8	The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 
MAT.8.9	For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
MAT.8.10	When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, 
MAT.8.13	Then Jesus said to the centurion, 
MAT.8.14	When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. 
MAT.8.15	He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.
MAT.8.16	When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. 
MAT.8.17	This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
MAT.8.17	“He took up our infirmities
MAT.8.17	and bore our diseases.”
MAT.8.18	When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. 
MAT.8.19	Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
MAT.8.20	Jesus replied, 
MAT.8.21	Another disciple said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
MAT.8.22	But Jesus told him, 
MAT.8.23	Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. 
MAT.8.24	Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. 
MAT.8.25	The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to drown!”
MAT.8.26	He replied, 
MAT.8.27	The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!”
MAT.8.28	When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes,
MAT.8.29	“What do you want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?”
MAT.8.30	Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. 
MAT.8.31	The demons begged Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”
MAT.8.32	He said to them, 
MAT.8.33	Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. 
MAT.8.34	Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.
MAT.9.1	Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town. 
MAT.9.2	Some men brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, 
MAT.9.3	At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!”
MAT.9.4	Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, 
MAT.9.6	 So he said to the paralyzed man, 
MAT.9.7	Then the man got up and went home. 
MAT.9.8	When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to man.
MAT.9.9	As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. 
MAT.9.10	While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. 
MAT.9.11	When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
MAT.9.12	On hearing this, Jesus said, 
MAT.9.14	Then John’s disciples came and asked him, “How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”
MAT.9.15	Jesus answered, 
MAT.9.18	While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, “My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.” 
MAT.9.19	Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.
MAT.9.20	Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. 
MAT.9.21	She said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.”
MAT.9.22	Jesus turned and saw her. 
MAT.9.23	When Jesus entered the synagogue leader’s house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes, 
MAT.9.24	he said, 
MAT.9.25	After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. 
MAT.9.26	News of this spread through all that region.
MAT.9.27	As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
MAT.9.28	When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, 
MAT.9.28	“Yes, Lord,” they replied.
MAT.9.29	Then he touched their eyes and said, 
MAT.9.30	and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, 
MAT.9.31	But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.
MAT.9.32	While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. 
MAT.9.33	And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.”
MAT.9.35	Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. 
MAT.9.36	When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 
MAT.9.37	Then he said to his disciples, 
MAT.10.1	Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
MAT.10.2	These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; 
MAT.10.3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 
MAT.10.4	Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
MAT.10.5	These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: 
MAT.11.1	After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
MAT.11.2	When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples 
MAT.11.3	to ask him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”
MAT.11.4	Jesus replied, 
MAT.11.7	As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: 
MAT.11.20	Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. 
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus said, 
MAT.12.1	At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. 
MAT.12.2	When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
MAT.12.3	He answered, 
MAT.12.9	Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, 
MAT.12.10	and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”
MAT.12.11	He said to them, 
MAT.12.13	Then he said to the man, 
MAT.12.14	But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
MAT.12.15	Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. 
MAT.12.16	He warned them not to tell others about him. 
MAT.12.17	This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
MAT.12.18	“Here is my servant whom I have chosen,
MAT.12.18	the one I love, in whom I delight;
MAT.12.18	I will put my Spirit on him,
MAT.12.18	and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
MAT.12.19	He will not quarrel or cry out;
MAT.12.19	no one will hear his voice in the streets.
MAT.12.20	A bruised reed he will not break,
MAT.12.20	and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out,
MAT.12.20	till he has brought justice through to victory.
MAT.12.21	In his name the nations will put their hope.”
MAT.12.22	Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. 
MAT.12.23	All the people were astonished and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”
MAT.12.24	But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.”
MAT.12.25	Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, 
MAT.12.38	Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”
MAT.12.39	He answered, 
MAT.12.46	While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. 
MAT.12.47	Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.”
MAT.12.48	He replied to him, 
MAT.12.49	Pointing to his disciples, he said, 
MAT.13.1	That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. 
MAT.13.2	Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. 
MAT.13.3	Then he told them many things in parables, saying: 
MAT.13.10	The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”
MAT.13.11	He replied, 
MAT.13.24	Jesus told them another parable: 
MAT.13.31	He told them another parable: 
MAT.13.33	He told them still another parable: 
MAT.13.34	Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. 
MAT.13.35	So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet:
MAT.13.35	“I will open my mouth in parables,
MAT.13.35	I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”
MAT.13.36	Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
MAT.13.37	He answered, 
MAT.13.51	“Yes,” they replied.
MAT.13.52	He said to them, 
MAT.13.53	When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. 
MAT.13.54	Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” they asked. 
MAT.13.55	“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? 
MAT.13.56	Aren’t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” 
MAT.13.57	And they took offense at him.
MAT.13.57	But Jesus said to them, 
MAT.13.58	And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
MAT.14.1	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus, 
MAT.14.2	and he said to his attendants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
MAT.14.3	Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, 
MAT.14.4	for John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to have her.” 
MAT.14.5	Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
MAT.14.6	On Herod’s birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much 
MAT.14.7	that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. 
MAT.14.8	Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.” 
MAT.14.9	The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted 
MAT.14.10	and had John beheaded in the prison. 
MAT.14.11	His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother. 
MAT.14.12	John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
MAT.14.13	When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns. 
MAT.14.14	When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
MAT.14.15	As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and it’s already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”
MAT.14.16	Jesus replied, 
MAT.14.17	“We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.
MAT.14.19	And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. 
MAT.14.20	They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 
MAT.14.21	The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.
MAT.14.22	Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. 
MAT.14.23	After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, 
MAT.14.24	and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.
MAT.14.25	Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. 
MAT.14.26	When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear.
MAT.14.27	But Jesus immediately said to them: 
MAT.14.28	“Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.”
MAT.14.29	Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”
MAT.14.31	Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. 
MAT.14.32	And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. 
MAT.14.33	Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”
MAT.14.34	When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. 
MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him 
MAT.14.36	and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
MAT.15.1	Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, 
MAT.15.2	“Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don’t wash their hands before they eat!”
MAT.15.3	Jesus replied, 
MAT.15.10	Jesus called the crowd to him and said, 
MAT.15.12	Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”
MAT.15.13	He replied, 
MAT.15.15	Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.”
MAT.15.21	Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 
MAT.15.22	A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.”
MAT.15.23	Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”
MAT.15.24	He answered, 
MAT.15.25	The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.
MAT.15.26	He replied, 
MAT.15.27	“Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus said to her, 
MAT.15.29	Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. 
MAT.15.30	Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them. 
MAT.15.31	The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.
MAT.15.32	Jesus called his disciples to him and said, 
MAT.15.33	His disciples answered, “Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?”
MAT.15.34	“Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”
MAT.15.35	He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. 
MAT.15.36	Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. 
MAT.15.37	They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 
MAT.15.38	The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children. 
MAT.15.39	After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.
MAT.16.1	The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
MAT.16.2	He replied, 
MAT.16.4	 Jesus then left them and went away.
MAT.16.5	When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread. 
MAT.16.6	 Jesus said to them. 
MAT.16.7	They discussed this among themselves and said, “It is because we didn’t bring any bread.”
MAT.16.8	Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, 
MAT.16.12	Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, 
MAT.16.14	They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
MAT.16.16	Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”
MAT.16.17	Jesus replied, 
MAT.16.20	Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
MAT.16.21	From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
MAT.16.22	Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to you!”
MAT.16.23	Jesus turned and said to Peter, 
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said to his disciples, 
MAT.17.1	After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. 
MAT.17.2	There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. 
MAT.17.3	Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
MAT.17.4	Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
MAT.17.5	While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!”
MAT.17.6	When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified. 
MAT.17.7	But Jesus came and touched them. 
MAT.17.8	When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.
MAT.17.9	As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, 
MAT.17.10	The disciples asked him, “Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?”
MAT.17.11	Jesus replied, 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him. 
MAT.17.15	“Lord, have mercy on my son,” he said. “He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. 
MAT.17.16	I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.”
MAT.17.18	Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment.
MAT.17.19	Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
MAT.17.20	He replied, 
MAT.17.22	When they came together in Galilee, he said to them, 
MAT.17.23	 And the disciples were filled with grief.
MAT.17.24	After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the temple tax?”
MAT.17.25	“Yes, he does,” he replied.
MAT.17.25	When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. 
MAT.17.26	“From others,” Peter answered.
MAT.18.1	At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
MAT.18.2	He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them. 
MAT.18.3	And he said: 
MAT.18.21	Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”
MAT.18.22	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.1	When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. 
MAT.19.2	Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
MAT.19.3	Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?”
MAT.19.7	“Why then,” they asked, “did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?”
MAT.19.8	Jesus replied, 
MAT.19.10	The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.”
MAT.19.11	Jesus replied, 
MAT.19.13	Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them.
MAT.19.14	Jesus said, 
MAT.19.15	When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.
MAT.19.16	Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?”
MAT.19.18	“Which ones?” he inquired.
MAT.19.18	Jesus replied, 
MAT.19.20	“All these I have kept,” the young man said. “What do I still lack?”
MAT.19.21	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.22	When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.
MAT.19.23	Then Jesus said to his disciples, 
MAT.19.25	When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”
MAT.19.26	Jesus looked at them and said, 
MAT.19.27	Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?”
MAT.19.28	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.20.17	Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the Twelve aside and said to them, 
MAT.20.20	Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him.
MAT.20.21	She said, “Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.”
MAT.20.22	“We can,” they answered.
MAT.20.23	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.20.24	When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. 
MAT.20.25	Jesus called them together and said, 
MAT.20.29	As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. 
MAT.20.30	Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
MAT.20.31	The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
MAT.20.32	Jesus stopped and called them. 
MAT.20.33	“Lord,” they answered, “we want our sight.”
MAT.20.34	Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.
MAT.21.1	As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, 
MAT.21.2	saying to them, 
MAT.21.4	This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:
MAT.21.5	“Say to Daughter Zion,
MAT.21.5	‘See, your king comes to you,
MAT.21.5	gentle and riding on a donkey,
MAT.21.5	and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’ ”
MAT.21.6	The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. 
MAT.21.7	They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on. 
MAT.21.8	A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 
MAT.21.9	The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted,
MAT.21.9	“Hosanna
MAT.21.9	“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”
MAT.21.9	“Hosanna
MAT.21.10	When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?”
MAT.21.11	The crowds answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”
MAT.21.12	Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. 
MAT.21.13	 he said to them, 
MAT.21.14	The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. 
MAT.21.15	But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were indignant.
MAT.21.16	“Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him.
MAT.21.17	And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.
MAT.21.18	Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. 
MAT.21.19	Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, 
MAT.21.20	When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they asked.
MAT.21.21	Jesus replied, 
MAT.21.23	Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you this authority?”
MAT.21.24	Jesus replied, 
MAT.21.25	They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 
MAT.21.26	But if we say, ‘Of human origin’—we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.”
MAT.21.27	So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”
MAT.21.27	Then he said, 
MAT.21.31	“The first,” they answered.
MAT.21.31	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.41	“He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.”
MAT.21.42	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was talking about them. 
MAT.21.46	They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.
MAT.22.1	Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: 
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. 
MAT.22.16	They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are. 
MAT.22.17	Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax
MAT.22.18	But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, 
MAT.22.19	 They brought him a denarius, 
MAT.22.20	and he asked them, 
MAT.22.21	“Caesar’s,” they replied.
MAT.22.21	Then he said to them, 
MAT.22.22	When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.
MAT.22.23	That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. 
MAT.22.24	“Teacher,” they said, “Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him. 
MAT.22.25	Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. 
MAT.22.26	The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. 
MAT.22.27	Finally, the woman died. 
MAT.22.28	Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?”
MAT.22.29	Jesus replied, 
MAT.22.33	When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.
MAT.22.34	Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. 
MAT.22.35	One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: 
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
MAT.22.37	Jesus replied: 
MAT.22.41	While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
MAT.22.42	“The son of David,” they replied.
MAT.22.43	He said to them, 
MAT.22.46	No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.
MAT.23.1	Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: 
MAT.24.1	Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. 
MAT.24.2	 he asked. 
MAT.24.3	As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
MAT.24.4	Jesus answered: 
MAT.26.1	When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, 
MAT.26.3	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, 
MAT.26.4	and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. 
MAT.26.5	“But not during the festival,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.”
MAT.26.6	While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper, 
MAT.26.7	a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.
MAT.26.8	When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. “Why this waste?” they asked. 
MAT.26.9	“This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.”
MAT.26.10	Aware of this, Jesus said to them, 
MAT.26.14	Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests 
MAT.26.15	and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?” So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver. 
MAT.26.16	From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
MAT.26.17	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?”
MAT.26.18	He replied, 
MAT.26.19	So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
MAT.26.20	When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. 
MAT.26.21	And while they were eating, he said, 
MAT.26.22	They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely you don’t mean me, Lord?”
MAT.26.23	Jesus replied, 
MAT.26.25	Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely you don’t mean me, Rabbi?”
MAT.26.25	Jesus answered, 
MAT.26.26	While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, 
MAT.26.27	Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, 
MAT.26.30	When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	Then Jesus told them, 
MAT.26.33	Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.”
MAT.26.35	But Peter declared, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the other disciples said the same.
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, 
MAT.26.37	He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. 
MAT.26.38	Then he said to them, 
MAT.26.39	Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, 
MAT.26.40	Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. 
MAT.26.42	He went away a second time and prayed, 
MAT.26.43	When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. 
MAT.26.44	So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
MAT.26.45	Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, 
MAT.26.47	While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. 
MAT.26.48	Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.” 
MAT.26.49	Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
MAT.26.50	Jesus replied, 
MAT.26.50	Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. 
MAT.26.51	With that, one of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
MAT.26.55	In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, 
MAT.26.56	 Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.
MAT.26.57	Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. 
MAT.26.58	But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
MAT.26.59	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. 
MAT.26.60	But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward.
MAT.26.60	Finally two came forward 
MAT.26.61	and declared, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’ ”
MAT.26.62	Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” 
MAT.26.63	But Jesus remained silent.
MAT.26.63	The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. 
MAT.26.66	What do you think?”
MAT.26.66	“He is worthy of death,” they answered.
MAT.26.67	Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him 
MAT.26.68	and said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?”
MAT.26.69	Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said.
MAT.26.70	But he denied it before them all. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.
MAT.26.71	Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
MAT.26.72	He denied it again, with an oath: “I don’t know the man!”
MAT.26.73	After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, “Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.”
MAT.26.74	Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know the man!”
MAT.26.74	Immediately a rooster crowed. 
MAT.26.75	Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: 
MAT.27.1	Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans how to have Jesus executed. 
MAT.27.2	So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
MAT.27.3	When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. 
MAT.27.4	“I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.”
MAT.27.4	“What is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your responsibility.”
MAT.27.5	So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
MAT.27.6	The chief priests picked up the coins and said, “It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.” 
MAT.27.7	So they decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners. 
MAT.27.8	That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 
MAT.27.9	Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, 
MAT.27.10	and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”
MAT.27.11	Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
MAT.27.12	When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. 
MAT.27.13	Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?” 
MAT.27.14	But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor.
MAT.27.15	Now it was the governor’s custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. 
MAT.27.16	At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus
MAT.27.17	So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?” 
MAT.27.18	For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.
MAT.27.19	While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him this message: “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.”
MAT.27.20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
MAT.27.21	“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor.
MAT.27.21	“Barabbas,” they answered.
MAT.27.22	“What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked.
MAT.27.22	They all answered, “Crucify him!”
MAT.27.23	“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.
MAT.27.23	But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”
MAT.27.24	When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”
MAT.27.25	All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”
MAT.27.26	Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
MAT.27.27	Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. 
MAT.27.28	They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, 
MAT.27.29	and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. “Hail, king of the Jews!” they said. 
MAT.27.30	They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. 
MAT.27.31	After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.
MAT.27.32	As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. 
MAT.27.33	They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”). 
MAT.27.34	There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. 
MAT.27.35	When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. 
MAT.27.36	And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. 
MAT.27.37	Above his head they placed the written charge against him: 
MAT.27.38	Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. 
MAT.27.39	Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads 
MAT.27.40	and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!” 
MAT.27.41	In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. 
MAT.27.42	“He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! He’s the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. 
MAT.27.43	He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ” 
MAT.27.44	In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
MAT.27.45	From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land. 
MAT.27.46	About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 
MAT.27.47	When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He’s calling Elijah.”
MAT.27.48	Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. 
MAT.27.49	The rest said, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.”
MAT.27.50	And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
MAT.27.51	At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split 
MAT.27.52	and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. 
MAT.27.53	They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and
MAT.27.54	When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!”
MAT.27.55	Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. 
MAT.27.56	Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph,
MAT.27.57	As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. 
MAT.27.58	Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. 
MAT.27.59	Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
MAT.27.60	and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. 
MAT.27.61	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
MAT.27.62	The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. 
MAT.27.63	“Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ 
MAT.27.64	So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.”
MAT.27.65	“Take a guard,” Pilate answered. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” 
MAT.27.66	So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
MAT.28.1	After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
MAT.28.2	There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. 
MAT.28.3	His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. 
MAT.28.4	The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
MAT.28.5	The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 
MAT.28.6	He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 
MAT.28.7	Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.”
MAT.28.8	So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 
MAT.28.9	Suddenly Jesus met them. 
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.28.11	While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. 
MAT.28.12	When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, 
MAT.28.13	telling them, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.’ 
MAT.28.14	If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” 
MAT.28.15	So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
MAT.28.16	Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 
MAT.28.17	When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 
MAT.28.18	Then Jesus came to them and said, 
MRK.1.1	The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah,
MRK.1.2	as it is written in Isaiah the prophet:
MRK.1.2	“I will send my messenger ahead of you,
MRK.1.2	who will prepare your way”
MRK.1.3	“a voice of one calling in the wilderness,
MRK.1.3	‘Prepare the way for the Lord,
MRK.1.3	make straight paths for him.’ ”
MRK.1.4	And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 
MRK.1.5	The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 
MRK.1.6	John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 
MRK.1.7	And this was his message: “After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 
MRK.1.8	I baptize you with
MRK.1.9	At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 
MRK.1.10	Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. 
MRK.1.11	And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”
MRK.1.12	At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, 
MRK.1.13	and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted
MRK.1.14	After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 
MRK.1.15	 he said. 
MRK.1.16	As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 
MRK.1.17	 Jesus said, 
MRK.1.18	At once they left their nets and followed him.
MRK.1.19	When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. 
MRK.1.20	Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
MRK.1.21	They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. 
MRK.1.22	The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. 
MRK.1.23	Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, 
MRK.1.24	“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
MRK.1.26	The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.
MRK.1.27	The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.” 
MRK.1.28	News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.
MRK.1.29	As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. 
MRK.1.30	Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her. 
MRK.1.31	So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.
MRK.1.32	That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. 
MRK.1.33	The whole town gathered at the door, 
MRK.1.34	and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.
MRK.1.35	Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. 
MRK.1.36	Simon and his companions went to look for him, 
MRK.1.37	and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!”
MRK.1.38	Jesus replied, 
MRK.1.39	So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
MRK.1.40	A man with leprosy
MRK.1.41	Jesus was indignant.
MRK.1.42	Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
MRK.1.43	Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: 
MRK.1.45	Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
MRK.2.1	A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. 
MRK.2.2	They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. 
MRK.2.3	Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. 
MRK.2.4	Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. 
MRK.2.5	When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, 
MRK.2.6	Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, 
MRK.2.7	“Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
MRK.2.8	Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, 
MRK.2.10	 So he said to the man, 
MRK.2.12	He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”
MRK.2.13	Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them. 
MRK.2.14	As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. 
MRK.2.15	While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. 
MRK.2.16	When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
MRK.2.17	On hearing this, Jesus said to them, 
MRK.2.18	Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, “How is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?”
MRK.2.19	Jesus answered, 
MRK.2.23	One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain. 
MRK.2.24	The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”
MRK.2.25	He answered, 
MRK.2.27	Then he said to them, 
MRK.3.1	Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. 
MRK.3.2	Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath. 
MRK.3.3	Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, 
MRK.3.4	Then Jesus asked them, 
MRK.3.5	He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, 
MRK.3.6	Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.
MRK.3.7	Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed. 
MRK.3.8	When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon. 
MRK.3.9	Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him. 
MRK.3.10	For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him. 
MRK.3.11	Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” 
MRK.3.12	But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him.
MRK.3.13	Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. 
MRK.3.14	He appointed twelve
MRK.3.15	and to have authority to drive out demons. 
MRK.3.16	These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter), 
MRK.3.17	James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name 
MRK.3.18	Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot 
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
MRK.3.20	Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. 
MRK.3.21	When his family
MRK.3.22	And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.”
MRK.3.23	So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: 
MRK.3.30	He said this because they were saying, “He has an impure spirit.”
MRK.3.31	Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. 
MRK.3.32	A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.”
MRK.3.34	Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, 
MRK.4.1	Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water’s edge. 
MRK.4.2	He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said: 
MRK.4.9	Then Jesus said, 
MRK.4.10	When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. 
MRK.4.11	He told them, 
MRK.4.13	Then Jesus said to them, 
MRK.4.21	He said to them, 
MRK.4.26	He also said, 
MRK.4.30	Again he said, 
MRK.4.33	With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. 
MRK.4.34	He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.
MRK.4.35	That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, 
MRK.4.36	Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. 
MRK.4.37	A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. 
MRK.4.38	Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?”
MRK.4.39	He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, 
MRK.4.40	He said to his disciples, 
MRK.4.41	They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”
MRK.5.1	They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.
MRK.5.2	When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him. 
MRK.5.3	This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. 
MRK.5.4	For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. 
MRK.5.5	Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.
MRK.5.6	When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. 
MRK.5.7	He shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!” 
MRK.5.8	For Jesus had said to him, 
MRK.5.9	Then Jesus asked him, 
MRK.5.9	“My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.” 
MRK.5.10	And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.
MRK.5.11	A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. 
MRK.5.12	The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.” 
MRK.5.13	He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.
MRK.5.14	Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. 
MRK.5.15	When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 
MRK.5.16	Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well. 
MRK.5.17	Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.
MRK.5.18	As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. 
MRK.5.19	Jesus did not let him, but said, 
MRK.5.20	So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis
MRK.5.21	When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. 
MRK.5.22	Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet. 
MRK.5.23	He pleaded earnestly with him, “My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.” 
MRK.5.24	So Jesus went with him.
MRK.5.24	A large crowd followed and pressed around him. 
MRK.5.25	And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. 
MRK.5.26	She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. 
MRK.5.27	When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, 
MRK.5.28	because she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.” 
MRK.5.29	Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
MRK.5.30	At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, 
MRK.5.31	“You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, 
MRK.5.32	But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. 
MRK.5.33	Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. 
MRK.5.34	He said to her, 
MRK.5.35	While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why bother the teacher anymore?”
MRK.5.36	Overhearing
MRK.5.37	He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. 
MRK.5.38	When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. 
MRK.5.39	He went in and said to them, 
MRK.5.40	But they laughed at him.
MRK.5.40	After he put them all out, he took the child’s father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. 
MRK.5.41	He took her by the hand and said to her, 
MRK.5.42	Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. 
MRK.5.43	He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
MRK.6.1	Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples. 
MRK.6.2	When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed.
MRK.6.2	“Where did this man get these things?” they asked. “What’s this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing? 
MRK.6.3	Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph,
MRK.6.4	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.6.5	He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. 
MRK.6.6	He was amazed at their lack of faith.
MRK.6.6	Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. 
MRK.6.7	Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits.
MRK.6.8	These were his instructions: 
MRK.6.12	They went out and preached that people should repent. 
MRK.6.13	They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.
MRK.6.14	King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known. Some were saying,
MRK.6.15	Others said, “He is Elijah.”
MRK.6.15	And still others claimed, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.”
MRK.6.16	But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!”
MRK.6.17	For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, whom he had married. 
MRK.6.18	For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” 
MRK.6.19	So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, 
MRK.6.20	because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled
MRK.6.21	Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. 
MRK.6.22	When the daughter of
MRK.6.22	The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I’ll give it to you.” 
MRK.6.23	And he promised her with an oath, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.”
MRK.6.24	She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?”
MRK.6.24	“The head of John the Baptist,” she answered.
MRK.6.25	At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”
MRK.6.26	The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. 
MRK.6.27	So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, 
MRK.6.28	and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
MRK.6.30	The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. 
MRK.6.31	Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, 
MRK.6.32	So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. 
MRK.6.33	But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. 
MRK.6.34	When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
MRK.6.35	By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. “This is a remote place,” they said, “and it’s already very late. 
MRK.6.36	Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
MRK.6.37	But he answered, 
MRK.6.37	They said to him, “That would take more than half a year’s wages
MRK.6.38	When they found out, they said, “Five—and two fish.”
MRK.6.39	Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. 
MRK.6.41	Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. 
MRK.6.42	They all ate and were satisfied, 
MRK.6.43	and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. 
MRK.6.44	The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.
MRK.6.45	Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. 
MRK.6.46	After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.
MRK.6.47	Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. 
MRK.6.48	He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, 
MRK.6.49	but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, 
MRK.6.50	because they all saw him and were terrified.
MRK.6.50	Immediately he spoke to them and said, 
MRK.6.51	Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed, 
MRK.6.52	for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.
MRK.6.53	When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there. 
MRK.6.54	As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus. 
MRK.6.55	They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was. 
MRK.6.56	And wherever he went—into villages, towns or countryside—they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
MRK.7.1	The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus 
MRK.7.2	and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. 
MRK.7.3	(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. 
MRK.7.4	When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.
MRK.7.5	So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands?”
MRK.7.6	He replied, 
MRK.7.9	And he continued, 
MRK.7.14	Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, 
MRK.7.17	After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. 
MRK.7.18	 he asked. 
MRK.7.19	 (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)
MRK.7.20	He went on: 
MRK.7.24	Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre.
MRK.7.25	In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet. 
MRK.7.26	The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.
MRK.7.28	“Lord,” she replied, “even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”
MRK.7.29	Then he told her, 
MRK.7.30	She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
MRK.7.31	Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.
MRK.7.32	There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.
MRK.7.33	After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man’s ears. Then he spit and touched the man’s tongue. 
MRK.7.34	He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, 
MRK.7.35	At this, the man’s ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.
MRK.7.36	Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. 
MRK.7.37	People were overwhelmed with amazement. “He has done everything well,” they said. “He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
MRK.8.1	During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said, 
MRK.8.4	His disciples answered, “But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?”
MRK.8.5	“Seven,” they replied.
MRK.8.6	He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people, and they did so. 
MRK.8.7	They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them. 
MRK.8.8	The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 
MRK.8.9	About four thousand were present. After he had sent them away, 
MRK.8.10	he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven. 
MRK.8.12	He sighed deeply and said, 
MRK.8.13	Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.
MRK.8.14	The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. 
MRK.8.15	 Jesus warned them. 
MRK.8.16	They discussed this with one another and said, “It is because we have no bread.”
MRK.8.17	Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: 
MRK.8.19	“Twelve,” they replied.
MRK.8.20	They answered, “Seven.”
MRK.8.21	He said to them, 
MRK.8.22	They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. 
MRK.8.23	He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, 
MRK.8.24	He looked up and said, “I see people; they look like trees walking around.”
MRK.8.25	Once more Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. 
MRK.8.26	Jesus sent him home, saying, 
MRK.8.27	Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, 
MRK.8.28	They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.”
MRK.8.29	Peter answered, “You are the Messiah.”
MRK.8.30	Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
MRK.8.31	He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again. 
MRK.8.32	He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
MRK.8.33	But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. 
MRK.8.34	Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: 
MRK.9.1	And he said to them, 
MRK.9.2	After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. 
MRK.9.3	His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. 
MRK.9.4	And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.
MRK.9.5	Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” 
MRK.9.6	(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)
MRK.9.7	Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!”
MRK.9.8	Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
MRK.9.9	As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 
MRK.9.10	They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what “rising from the dead” meant.
MRK.9.11	And they asked him, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?”
MRK.9.12	Jesus replied, 
MRK.9.14	When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. 
MRK.9.15	As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.
MRK.9.17	A man in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. 
MRK.9.18	Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.”
MRK.9.20	So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
MRK.9.21	Jesus asked the boy’s father, 
MRK.9.21	“From childhood,” he answered. 
MRK.9.22	“It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.”
MRK.9.24	Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!”
MRK.9.25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. 
MRK.9.26	The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He’s dead.” 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.
MRK.9.28	After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
MRK.9.29	He replied, 
MRK.9.30	They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were, 
MRK.9.31	because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, 
MRK.9.32	But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.
MRK.9.33	They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, 
MRK.9.34	But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.
MRK.9.35	Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, 
MRK.9.36	He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, 
MRK.9.38	“Teacher,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.”
MRK.10.1	Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.
MRK.10.2	Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”
MRK.10.4	They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.”
MRK.10.10	When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. 
MRK.10.11	He answered, 
MRK.10.13	People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. 
MRK.10.14	When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, 
MRK.10.16	And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them.
MRK.10.17	As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
MRK.10.20	“Teacher,” he declared, “all these I have kept since I was a boy.”
MRK.10.21	Jesus looked at him and loved him. 
MRK.10.22	At this the man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.
MRK.10.23	Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, 
MRK.10.24	The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, 
MRK.10.26	The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be saved?”
MRK.10.27	Jesus looked at them and said, 
MRK.10.28	Then Peter spoke up, “We have left everything to follow you!”
MRK.10.32	They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. 
MRK.10.33	 he said, 
MRK.10.35	Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. “Teacher,” they said, “we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”
MRK.10.37	They replied, “Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.”
MRK.10.39	“We can,” they answered.
MRK.10.39	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.41	When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. 
MRK.10.42	Jesus called them together and said, 
MRK.10.46	Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means “son of Timaeus”), was sitting by the roadside begging. 
MRK.10.47	When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
MRK.10.48	Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
MRK.10.49	Jesus stopped and said, 
MRK.10.49	So they called to the blind man, “Cheer up! On your feet! He’s calling you.” 
MRK.10.50	Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.
MRK.10.51	The blind man said, “Rabbi, I want to see.”
MRK.11.1	As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples, 
MRK.11.2	saying to them, 
MRK.11.4	They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it, 
MRK.11.5	some people standing there asked, “What are you doing, untying that colt?” 
MRK.11.6	They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. 
MRK.11.7	When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. 
MRK.11.8	Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. 
MRK.11.9	Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted,
MRK.11.9	“Hosanna!
MRK.11.9	“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”
MRK.11.10	“Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!”
MRK.11.10	“Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
MRK.11.11	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
MRK.11.12	The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. 
MRK.11.13	Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. 
MRK.11.14	Then he said to the tree, 
MRK.11.15	On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves, 
MRK.11.16	and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. 
MRK.11.17	And as he taught them, he said, 
MRK.11.18	The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.
MRK.11.19	When evening came, Jesus and his disciples
MRK.11.20	In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. 
MRK.11.21	Peter remembered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!”
MRK.11.27	They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him. 
MRK.11.28	“By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you authority to do this?”
MRK.11.29	Jesus replied, 
MRK.11.31	They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 
MRK.11.32	But if we say, ‘Of human origin’ …” (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)
MRK.11.33	So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”
MRK.11.33	Jesus said, 
MRK.12.1	Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: 
MRK.12.12	Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.
MRK.12.13	Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words. 
MRK.12.14	They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay the imperial tax
MRK.12.15	Should we pay or shouldn’t we?”
MRK.12.15	But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. 
MRK.12.16	They brought the coin, and he asked them, 
MRK.12.16	“Caesar’s,” they replied.
MRK.12.17	Then Jesus said to them, 
MRK.12.17	And they were amazed at him.
MRK.12.18	Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. 
MRK.12.19	“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. 
MRK.12.20	Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children. 
MRK.12.21	The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third. 
MRK.12.22	In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too. 
MRK.12.23	At the resurrection
MRK.12.24	Jesus replied, 
MRK.12.28	One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?”
MRK.12.32	“Well said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. 
MRK.12.33	To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
MRK.12.34	When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, 
MRK.12.35	While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, 
MRK.12.37	The large crowd listened to him with delight.
MRK.12.38	As he taught, Jesus said, 
MRK.12.41	Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. 
MRK.12.42	But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.
MRK.12.43	Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, 
MRK.13.1	As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!”
MRK.13.3	As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately, 
MRK.13.4	“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?”
MRK.13.5	Jesus said to them: 
MRK.14.1	Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were scheming to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. 
MRK.14.2	“But not during the festival,” they said, “or the people may riot.”
MRK.14.3	While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
MRK.14.4	Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, “Why this waste of perfume? 
MRK.14.5	It could have been sold for more than a year’s wages
MRK.14.10	Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. 
MRK.14.11	They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
MRK.14.12	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?”
MRK.14.13	So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, 
MRK.14.16	The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
MRK.14.17	When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. 
MRK.14.18	While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, 
MRK.14.19	They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, “Surely you don’t mean me?”
MRK.14.22	While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, 
MRK.14.23	Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
MRK.14.26	When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MRK.14.29	Peter declared, “Even if all fall away, I will not.”
MRK.14.31	But Peter insisted emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the others said the same.
MRK.14.32	They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, 
MRK.14.33	He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. 
MRK.14.34	 he said to them. 
MRK.14.35	Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. 
MRK.14.37	Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. 
MRK.14.39	Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. 
MRK.14.40	When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.
MRK.14.41	Returning the third time, he said to them, 
MRK.14.43	Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.
MRK.14.44	Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.” 
MRK.14.45	Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him. 
MRK.14.46	The men seized Jesus and arrested him. 
MRK.14.47	Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
MRK.14.50	Then everyone deserted him and fled.
MRK.14.51	A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, 
MRK.14.52	he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.
MRK.14.53	They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and the teachers of the law came together. 
MRK.14.54	Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.
MRK.14.55	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. 
MRK.14.56	Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.
MRK.14.57	Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: 
MRK.14.58	“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made with hands.’ ” 
MRK.14.59	Yet even then their testimony did not agree.
MRK.14.60	Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” 
MRK.14.61	But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.
MRK.14.61	Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?”
MRK.14.63	The high priest tore his clothes. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he asked. 
MRK.14.64	“You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?”
MRK.14.64	They all condemned him as worthy of death. 
MRK.14.65	Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, “Prophesy!” And the guards took him and beat him.
MRK.14.66	While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. 
MRK.14.67	When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him.
MRK.14.67	“You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,” she said.
MRK.14.68	But he denied it. “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about,” he said, and went out into the entryway.
MRK.14.69	When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, “This fellow is one of them.” 
MRK.14.70	Again he denied it.
MRK.14.70	After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.”
MRK.14.71	He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know this man you’re talking about.”
MRK.14.72	Immediately the rooster crowed the second time.
MRK.15.1	Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, made their plans. So they bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.
MRK.15.2	“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate.
MRK.15.3	The chief priests accused him of many things. 
MRK.15.4	So again Pilate asked him, “Aren’t you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.”
MRK.15.5	But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.
MRK.15.6	Now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people requested. 
MRK.15.7	A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. 
MRK.15.8	The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.
MRK.15.9	“Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate, 
MRK.15.10	knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. 
MRK.15.11	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.
MRK.15.12	“What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked them.
MRK.15.13	“Crucify him!” they shouted.
MRK.15.14	“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.
MRK.15.14	But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”
MRK.15.15	Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
MRK.15.16	The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. 
MRK.15.17	They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. 
MRK.15.18	And they began to call out to him, “Hail, king of the Jews!” 
MRK.15.19	Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. 
MRK.15.20	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.
MRK.15.21	A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. 
MRK.15.22	They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”). 
MRK.15.23	Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. 
MRK.15.24	And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.
MRK.15.25	It was nine in the morning when they crucified him. 
MRK.15.26	The written notice of the charge against him read: 
MRK.15.27	They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left. 
MRK.15.29	Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, “So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, 
MRK.15.30	come down from the cross and save yourself!” 
MRK.15.31	In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! 
MRK.15.32	Let this Messiah, this king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
MRK.15.33	At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. 
MRK.15.34	And at three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 
MRK.15.35	When some of those standing near heard this, they said, “Listen, he’s calling Elijah.”
MRK.15.36	Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to take him down,” he said.
MRK.15.37	With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
MRK.15.38	The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 
MRK.15.39	And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died,
MRK.15.40	Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph,
MRK.15.41	In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.
MRK.15.42	It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, 
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. 
MRK.15.44	Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. 
MRK.15.45	When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. 
MRK.15.46	So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. 
MRK.15.47	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.
MRK.16.1	When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body. 
MRK.16.2	Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb 
MRK.16.3	and they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?”
MRK.16.4	But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. 
MRK.16.5	As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.
MRK.16.6	“Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. 
MRK.16.7	But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.’ ”
MRK.16.8	Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.
LUK.1.1	Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled
LUK.1.2	just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 
LUK.1.3	With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 
LUK.1.4	so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
LUK.1.5	In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. 
LUK.1.6	Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s commands and decrees blamelessly. 
LUK.1.7	But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.
LUK.1.8	Once when Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, 
LUK.1.9	he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 
LUK.1.10	And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.
LUK.1.11	Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 
LUK.1.12	When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. 
LUK.1.13	But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. 
LUK.1.14	He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, 
LUK.1.15	for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. 
LUK.1.16	He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. 
LUK.1.17	And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”
LUK.1.18	Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.”
LUK.1.19	The angel said to him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. 
LUK.1.20	And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time.”
LUK.1.21	Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. 
LUK.1.22	When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.
LUK.1.23	When his time of service was completed, he returned home. 
LUK.1.24	After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. 
LUK.1.25	“The Lord has done this for me,” she said. “In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”
LUK.1.26	In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, 
LUK.1.27	to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. 
LUK.1.28	The angel went to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”
LUK.1.29	Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. 
LUK.1.30	But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. 
LUK.1.31	You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. 
LUK.1.32	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 
LUK.1.33	and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.”
LUK.1.34	“How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”
LUK.1.35	The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called
LUK.1.36	Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. 
LUK.1.37	For no word from God will ever fail.”
LUK.1.38	“I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your word to me be fulfilled.” Then the angel left her.
LUK.1.39	At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, 
LUK.1.40	where she entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
LUK.1.42	In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! 
LUK.1.43	But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
LUK.1.44	As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 
LUK.1.45	Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!”
LUK.1.46	And Mary said:
LUK.1.46	“My soul glorifies the Lord
LUK.1.47	and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
LUK.1.48	for he has been mindful
LUK.1.48	of the humble state of his servant.
LUK.1.48	From now on all generations will call me blessed,
LUK.1.49	for the Mighty One has done great things for me—
LUK.1.49	holy is his name.
LUK.1.50	His mercy extends to those who fear him,
LUK.1.50	from generation to generation.
LUK.1.51	He has performed mighty deeds with his arm;
LUK.1.51	he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
LUK.1.52	He has brought down rulers from their thrones
LUK.1.52	but has lifted up the humble.
LUK.1.53	He has filled the hungry with good things
LUK.1.53	but has sent the rich away empty.
LUK.1.54	He has helped his servant Israel,
LUK.1.54	remembering to be merciful
LUK.1.55	to Abraham and his descendants forever,
LUK.1.55	just as he promised our ancestors.”
LUK.1.56	Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
LUK.1.57	When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. 
LUK.1.58	Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.
LUK.1.59	On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, 
LUK.1.60	but his mother spoke up and said, “No! He is to be called John.”
LUK.1.61	They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who has that name.”
LUK.1.62	Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. 
LUK.1.63	He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s astonishment he wrote, “His name is John.” 
LUK.1.64	Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God. 
LUK.1.65	All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things. 
LUK.1.66	Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, “What then is this child going to be?” For the Lord’s hand was with him.
LUK.1.67	His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
LUK.1.68	“Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
LUK.1.68	because he has come to his people and redeemed them.
LUK.1.69	He has raised up a horn
LUK.1.69	in the house of his servant David
LUK.1.70	(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
LUK.1.71	salvation from our enemies
LUK.1.71	and from the hand of all who hate us—
LUK.1.72	to show mercy to our ancestors
LUK.1.72	and to remember his holy covenant,
LUK.1.73	the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
LUK.1.74	to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,
LUK.1.74	and to enable us to serve him without fear
LUK.1.75	in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
LUK.1.76	And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;
LUK.1.76	for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
LUK.1.77	to give his people the knowledge of salvation
LUK.1.77	through the forgiveness of their sins,
LUK.1.78	because of the tender mercy of our God,
LUK.1.78	by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
LUK.1.79	to shine on those living in darkness
LUK.1.79	and in the shadow of death,
LUK.1.79	to guide our feet into the path of peace.”
LUK.1.80	And the child grew and became strong in spirit
LUK.2.1	In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. 
LUK.2.2	(This was the first census that took place while
LUK.2.3	And everyone went to their own town to register.
LUK.2.4	So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 
LUK.2.5	He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. 
LUK.2.6	While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, 
LUK.2.7	and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.
LUK.2.8	And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 
LUK.2.9	An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 
LUK.2.10	But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 
LUK.2.11	Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. 
LUK.2.12	This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”
LUK.2.13	Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
LUK.2.14	“Glory to God in the highest heaven,
LUK.2.14	and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”
LUK.2.15	When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”
LUK.2.16	So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 
LUK.2.17	When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 
LUK.2.18	and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 
LUK.2.19	But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 
LUK.2.20	The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.
LUK.2.21	On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.
LUK.2.22	When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord 
LUK.2.23	(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord”
LUK.2.24	and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: “a pair of doves or two young pigeons.”
LUK.2.25	Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. 
LUK.2.26	It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Messiah. 
LUK.2.27	Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, 
LUK.2.28	Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:
LUK.2.29	“Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,
LUK.2.29	you may now dismiss
LUK.2.30	For my eyes have seen your salvation,
LUK.2.31	which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:
LUK.2.32	a light for revelation to the Gentiles,
LUK.2.32	and the glory of your people Israel.”
LUK.2.33	The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him. 
LUK.2.34	Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: “This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, 
LUK.2.35	so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.”
LUK.2.36	There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, 
LUK.2.37	and then was a widow until she was eighty-four.
LUK.2.38	Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.
LUK.2.39	When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. 
LUK.2.40	And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.
LUK.2.41	Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. 
LUK.2.42	When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom. 
LUK.2.43	After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. 
LUK.2.44	Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. 
LUK.2.45	When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. 
LUK.2.46	After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 
LUK.2.47	Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. 
LUK.2.48	When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.”
LUK.2.50	But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
LUK.2.51	Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. 
LUK.2.52	And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.
LUK.3.1	In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene— 
LUK.3.2	during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. 
LUK.3.3	He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 
LUK.3.4	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet:
LUK.3.4	“A voice of one calling in the wilderness,
LUK.3.4	‘Prepare the way for the Lord,
LUK.3.4	make straight paths for him.
LUK.3.5	Every valley shall be filled in,
LUK.3.5	every mountain and hill made low.
LUK.3.5	The crooked roads shall become straight,
LUK.3.5	the rough ways smooth.
LUK.3.6	And all people will see God’s salvation.’ ”
LUK.3.7	John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
LUK.3.8	Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 
LUK.3.9	The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”
LUK.3.10	“What should we do then?” the crowd asked.
LUK.3.11	John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.”
LUK.3.12	Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?”
LUK.3.13	“Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he told them.
LUK.3.14	Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?”
LUK.3.14	He replied, “Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.”
LUK.3.15	The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. 
LUK.3.16	John answered them all, “I baptize you with
LUK.3.17	His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” 
LUK.3.18	And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.
LUK.3.19	But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother’s wife, and all the other evil things he had done, 
LUK.3.20	Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.
LUK.3.21	When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened 
LUK.3.22	and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”
LUK.3.23	Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph,
LUK.3.23	the son of Heli, 
LUK.3.24	the son of Matthat,
LUK.3.24	the son of Levi, the son of Melki,
LUK.3.24	the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
LUK.3.25	the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos,
LUK.3.25	the son of Nahum, the son of Esli,
LUK.3.25	the son of Naggai, 
LUK.3.26	the son of Maath,
LUK.3.26	the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein,
LUK.3.26	the son of Josek, the son of Joda,
LUK.3.27	the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa,
LUK.3.27	the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,
LUK.3.27	the son of Neri, 
LUK.3.28	the son of Melki,
LUK.3.28	the son of Addi, the son of Cosam,
LUK.3.28	the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,
LUK.3.29	the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer,
LUK.3.29	the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat,
LUK.3.29	the son of Levi, 
LUK.3.30	the son of Simeon,
LUK.3.30	the son of Judah, the son of Joseph,
LUK.3.30	the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
LUK.3.31	the son of Melea, the son of Menna,
LUK.3.31	the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan,
LUK.3.31	the son of David, 
LUK.3.32	the son of Jesse,
LUK.3.32	the son of Obed, the son of Boaz,
LUK.3.32	the son of Salmon,
LUK.3.33	the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram,
LUK.3.33	the son of Hezron, the son of Perez,
LUK.3.33	the son of Judah, 
LUK.3.34	the son of Jacob,
LUK.3.34	the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham,
LUK.3.34	the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
LUK.3.35	the son of Serug, the son of Reu,
LUK.3.35	the son of Peleg, the son of Eber,
LUK.3.35	the son of Shelah, 
LUK.3.36	the son of Cainan,
LUK.3.36	the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem,
LUK.3.36	the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
LUK.3.37	the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch,
LUK.3.37	the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel,
LUK.3.37	the son of Kenan, 
LUK.3.38	the son of Enosh,
LUK.3.38	the son of Seth, the son of Adam,
LUK.3.38	the son of God.
LUK.4.1	Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 
LUK.4.2	where for forty days he was tempted
LUK.4.3	The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”
LUK.4.4	Jesus answered, 
LUK.4.5	The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. 
LUK.4.6	And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. 
LUK.4.7	If you worship me, it will all be yours.”
LUK.4.8	Jesus answered, 
LUK.4.9	The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down from here. 
LUK.4.10	For it is written:
LUK.4.10	“ ‘He will command his angels concerning you
LUK.4.10	to guard you carefully;
LUK.4.11	they will lift you up in their hands,
LUK.4.11	so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’
LUK.4.12	Jesus answered, 
LUK.4.13	When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.
LUK.4.14	Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. 
LUK.4.15	He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.
LUK.4.16	He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, 
LUK.4.17	and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:
LUK.4.20	Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. 
LUK.4.21	He began by saying to them, 
LUK.4.22	All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they asked.
LUK.4.23	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.4.28	All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. 
LUK.4.29	They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. 
LUK.4.30	But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.
LUK.4.31	Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people. 
LUK.4.32	They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority.
LUK.4.33	In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, 
LUK.4.34	“Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
LUK.4.36	All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!” 
LUK.4.37	And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.
LUK.4.38	Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. 
LUK.4.39	So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.
LUK.4.40	At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. 
LUK.4.41	Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.
LUK.4.42	At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. 
LUK.4.43	But he said, 
LUK.4.44	And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
LUK.5.1	One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret,
LUK.5.2	He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. 
LUK.5.3	He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
LUK.5.4	When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, 
LUK.5.5	Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.”
LUK.5.6	When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. 
LUK.5.7	So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
LUK.5.8	When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” 
LUK.5.9	For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, 
LUK.5.10	and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners.
LUK.5.10	Then Jesus said to Simon, 
LUK.5.11	So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.
LUK.5.12	While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy.
LUK.5.13	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. 
LUK.5.14	Then Jesus ordered him, 
LUK.5.15	Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. 
LUK.5.16	But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.
LUK.5.17	One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. 
LUK.5.18	Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. 
LUK.5.19	When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.
LUK.5.20	When Jesus saw their faith, he said, 
LUK.5.21	The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
LUK.5.22	Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, 
LUK.5.24	 So he said to the paralyzed man, 
LUK.5.25	Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God. 
LUK.5.26	Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.”
LUK.5.27	After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. 
LUK.5.28	and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.
LUK.5.29	Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. 
LUK.5.30	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”
LUK.5.31	Jesus answered them, 
LUK.5.33	They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.”
LUK.5.34	Jesus answered, 
LUK.5.36	He told them this parable: 
LUK.6.1	One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels. 
LUK.6.2	Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”
LUK.6.3	Jesus answered them, 
LUK.6.5	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.6.6	On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. 
LUK.6.7	The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. 
LUK.6.8	But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, 
LUK.6.9	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.6.10	He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, 
LUK.6.11	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. 
LUK.6.13	When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: 
LUK.6.14	Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 
LUK.6.15	Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, 
LUK.6.16	Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
LUK.6.17	He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, 
LUK.6.18	who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, 
LUK.6.19	and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.
LUK.6.20	Looking at his disciples, he said:
LUK.6.39	He also told them this parable: 
LUK.7.1	When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum. 
LUK.7.2	There a centurion’s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. 
LUK.7.3	The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. 
LUK.7.4	When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This man deserves to have you do this, 
LUK.7.5	because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.” 
LUK.7.6	So Jesus went with them.
LUK.7.6	He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. 
LUK.7.7	That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. 
LUK.7.8	For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
LUK.7.9	When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, 
LUK.7.10	Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.
LUK.7.11	Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. 
LUK.7.12	As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. 
LUK.7.13	When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, 
LUK.7.14	Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, 
LUK.7.15	The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
LUK.7.16	They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has appeared among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.” 
LUK.7.17	This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.
LUK.7.18	John’s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, 
LUK.7.19	he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”
LUK.7.20	When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’ ”
LUK.7.21	At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. 
LUK.7.22	So he replied to the messengers, 
LUK.7.24	After John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: 
LUK.7.29	(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus’ words, acknowledged that God’s way was right, because they had been baptized by John. 
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)
LUK.7.31	Jesus went on to say, 
LUK.7.36	When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. 
LUK.7.37	A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. 
LUK.7.38	As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.
LUK.7.39	When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”
LUK.7.40	Jesus answered him, 
LUK.7.40	“Tell me, teacher,” he said.
LUK.7.43	Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.”
LUK.7.44	Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, 
LUK.7.48	Then Jesus said to her, 
LUK.7.49	The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”
LUK.7.50	Jesus said to the woman, 
LUK.8.1	After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, 
LUK.8.2	and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; 
LUK.8.3	Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.
LUK.8.4	While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: 
LUK.8.8	When he said this, he called out, 
LUK.8.9	His disciples asked him what this parable meant. 
LUK.8.10	He said, 
LUK.8.19	Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. 
LUK.8.20	Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
LUK.8.21	He replied, 
LUK.8.22	One day Jesus said to his disciples, 
LUK.8.23	As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.
LUK.8.24	The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going to drown!”
LUK.8.24	He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. 
LUK.8.25	 he asked his disciples.
LUK.8.25	In fear and amazement they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”
LUK.8.26	They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes,
LUK.8.27	When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. 
LUK.8.28	When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!” 
LUK.8.29	For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.
LUK.8.30	Jesus asked him, 
LUK.8.30	“Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. 
LUK.8.31	And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.
LUK.8.32	A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. 
LUK.8.33	When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
LUK.8.34	When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, 
LUK.8.35	and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 
LUK.8.36	Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. 
LUK.8.37	Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.
LUK.8.38	The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, 
LUK.8.39	 So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.
LUK.8.40	Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. 
LUK.8.41	Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus’ feet, pleading with him to come to his house 
LUK.8.42	because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying.
LUK.8.42	As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. 
LUK.8.43	And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years,
LUK.8.44	She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
LUK.8.45	When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.”
LUK.8.46	But Jesus said, 
LUK.8.47	Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. 
LUK.8.48	Then he said to her, 
LUK.8.49	While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he said. “Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”
LUK.8.50	Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, 
LUK.8.51	When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child’s father and mother. 
LUK.8.52	Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. 
LUK.8.53	They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. 
LUK.8.54	But he took her by the hand and said, 
LUK.8.55	Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. 
LUK.8.56	Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
LUK.9.1	When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, 
LUK.9.2	and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 
LUK.9.3	He told them: 
LUK.9.6	So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.
LUK.9.7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, 
LUK.9.8	others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. 
LUK.9.9	But Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?” And he tried to see him.
LUK.9.10	When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, 
LUK.9.11	but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.
LUK.9.12	Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.”
LUK.9.13	He replied, 
LUK.9.13	They answered, “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.” 
LUK.9.14	(About five thousand men were there.)
LUK.9.14	But he said to his disciples, 
LUK.9.15	The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. 
LUK.9.16	Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. 
LUK.9.17	They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
LUK.9.18	Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, 
LUK.9.19	They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.”
LUK.9.20	Peter answered, “God’s Messiah.”
LUK.9.21	Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. 
LUK.9.22	And he said, 
LUK.9.23	Then he said to them all: 
LUK.9.28	About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. 
LUK.9.29	As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. 
LUK.9.30	Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. 
LUK.9.31	They spoke about his departure,
LUK.9.32	Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. 
LUK.9.33	As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.)
LUK.9.34	While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 
LUK.9.35	A voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.” 
LUK.9.36	When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.
LUK.9.37	The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. 
LUK.9.38	A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. 
LUK.9.39	A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. 
LUK.9.40	I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.”
LUK.9.42	Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. 
LUK.9.43	And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.
LUK.9.43	While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, 
LUK.9.45	But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.
LUK.9.46	An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. 
LUK.9.47	Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him. 
LUK.9.48	Then he said to them, 
LUK.9.49	“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.”
LUK.9.51	As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.52	And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; 
LUK.9.53	but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.54	When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them
LUK.9.55	But Jesus turned and rebuked them. 
LUK.9.56	Then he and his disciples went to another village.
LUK.9.57	As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”
LUK.9.58	Jesus replied, 
LUK.9.59	He said to another man, 
LUK.9.59	But he replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
LUK.9.60	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.9.61	Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.”
LUK.9.62	Jesus replied, 
LUK.10.1	After this the Lord appointed seventy-two
LUK.10.2	He told them, 
LUK.10.17	The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.”
LUK.10.18	He replied, 
LUK.10.21	At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, 
LUK.10.23	Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, 
LUK.10.25	On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
LUK.10.27	He answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’
LUK.10.29	But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”
LUK.10.30	In reply Jesus said: 
LUK.10.37	The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.”
LUK.10.37	Jesus told him, 
LUK.10.38	As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. 
LUK.10.39	She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”
LUK.11.1	One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”
LUK.11.2	He said to them, 
LUK.11.5	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.11.14	Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. 
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, “By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.” 
LUK.11.16	Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.
LUK.11.17	Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: 
LUK.11.27	As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, “Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.”
LUK.11.28	He replied, 
LUK.11.29	As the crowds increased, Jesus said, 
LUK.11.37	When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. 
LUK.11.38	But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.
LUK.11.39	Then the Lord said to him, 
LUK.11.45	One of the experts in the law answered him, “Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.”
LUK.11.46	Jesus replied, 
LUK.11.53	When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, 
LUK.11.54	waiting to catch him in something he might say.
LUK.12.1	Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: 
LUK.12.13	Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”
LUK.12.14	Jesus replied, 
LUK.12.15	Then he said to them, 
LUK.12.16	And he told them this parable: 
LUK.12.22	Then Jesus said to his disciples: 
LUK.12.41	Peter asked, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?”
LUK.12.42	The Lord answered, 
LUK.12.54	He said to the crowd: 
LUK.13.1	Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 
LUK.13.2	Jesus answered, 
LUK.13.6	Then he told this parable: 
LUK.13.10	On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, 
LUK.13.11	and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. 
LUK.13.12	When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, 
LUK.13.13	Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.
LUK.13.14	Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, “There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.”
LUK.13.15	The Lord answered him, 
LUK.13.17	When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.
LUK.13.18	Then Jesus asked, 
LUK.13.20	Again he asked, 
LUK.13.22	Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.23	Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?”
LUK.13.23	He said to them, 
LUK.13.31	At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, “Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.”
LUK.13.32	He replied, 
LUK.14.1	One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. 
LUK.14.2	There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body. 
LUK.14.3	Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, 
LUK.14.4	But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way.
LUK.14.5	Then he asked them, 
LUK.14.6	And they had nothing to say.
LUK.14.7	When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable: 
LUK.14.12	Then Jesus said to his host, 
LUK.14.15	When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.”
LUK.14.16	Jesus replied: 
LUK.14.25	Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: 
LUK.15.1	Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. 
LUK.15.2	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”
LUK.15.3	Then Jesus told them this parable: 
LUK.15.11	Jesus continued: 
LUK.16.1	Jesus told his disciples: 
LUK.16.14	The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. 
LUK.16.15	He said to them, 
LUK.17.1	Jesus said to his disciples: 
LUK.17.5	The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”
LUK.17.6	He replied, 
LUK.17.11	Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. 
LUK.17.12	As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy
LUK.17.13	and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”
LUK.17.14	When he saw them, he said, 
LUK.17.15	One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. 
LUK.17.16	He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.
LUK.17.17	Jesus asked, 
LUK.17.19	Then he said to him, 
LUK.17.20	Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, 
LUK.17.22	Then he said to his disciples, 
LUK.17.37	“Where, Lord?” they asked.
LUK.17.37	He replied, 
LUK.18.1	Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. 
LUK.18.2	He said: 
LUK.18.6	And the Lord said, 
LUK.18.9	To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: 
LUK.18.15	People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. 
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called the children to him and said, 
LUK.18.18	A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
LUK.18.21	“All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said.
LUK.18.22	When Jesus heard this, he said to him, 
LUK.18.23	When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. 
LUK.18.24	Jesus looked at him and said, 
LUK.18.26	Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?”
LUK.18.27	Jesus replied, 
LUK.18.28	Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!”
LUK.18.31	Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, 
LUK.18.34	The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.
LUK.18.35	As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. 
LUK.18.36	When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. 
LUK.18.37	They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”
LUK.18.38	He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
LUK.18.39	Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
LUK.18.40	Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him, 
LUK.18.41	“Lord, I want to see,” he replied.
LUK.18.42	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.18.43	Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.
LUK.19.1	Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. 
LUK.19.2	A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. 
LUK.19.3	He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. 
LUK.19.4	So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.
LUK.19.5	When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, 
LUK.19.6	So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
LUK.19.7	All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.”
LUK.19.8	But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.”
LUK.19.9	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.19.11	While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. 
LUK.19.12	He said: 
LUK.19.28	After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. 
LUK.19.29	As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, 
LUK.19.32	Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them. 
LUK.19.33	As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?”
LUK.19.34	They replied, “The Lord needs it.”
LUK.19.35	They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it. 
LUK.19.36	As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.
LUK.19.37	When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:
LUK.19.38	“Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!”
LUK.19.38	“Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”
LUK.19.39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”
LUK.19.41	As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it 
LUK.19.42	and said, 
LUK.19.45	When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling. 
LUK.19.46	 he said to them, 
LUK.19.47	Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him. 
LUK.19.48	Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.
LUK.20.1	One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him. 
LUK.20.2	“Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who gave you this authority?”
LUK.20.3	He replied, 
LUK.20.5	They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ 
LUK.20.6	But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”
LUK.20.7	So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.”
LUK.20.8	Jesus said, 
LUK.20.9	He went on to tell the people this parable: 
LUK.20.16	When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!”
LUK.20.17	Jesus looked directly at them and asked, 
LUK.20.19	The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.
LUK.20.20	Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. 
LUK.20.21	So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. 
LUK.20.22	Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
LUK.20.23	He saw through their duplicity and said to them, 
LUK.20.24	“Caesar’s,” they replied.
LUK.20.25	He said to them, 
LUK.20.26	They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.
LUK.20.27	Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. 
LUK.20.28	“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. 
LUK.20.29	Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. 
LUK.20.30	The second 
LUK.20.31	and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. 
LUK.20.32	Finally, the woman died too. 
LUK.20.33	Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?”
LUK.20.34	Jesus replied, 
LUK.20.39	Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said, teacher!” 
LUK.20.40	And no one dared to ask him any more questions.
LUK.20.41	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.20.45	While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, 
LUK.21.1	As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury. 
LUK.21.2	He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. 
LUK.21.3	 he said, 
LUK.21.5	Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said, 
LUK.21.7	“Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?”
LUK.21.8	He replied: 
LUK.21.10	Then he said to them: 
LUK.21.29	He told them this parable: 
LUK.21.37	Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, 
LUK.21.38	and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
LUK.22.1	Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, 
LUK.22.2	and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. 
LUK.22.3	Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. 
LUK.22.4	And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. 
LUK.22.5	They were delighted and agreed to give him money. 
LUK.22.6	He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.
LUK.22.7	Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. 
LUK.22.8	Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, 
LUK.22.9	“Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked.
LUK.22.10	He replied, 
LUK.22.13	They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
LUK.22.14	When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. 
LUK.22.15	And he said to them, 
LUK.22.17	After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, 
LUK.22.19	And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, 
LUK.22.20	In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, 
LUK.22.23	They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.
LUK.22.24	A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. 
LUK.22.25	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.22.33	But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.”
LUK.22.34	Jesus answered, 
LUK.22.35	Then Jesus asked them, 
LUK.22.35	“Nothing,” they answered.
LUK.22.36	He said to them, 
LUK.22.38	The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.”
LUK.22.39	Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. 
LUK.22.40	On reaching the place, he said to them, 
LUK.22.41	He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, 
LUK.22.43	An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. 
LUK.22.44	And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.
LUK.22.45	When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. 
LUK.22.46	 he asked them. 
LUK.22.47	While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, 
LUK.22.48	but Jesus asked him, 
LUK.22.49	When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” 
LUK.22.50	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
LUK.22.51	But Jesus answered, 
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, 
LUK.22.54	Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. 
LUK.22.55	And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. 
LUK.22.56	A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with him.”
LUK.22.57	But he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said.
LUK.22.58	A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.”
LUK.22.58	“Man, I am not!” Peter replied.
LUK.22.59	About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.”
LUK.22.60	Peter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. 
LUK.22.61	The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: 
LUK.22.62	And he went outside and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.63	The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. 
LUK.22.64	They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?” 
LUK.22.65	And they said many other insulting things to him.
LUK.22.66	At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. 
LUK.22.67	“If you are the Messiah,” they said, “tell us.”
LUK.22.67	Jesus answered, 
LUK.22.70	They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?”
LUK.22.70	He replied, 
LUK.22.71	Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.”
LUK.23.1	Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate. 
LUK.23.2	And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah, a king.”
LUK.23.3	So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
LUK.23.4	Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”
LUK.23.5	But they insisted, “He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.”
LUK.23.6	On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. 
LUK.23.7	When he learned that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
LUK.23.8	When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort. 
LUK.23.9	He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. 
LUK.23.10	The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. 
LUK.23.11	Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. 
LUK.23.12	That day Herod and Pilate became friends—before this they had been enemies.
LUK.23.13	Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people, 
LUK.23.14	and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him. 
LUK.23.15	Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. 
LUK.23.16	Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.” 
LUK.23.18	But the whole crowd shouted, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!” 
LUK.23.19	(Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)
LUK.23.20	Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again. 
LUK.23.21	But they kept shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
LUK.23.22	For the third time he spoke to them: “Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.”
LUK.23.23	But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed. 
LUK.23.24	So Pilate decided to grant their demand. 
LUK.23.25	He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.
LUK.23.26	As the soldiers led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. 
LUK.23.27	A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. 
LUK.23.28	Jesus turned and said to them, 
LUK.23.32	Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. 
LUK.23.33	When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left. 
LUK.23.34	Jesus said, 
LUK.23.35	The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is God’s Messiah, the Chosen One.”
LUK.23.36	The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar 
LUK.23.37	and said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”
LUK.23.38	There was a written notice above him, which read: 
LUK.23.39	One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”
LUK.23.40	But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence? 
LUK.23.41	We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”
LUK.23.42	Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.
LUK.23.43	Jesus answered him, 
LUK.23.44	It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, 
LUK.23.45	for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. 
LUK.23.46	Jesus called out with a loud voice, 
LUK.23.47	The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, “Surely this was a righteous man.” 
LUK.23.48	When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away. 
LUK.23.49	But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
LUK.23.50	Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, 
LUK.23.51	who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God. 
LUK.23.52	Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body. 
LUK.23.53	Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. 
LUK.23.54	It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
LUK.23.55	The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. 
LUK.23.56	Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.
LUK.24.1	On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. 
LUK.24.2	They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 
LUK.24.3	but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 
LUK.24.4	While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. 
LUK.24.5	In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? 
LUK.24.6	He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 
LUK.24.7	 ” 
LUK.24.8	Then they remembered his words.
LUK.24.9	When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. 
LUK.24.10	It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. 
LUK.24.11	But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. 
LUK.24.12	Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
LUK.24.13	Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles
LUK.24.14	They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. 
LUK.24.15	As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; 
LUK.24.16	but they were kept from recognizing him.
LUK.24.17	He asked them, 
LUK.24.17	They stood still, their faces downcast. 
LUK.24.18	One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”
LUK.24.19	“About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. 
LUK.24.20	The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; 
LUK.24.21	but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. 
LUK.24.22	In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning 
LUK.24.23	but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. 
LUK.24.24	Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.”
LUK.24.25	He said to them, 
LUK.24.27	And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.
LUK.24.28	As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. 
LUK.24.29	But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.
LUK.24.30	When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. 
LUK.24.31	Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. 
LUK.24.32	They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
LUK.24.33	They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 
LUK.24.34	and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.” 
LUK.24.35	Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
LUK.24.36	While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, 
LUK.24.37	They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. 
LUK.24.38	He said to them, 
LUK.24.40	When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. 
LUK.24.41	And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, 
LUK.24.42	They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 
LUK.24.43	and he took it and ate it in their presence.
LUK.24.44	He said to them, 
LUK.24.45	Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. 
LUK.24.46	He told them, 
LUK.24.50	When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. 
LUK.24.51	While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. 
LUK.24.52	Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. 
LUK.24.53	And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
JHN.1.2	He was with God in the beginning. 
JHN.1.3	Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 
JHN.1.4	In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 
JHN.1.5	The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome
JHN.1.6	There was a man sent from God whose name was John. 
JHN.1.7	He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. 
JHN.1.8	He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.
JHN.1.9	The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. 
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 
JHN.1.11	He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 
JHN.1.12	Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— 
JHN.1.13	children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.
JHN.1.14	The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.
JHN.1.15	(John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, “This is the one I spoke about when I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ ”) 
JHN.1.16	Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. 
JHN.1.17	For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
JHN.1.18	No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and
JHN.1.19	Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders
JHN.1.20	He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.”
JHN.1.21	They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?”
JHN.1.21	He said, “I am not.”
JHN.1.21	“Are you the Prophet?”
JHN.1.21	He answered, “No.”
JHN.1.22	Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
JHN.1.23	John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’ ”
JHN.1.24	Now the Pharisees who had been sent 
JHN.1.25	questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
JHN.1.26	“I baptize with
JHN.1.27	He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.”
JHN.1.28	This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
JHN.1.29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 
JHN.1.30	This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ 
JHN.1.31	I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.”
JHN.1.32	Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. 
JHN.1.33	And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ 
JHN.1.34	I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Chosen One.”
JHN.1.35	The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. 
JHN.1.36	When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”
JHN.1.37	When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.38	Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, 
JHN.1.38	They said, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”
JHN.1.39	So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon.
JHN.1.40	Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.41	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ). 
JHN.1.42	And he brought him to Jesus.
JHN.1.42	Jesus looked at him and said, 
JHN.1.43	The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, 
JHN.1.44	Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. 
JHN.1.45	Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
JHN.1.46	“Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked.
JHN.1.46	“Come and see,” said Philip.
JHN.1.47	When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, 
JHN.1.48	“How do you know me?” Nathanael asked.
JHN.1.48	Jesus answered, 
JHN.1.49	Then Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel.”
JHN.1.50	Jesus said, 
JHN.1.51	He then added, 
JHN.2.1	On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, 
JHN.2.2	and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. 
JHN.2.3	When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.”
JHN.2.5	His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
JHN.2.6	Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.
JHN.2.7	Jesus said to the servants, 
JHN.2.8	Then he told them, 
JHN.2.8	They did so, 
JHN.2.9	and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 
JHN.2.10	and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.”
JHN.2.11	What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
JHN.2.12	After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.
JHN.2.13	When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
JHN.2.14	In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. 
JHN.2.15	So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. 
JHN.2.16	To those who sold doves he said, 
JHN.2.17	His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for your house will consume me.”
JHN.2.18	The Jews then responded to him, “What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?”
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.2.20	They replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?” 
JHN.2.21	But the temple he had spoken of was his body. 
JHN.2.22	After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.
JHN.2.23	Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.
JHN.2.24	But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people. 
JHN.2.25	He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person.
JHN.3.1	Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. 
JHN.3.2	He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.”
JHN.3.3	Jesus replied, 
JHN.3.4	“How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!”
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.9	“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.
JHN.3.16	For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 
JHN.3.17	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 
JHN.3.18	Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 
JHN.3.19	This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 
JHN.3.20	Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 
JHN.3.21	But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.
JHN.3.22	After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. 
JHN.3.23	Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized. 
JHN.3.24	(This was before John was put in prison.) 
JHN.3.25	An argument developed between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. 
JHN.3.26	They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.”
JHN.3.27	To this John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. 
JHN.3.28	You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.’ 
JHN.3.29	The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. 
JHN.3.30	He must become greater; I must become less.”
JHN.3.31	The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. 
JHN.3.32	He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. 
JHN.3.33	Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. 
JHN.3.34	For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. 
JHN.3.36	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them.
JHN.4.1	Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John— 
JHN.4.2	although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. 
JHN.4.3	So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.
JHN.4.4	Now he had to go through Samaria. 
JHN.4.5	So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 
JHN.4.6	Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.
JHN.4.7	When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.8	(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)
JHN.4.9	The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered her, 
JHN.4.11	“Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? 
JHN.4.12	Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?”
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered, 
JHN.4.15	The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”
JHN.4.16	He told her, 
JHN.4.17	“I have no husband,” she replied.
JHN.4.17	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.19	“Sir,” the woman said, “I can see that you are a prophet. 
JHN.4.20	Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.”
JHN.4.25	The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.”
JHN.4.26	Then Jesus declared, 
JHN.4.27	Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”
JHN.4.28	Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, 
JHN.4.29	“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” 
JHN.4.30	They came out of the town and made their way toward him.
JHN.4.31	Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.”
JHN.4.32	But he said to them, 
JHN.4.33	Then his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him food?”
JHN.4.39	Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” 
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. 
JHN.4.41	And because of his words many more became believers.
JHN.4.42	They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”
JHN.4.43	After the two days he left for Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) 
JHN.4.45	When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there.
JHN.4.46	Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. 
JHN.4.47	When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.
JHN.4.49	The royal official said, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”
JHN.4.50	The man took Jesus at his word and departed. 
JHN.4.51	While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. 
JHN.4.52	When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, “Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him.”
JHN.4.53	Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, 
JHN.4.54	This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.
JHN.5.1	Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals. 
JHN.5.2	Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda
JHN.5.3	Here a great number of disabled people used to lie—the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. 
JHN.5.5	One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, 
JHN.5.7	“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.”
JHN.5.8	Then Jesus said to him, 
JHN.5.9	At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.
JHN.5.9	The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, 
JHN.5.10	and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.”
JHN.5.11	But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, 
JHN.5.12	So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?”
JHN.5.13	The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
JHN.5.14	Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, 
JHN.5.15	The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.
JHN.5.16	So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him. 
JHN.5.17	In his defense Jesus said to them, 
JHN.5.18	For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
JHN.5.19	Jesus gave them this answer: 
JHN.6.1	Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), 
JHN.6.2	and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick. 
JHN.6.3	Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. 
JHN.6.4	The Jewish Passover Festival was near.
JHN.6.5	When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, 
JHN.6.6	He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.
JHN.6.7	Philip answered him, “It would take more than half a year’s wages
JHN.6.8	Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up, 
JHN.6.9	“Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?”
JHN.6.10	Jesus said, 
JHN.6.11	Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.
JHN.6.12	When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, 
JHN.6.13	So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
JHN.6.14	After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, “Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.” 
JHN.6.15	Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.
JHN.6.16	When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, 
JHN.6.17	where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. 
JHN.6.18	A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. 
JHN.6.19	When they had rowed about three or four miles,
JHN.6.20	But he said to them, 
JHN.6.21	Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.
JHN.6.22	The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. 
JHN.6.23	Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 
JHN.6.24	Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.
JHN.6.25	When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.28	Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?”
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.30	So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? 
JHN.6.31	Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’
JHN.6.32	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.34	“Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.”
JHN.6.35	Then Jesus declared, 
JHN.6.41	At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, 
JHN.6.42	They said, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 
JHN.6.52	Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
JHN.6.53	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.59	He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?”
JHN.6.61	Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.64	 For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. 
JHN.6.65	He went on to say, 
JHN.6.66	From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.
JHN.6.68	Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 
JHN.6.69	We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.”
JHN.6.70	Then Jesus replied, 
JHN.6.71	(He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)
JHN.7.1	After this, Jesus went around in Galilee. He did not want
JHN.7.2	But when the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near, 
JHN.7.3	Jesus’ brothers said to him, “Leave Galilee and go to Judea, so that your disciples there may see the works you do. 
JHN.7.4	No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.” 
JHN.7.5	For even his own brothers did not believe in him.
JHN.7.6	Therefore Jesus told them, 
JHN.7.9	After he had said this, he stayed in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went also, not publicly, but in secret. 
JHN.7.11	Now at the festival the Jewish leaders were watching for Jesus and asking, “Where is he?”
JHN.7.12	Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, “He is a good man.”
JHN.7.12	Others replied, “No, he deceives the people.” 
JHN.7.13	But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders.
JHN.7.14	Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach. 
JHN.7.15	The Jews there were amazed and asked, “How did this man get such learning without having been taught?”
JHN.7.16	Jesus answered, 
JHN.7.20	“You are demon-possessed,” the crowd answered. “Who is trying to kill you?”
JHN.7.21	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.7.25	At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill? 
JHN.7.26	Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah? 
JHN.7.27	But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from.”
JHN.7.28	Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, 
JHN.7.30	At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. 
JHN.7.31	Still, many in the crowd believed in him. They said, “When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?”
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.
JHN.7.33	Jesus said, 
JHN.7.35	The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 
JHN.7.36	What did he mean when he said, 
JHN.7.37	On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, 
JHN.7.39	By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.
JHN.7.40	On hearing his words, some of the people said, “Surely this man is the Prophet.”
JHN.7.41	Others said, “He is the Messiah.”
JHN.7.41	Still others asked, “How can the Messiah come from Galilee? 
JHN.7.42	Does not Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David’s descendants and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?” 
JHN.7.43	Thus the people were divided because of Jesus. 
JHN.7.44	Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.
JHN.7.45	Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring him in?”
JHN.7.46	“No one ever spoke the way this man does,” the guards replied.
JHN.7.47	“You mean he has deceived you also?” the Pharisees retorted. 
JHN.7.48	“Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him? 
JHN.7.49	No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them.”
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, 
JHN.7.51	“Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?”
JHN.7.52	They replied, “Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.”
JHN.8.12	When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, 
JHN.8.13	The Pharisees challenged him, “Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.”
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.19	Then they asked him, “Where is your father?”
JHN.8.20	He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.
JHN.8.21	Once more Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.22	This made the Jews ask, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 
JHN.8.23	But he continued, 
JHN.8.25	“Who are you?” they asked.
JHN.8.27	They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. 
JHN.8.28	So Jesus said, 
JHN.8.30	Even as he spoke, many believed in him.
JHN.8.31	To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, 
JHN.8.33	They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?”
JHN.8.34	Jesus replied, 
JHN.8.39	“Abraham is our father,” they answered.
JHN.8.41	“We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.”
JHN.8.42	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.48	The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?”
JHN.8.52	At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. 
JHN.8.53	Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”
JHN.8.54	Jesus replied, 
JHN.8.57	“You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”
JHN.8.59	At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
JHN.9.1	As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. 
JHN.9.2	His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
JHN.9.6	After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes. 
JHN.9.7	 he told him, 
JHN.9.8	His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?” 
JHN.9.9	Some claimed that he was.
JHN.9.9	Others said, “No, he only looks like him.”
JHN.9.9	But he himself insisted, “I am the man.”
JHN.9.10	“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked.
JHN.9.11	He replied, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”
JHN.9.12	“Where is this man?” they asked him.
JHN.9.12	“I don’t know,” he said.
JHN.9.13	They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. 
JHN.9.14	Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a Sabbath. 
JHN.9.15	Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. “He put mud on my eyes,” the man replied, “and I washed, and now I see.”
JHN.9.16	Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.”
JHN.9.16	But others asked, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So they were divided.
JHN.9.17	Then they turned again to the blind man, “What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.”
JHN.9.17	The man replied, “He is a prophet.”
JHN.9.18	They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man’s parents. 
JHN.9.19	“Is this your son?” they asked. “Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?”
JHN.9.20	“We know he is our son,” the parents answered, “and we know he was born blind. 
JHN.9.21	But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.” 
JHN.9.22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. 
JHN.9.23	That was why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”
JHN.9.24	A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. “Give glory to God by telling the truth,” they said. “We know this man is a sinner.”
JHN.9.25	He replied, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!”
JHN.9.26	Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
JHN.9.27	He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?”
JHN.9.28	Then they hurled insults at him and said, “You are this fellow’s disciple! We are disciples of Moses! 
JHN.9.29	We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don’t even know where he comes from.”
JHN.9.30	The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. 
JHN.9.31	We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will. 
JHN.9.32	Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. 
JHN.9.33	If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
JHN.9.34	To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!” And they threw him out.
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, 
JHN.9.36	“Who is he, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in him.”
JHN.9.37	Jesus said, 
JHN.9.38	Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
JHN.9.39	Jesus said,
JHN.9.40	Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, “What? Are we blind too?”
JHN.9.41	Jesus said, 
JHN.10.6	Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them.
JHN.10.7	Therefore Jesus said again, 
JHN.10.19	The Jews who heard these words were again divided. 
JHN.10.20	Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?”
JHN.10.21	But others said, “These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
JHN.10.22	Then came the Festival of Dedication
JHN.10.23	and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade. 
JHN.10.24	The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered, 
JHN.10.31	Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him, 
JHN.10.32	but Jesus said to them, 
JHN.10.33	“We are not stoning you for any good work,” they replied, “but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.”
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.39	Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.
JHN.10.40	Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. There he stayed, 
JHN.10.41	and many people came to him. They said, “Though John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true.” 
JHN.10.42	And in that place many believed in Jesus.
JHN.11.1	Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 
JHN.11.2	(This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.) 
JHN.11.3	So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”
JHN.11.4	When he heard this, Jesus said, 
JHN.11.5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
JHN.11.6	So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days, 
JHN.11.7	and then he said to his disciples, 
JHN.11.8	“But Rabbi,” they said, “a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you, and yet you are going back?”
JHN.11.9	Jesus answered, 
JHN.11.11	After he had said this, he went on to tell them, 
JHN.11.12	His disciples replied, “Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.” 
JHN.11.13	Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.
JHN.11.14	So then he told them plainly, 
JHN.11.16	Then Thomas (also known as Didymus
JHN.11.17	On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. 
JHN.11.18	Now Bethany was less than two miles
JHN.11.19	and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother. 
JHN.11.20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.
JHN.11.21	“Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
JHN.11.22	But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.”
JHN.11.23	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.24	Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”
JHN.11.25	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.27	“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.”
JHN.11.28	After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. “The Teacher is here,” she said, “and is asking for you.” 
JHN.11.29	When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. 
JHN.11.30	Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. 
JHN.11.31	When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.
JHN.11.32	When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
JHN.11.33	When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. 
JHN.11.34	 he asked.
JHN.11.34	“Come and see, Lord,” they replied.
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept.
JHN.11.36	Then the Jews said, “See how he loved him!”
JHN.11.37	But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”
JHN.11.38	Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. 
JHN.11.39	 he said.
JHN.11.39	“But, Lord,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.”
JHN.11.40	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.11.41	So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, 
JHN.11.43	When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, 
JHN.11.44	The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face.
JHN.11.44	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.11.45	Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him. 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 
JHN.11.47	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.
JHN.11.47	“What are we accomplishing?” they asked. “Here is this man performing many signs. 
JHN.11.48	If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.”
JHN.11.49	Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, “You know nothing at all! 
JHN.11.50	You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”
JHN.11.51	He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 
JHN.11.52	and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 
JHN.11.53	So from that day on they plotted to take his life.
JHN.11.54	Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
JHN.11.55	When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. 
JHN.11.56	They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, “What do you think? Isn’t he coming to the festival at all?” 
JHN.11.57	But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.
JHN.12.1	Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.2	Here a dinner was given in Jesus’ honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. 
JHN.12.3	Then Mary took about a pint
JHN.12.4	But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, 
JHN.12.5	“Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year’s wages.
JHN.12.6	He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.
JHN.12.9	Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.10	So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, 
JHN.12.11	for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him.
JHN.12.12	The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. 
JHN.12.13	They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting,
JHN.12.13	“Hosanna!
JHN.12.13	“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”
JHN.12.13	“Blessed is the king of Israel!”
JHN.12.14	Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written:
JHN.12.15	“Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion;
JHN.12.15	see, your king is coming,
JHN.12.15	seated on a donkey’s colt.”
JHN.12.16	At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him.
JHN.12.17	Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. 
JHN.12.18	Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him. 
JHN.12.19	So the Pharisees said to one another, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!”
JHN.12.20	Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival. 
JHN.12.21	They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. “Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.” 
JHN.12.22	Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.
JHN.12.23	Jesus replied, 
JHN.12.28	Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.” 
JHN.12.29	The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.
JHN.12.30	Jesus said, 
JHN.12.33	He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.
JHN.12.34	The crowd spoke up, “We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, 
JHN.12.35	Then Jesus told them, 
JHN.12.36	 When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.
JHN.12.37	Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. 
JHN.12.38	This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet:
JHN.12.38	“Lord, who has believed our message
JHN.12.38	and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
JHN.12.39	For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:
JHN.12.40	“He has blinded their eyes
JHN.12.40	and hardened their hearts,
JHN.12.40	so they can neither see with their eyes,
JHN.12.40	nor understand with their hearts,
JHN.12.40	nor turn—and I would heal them.”
JHN.12.41	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.
JHN.12.42	Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; 
JHN.12.43	for they loved human praise more than praise from God.
JHN.12.44	Then Jesus cried out, 
JHN.13.1	It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
JHN.13.2	The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. 
JHN.13.3	Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; 
JHN.13.4	so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. 
JHN.13.5	After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
JHN.13.6	He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”
JHN.13.7	Jesus replied, 
JHN.13.8	“No,” said Peter, “you shall never wash my feet.”
JHN.13.8	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.9	“Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!”
JHN.13.10	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.11	For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.
JHN.13.12	When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. 
JHN.13.21	After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, 
JHN.13.22	His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant. 
JHN.13.23	One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him. 
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, “Ask him which one he means.”
JHN.13.25	Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, “Lord, who is it?”
JHN.13.26	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.27	As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.
JHN.13.27	So Jesus told him, 
JHN.13.28	But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. 
JHN.13.29	Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor. 
JHN.13.30	As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.
JHN.13.31	When he was gone, Jesus said, 
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter asked him, “Lord, where are you going?”
JHN.13.36	Jesus replied, 
JHN.13.37	Peter asked, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
JHN.13.38	Then Jesus answered, 
JHN.14.5	Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”
JHN.14.6	Jesus answered, 
JHN.14.8	Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.”
JHN.14.9	Jesus answered: 
JHN.14.22	Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?”
JHN.14.23	Jesus replied, 
JHN.16.16	Jesus went on to say, 
JHN.16.17	At this, some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying, 
JHN.16.18	They kept asking, “What does he mean by 
JHN.16.19	Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, 
JHN.16.29	Then Jesus’ disciples said, “Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. 
JHN.16.30	Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.”
JHN.17.1	After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed:
JHN.18.1	When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it.
JHN.18.2	Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. 
JHN.18.3	So Judas came to the garden, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.
JHN.18.4	Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, 
JHN.18.5	“Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied.
JHN.18.6	When Jesus said, 
JHN.18.7	Again he asked them, 
JHN.18.7	“Jesus of Nazareth,” they said.
JHN.18.8	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.9	This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: 
JHN.18.10	Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant’s name was Malchus.)
JHN.18.11	Jesus commanded Peter, 
JHN.18.12	Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him 
JHN.18.13	and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. 
JHN.18.14	Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people.
JHN.18.15	Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard, 
JHN.18.16	but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there and brought Peter in.
JHN.18.17	“You aren’t one of this man’s disciples too, are you?” she asked Peter.
JHN.18.17	He replied, “I am not.”
JHN.18.18	It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.
JHN.18.19	Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
JHN.18.22	When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face. “Is this the way you answer the high priest?” he demanded.
JHN.18.24	Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
JHN.18.25	Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself. So they asked him, “You aren’t one of his disciples too, are you?”
JHN.18.25	He denied it, saying, “I am not.”
JHN.18.26	One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, “Didn’t I see you with him in the garden?” 
JHN.18.27	Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.
JHN.18.28	Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace, because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. 
JHN.18.29	So Pilate came out to them and asked, “What charges are you bringing against this man?”
JHN.18.30	“If he were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed him over to you.”
JHN.18.31	Pilate said, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.”
JHN.18.31	“But we have no right to execute anyone,” they objected. 
JHN.18.32	This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die.
JHN.18.33	Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
JHN.18.35	“Am I a Jew?” Pilate replied. “Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What is it you have done?”
JHN.18.36	Jesus said, 
JHN.18.37	“You are a king, then!” said Pilate.
JHN.18.37	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.38	“What is truth?” retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, “I find no basis for a charge against him. 
JHN.18.39	But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release ‘the king of the Jews’?”
JHN.18.40	They shouted back, “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!” Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising.
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. 
JHN.19.2	The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe 
JHN.19.3	and went up to him again and again, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” And they slapped him in the face.
JHN.19.4	Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.” 
JHN.19.5	When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”
JHN.19.6	As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, “Crucify! Crucify!”
JHN.19.6	But Pilate answered, “You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.”
JHN.19.7	The Jewish leaders insisted, “We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.”
JHN.19.8	When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, 
JHN.19.9	and he went back inside the palace. “Where do you come from?” he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. 
JHN.19.10	“Do you refuse to speak to me?” Pilate said. “Don’t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?”
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered, 
JHN.19.12	From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, “If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.”
JHN.19.13	When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge’s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). 
JHN.19.14	It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon.
JHN.19.14	“Here is your king,” Pilate said to the Jews.
JHN.19.15	But they shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!”
JHN.19.15	“Shall I crucify your king?” Pilate asked.
JHN.19.15	“We have no king but Caesar,” the chief priests answered.
JHN.19.16	Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.
JHN.19.16	So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. 
JHN.19.17	Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). 
JHN.19.18	There they crucified him, and with him two others—one on each side and Jesus in the middle.
JHN.19.19	Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: 
JHN.19.20	Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. 
JHN.19.21	The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.”
JHN.19.22	Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
JHN.19.23	When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
JHN.19.24	“Let’s not tear it,” they said to one another. “Let’s decide by lot who will get it.”
JHN.19.24	This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said,
JHN.19.24	“They divided my clothes among them
JHN.19.24	and cast lots for my garment.”
JHN.19.24	So this is what the soldiers did.
JHN.19.25	Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 
JHN.19.26	When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, 
JHN.19.27	and to the disciple, 
JHN.19.28	Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, 
JHN.19.29	A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus’ lips. 
JHN.19.30	When he had received the drink, Jesus said, 
JHN.19.31	Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. 
JHN.19.32	The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. 
JHN.19.33	But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 
JHN.19.34	Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. 
JHN.19.35	The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. 
JHN.19.36	These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken,”
JHN.19.37	and, as another scripture says, “They will look on the one they have pierced.”
JHN.19.38	Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate’s permission, he came and took the body away. 
JHN.19.39	He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.
JHN.19.40	Taking Jesus’ body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs. 
JHN.19.41	At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid. 
JHN.19.42	Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
JHN.20.1	Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. 
JHN.20.2	So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him!”
JHN.20.3	So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 
JHN.20.5	He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in. 
JHN.20.6	Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, 
JHN.20.7	as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus’ head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen. 
JHN.20.8	Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. 
JHN.20.9	(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.) 
JHN.20.10	Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.
JHN.20.11	Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb 
JHN.20.12	and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus’ body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.
JHN.20.13	They asked her, “Woman, why are you crying?”
JHN.20.13	“They have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I don’t know where they have put him.” 
JHN.20.14	At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.
JHN.20.15	He asked her, 
JHN.20.15	Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.”
JHN.20.16	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.16	She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”).
JHN.20.17	Jesus said, 
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them that he had said these things to her.
JHN.20.19	On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 
JHN.20.20	After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
JHN.20.21	Again Jesus said, 
JHN.20.22	And with that he breathed on them and said, 
JHN.20.24	Now Thomas (also known as Didymus
JHN.20.25	So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!”
JHN.20.25	But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”
JHN.20.26	A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 
JHN.20.27	Then he said to Thomas, 
JHN.20.28	Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”
JHN.20.29	Then Jesus told him, 
JHN.20.30	Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. 
JHN.20.31	But these are written that you may believe
JHN.21.1	Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Galilee.
JHN.21.2	Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus
JHN.21.3	“I’m going out to fish,” Simon Peter told them, and they said, “We’ll go with you.” So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
JHN.21.4	Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.
JHN.21.5	He called out to them, 
JHN.21.5	“No,” they answered.
JHN.21.6	He said, 
JHN.21.7	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, “It is the Lord,” he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. 
JHN.21.8	The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.
JHN.21.9	When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.
JHN.21.10	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.21.11	So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. 
JHN.21.12	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.21.13	Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. 
JHN.21.14	This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.
JHN.21.15	When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 
JHN.21.15	“Yes, Lord,” he said, “you know that I love you.”
JHN.21.15	Jesus said, 
JHN.21.16	Again Jesus said, 
JHN.21.16	He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”
JHN.21.16	Jesus said, 
JHN.21.17	The third time he said to him, 
JHN.21.17	Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, 
JHN.21.17	Jesus said, 
JHN.21.19	Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, 
JHN.21.20	Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”) 
JHN.21.21	When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”
JHN.21.22	Jesus answered, 
JHN.21.23	Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, 
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.
JHN.21.25	Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.
ACT.1.1	In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 
ACT.1.2	until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 
ACT.1.3	After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 
ACT.1.4	On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: 
ACT.1.6	Then they gathered around him and asked him, “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”
ACT.1.7	He said to them: 
ACT.1.9	After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.
ACT.1.10	They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. 
ACT.1.11	“Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.”
ACT.1.12	Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day’s walk
ACT.1.13	When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. 
ACT.1.14	They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
ACT.1.15	In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty) 
ACT.1.16	and said, “Brothers and sisters,
ACT.1.17	He was one of our number and shared in our ministry.”
ACT.1.18	(With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. 
ACT.1.19	Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
ACT.1.20	“For,” said Peter, “it is written in the Book of Psalms:
ACT.1.20	“ ‘May his place be deserted;
ACT.1.20	let there be no one to dwell in it,’
ACT.1.20	and,
ACT.1.20	“ ‘May another take his place of leadership.’
ACT.1.21	Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us, 
ACT.1.22	beginning from John’s baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.”
ACT.1.23	So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. 
ACT.1.24	Then they prayed, “Lord, you know everyone’s heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen 
ACT.1.25	to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.” 
ACT.1.26	Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.
ACT.2.1	When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. 
ACT.2.2	Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
ACT.2.3	They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. 
ACT.2.4	All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues
ACT.2.5	Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. 
ACT.2.6	When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken. 
ACT.2.7	Utterly amazed, they asked: “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans? 
ACT.2.8	Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language? 
ACT.2.9	Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
ACT.2.10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome 
ACT.2.11	(both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!” 
ACT.2.12	Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, “What does this mean?”
ACT.2.13	Some, however, made fun of them and said, “They have had too much wine.”
ACT.2.14	Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: “Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. 
ACT.2.15	These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning! 
ACT.2.16	No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
ACT.2.17	“ ‘In the last days, God says,
ACT.2.17	I will pour out my Spirit on all people.
ACT.2.17	Your sons and daughters will prophesy,
ACT.2.17	your young men will see visions,
ACT.2.17	your old men will dream dreams.
ACT.2.18	Even on my servants, both men and women,
ACT.2.18	I will pour out my Spirit in those days,
ACT.2.18	and they will prophesy.
ACT.2.19	I will show wonders in the heavens above
ACT.2.19	and signs on the earth below,
ACT.2.19	blood and fire and billows of smoke.
ACT.2.20	The sun will be turned to darkness
ACT.2.20	and the moon to blood
ACT.2.20	before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.
ACT.2.21	And everyone who calls
ACT.2.21	on the name of the Lord will be saved.’
ACT.2.22	“Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. 
ACT.2.23	This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men,
ACT.2.24	But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. 
ACT.2.25	David said about him:
ACT.2.25	“ ‘I saw the Lord always before me.
ACT.2.25	Because he is at my right hand,
ACT.2.25	I will not be shaken.
ACT.2.26	Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
ACT.2.26	my body also will rest in hope,
ACT.2.27	because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,
ACT.2.27	you will not let your holy one see decay.
ACT.2.28	You have made known to me the paths of life;
ACT.2.28	you will fill me with joy in your presence.’
ACT.2.29	“Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. 
ACT.2.30	But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. 
ACT.2.31	Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay. 
ACT.2.32	God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it. 
ACT.2.33	Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. 
ACT.2.34	For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said,
ACT.2.34	“ ‘The Lord said to my Lord:
ACT.2.34	“Sit at my right hand
ACT.2.35	until I make your enemies
ACT.2.35	a footstool for your feet.” ’
ACT.2.36	“Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”
ACT.2.37	When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
ACT.2.38	Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.2.39	The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”
ACT.2.40	With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.” 
ACT.2.41	Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
ACT.2.42	They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. 
ACT.2.43	Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. 
ACT.2.44	All the believers were together and had everything in common. 
ACT.2.45	They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. 
ACT.2.46	Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, 
ACT.2.47	praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
ACT.3.1	One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon. 
ACT.3.2	Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. 
ACT.3.3	When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. 
ACT.3.4	Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, “Look at us!” 
ACT.3.5	So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.
ACT.3.6	Then Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” 
ACT.3.7	Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong. 
ACT.3.8	He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. 
ACT.3.9	When all the people saw him walking and praising God, 
ACT.3.10	they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
ACT.3.11	While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade. 
ACT.3.12	When Peter saw this, he said to them: “Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? 
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go. 
ACT.3.14	You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you. 
ACT.3.15	You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this. 
ACT.3.16	By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see.
ACT.3.17	“Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. 
ACT.3.18	But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer. 
ACT.3.19	Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, 
ACT.3.20	and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus. 
ACT.3.21	Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets. 
ACT.3.22	For Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you. 
ACT.3.23	Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.’
ACT.3.24	“Indeed, beginning with Samuel, all the prophets who have spoken have foretold these days. 
ACT.3.25	And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham, ‘Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.’
ACT.3.26	When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”
ACT.4.1	The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people. 
ACT.4.2	They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. 
ACT.4.3	They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day. 
ACT.4.4	But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.
ACT.4.5	The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. 
ACT.4.6	Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family. 
ACT.4.7	They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?”
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people! 
ACT.4.9	If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, 
ACT.4.10	then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. 
ACT.4.11	Jesus is
ACT.4.11	“ ‘the stone you builders rejected,
ACT.4.11	which has become the cornerstone.’
ACT.4.12	Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”
ACT.4.13	When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus. 
ACT.4.14	But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say. 
ACT.4.15	So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together. 
ACT.4.16	“What are we going to do with these men?” they asked. “Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it. 
ACT.4.17	But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.”
ACT.4.18	Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John replied, “Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges! 
ACT.4.20	As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”
ACT.4.21	After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. 
ACT.4.22	For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.
ACT.4.23	On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. 
ACT.4.24	When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. “Sovereign Lord,” they said, “you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them. 
ACT.4.25	You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David:
ACT.4.25	“ ‘Why do the nations rage
ACT.4.25	and the peoples plot in vain?
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth rise up
ACT.4.26	and the rulers band together
ACT.4.26	against the Lord
ACT.4.26	and against his anointed one.
ACT.4.27	Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. 
ACT.4.28	They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen. 
ACT.4.29	Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. 
ACT.4.30	Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
ACT.4.31	After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
ACT.4.32	All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. 
ACT.4.33	With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God’s grace was so powerfully at work in them all 
ACT.4.34	that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales 
ACT.4.35	and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need.
ACT.4.36	Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means “son of encouragement”), 
ACT.4.37	sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles’ feet.
ACT.5.1	Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. 
ACT.5.2	With his wife’s full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles’ feet.
ACT.5.3	Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? 
ACT.5.4	Didn’t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God.”
ACT.5.5	When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. 
ACT.5.6	Then some young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.
ACT.5.7	About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	Peter asked her, “Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?”
ACT.5.8	“Yes,” she said, “that is the price.”
ACT.5.9	Peter said to her, “How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.”
ACT.5.10	At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
ACT.5.11	Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.
ACT.5.12	The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon’s Colonnade. 
ACT.5.13	No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people. 
ACT.5.14	Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number. 
ACT.5.15	As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. 
ACT.5.16	Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed.
ACT.5.17	Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. 
ACT.5.18	They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. 
ACT.5.19	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out. 
ACT.5.20	“Go, stand in the temple courts,” he said, “and tell the people all about this new life.”
ACT.5.21	At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people.
ACT.5.21	When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles. 
ACT.5.22	But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported, 
ACT.5.23	“We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.” 
ACT.5.24	On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss, wondering what this might lead to.
ACT.5.25	Then someone came and said, “Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people.” 
ACT.5.26	At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them.
ACT.5.27	The apostles were brought in and made to appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest. 
ACT.5.28	“We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man’s blood.”
ACT.5.29	Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God rather than human beings! 
ACT.5.30	The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by hanging him on a cross. 
ACT.5.31	God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins. 
ACT.5.32	We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”
ACT.5.33	When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death. 
ACT.5.34	But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. 
ACT.5.35	Then he addressed the Sanhedrin: “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. 
ACT.5.36	Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. 
ACT.5.37	After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. 
ACT.5.38	Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. 
ACT.5.39	But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.”
ACT.5.40	His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
ACT.5.41	The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. 
ACT.5.42	Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.
ACT.6.1	In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Hellenistic Jews
ACT.6.2	So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, “It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. 
ACT.6.3	Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them 
ACT.6.4	and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.”
ACT.6.5	This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. 
ACT.6.6	They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
ACT.6.7	So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.
ACT.6.8	Now Stephen, a man full of God’s grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. 
ACT.6.9	Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)—Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia—who began to argue with Stephen. 
ACT.6.10	But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke.
ACT.6.11	Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, “We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.”
ACT.6.12	So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. 
ACT.6.13	They produced false witnesses, who testified, “This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. 
ACT.6.14	For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us.”
ACT.6.15	All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are these charges true?”
ACT.7.2	To this he replied: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Harran. 
ACT.7.3	‘Leave your country and your people,’ God said, ‘and go to the land I will show you.’
ACT.7.4	“So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Harran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living. 
ACT.7.5	He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. 
ACT.7.6	God spoke to him in this way: ‘For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated. 
ACT.7.7	But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ God said, ‘and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.’
ACT.7.8	Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.
ACT.7.9	“Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him 
ACT.7.10	and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt. So Pharaoh made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace.
ACT.7.11	“Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food. 
ACT.7.12	When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers on their first visit. 
ACT.7.13	On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family. 
ACT.7.14	After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. 
ACT.7.15	Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our ancestors died. 
ACT.7.16	Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money.
ACT.7.17	“As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt had greatly increased. 
ACT.7.18	Then ‘a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.’
ACT.7.19	He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die.
ACT.7.20	“At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child.
ACT.7.21	When he was placed outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. 
ACT.7.22	Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.
ACT.7.23	“When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his own people, the Israelites. 
ACT.7.24	He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian. 
ACT.7.25	Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. 
ACT.7.26	The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?’
ACT.7.27	“But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us? 
ACT.7.28	Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’
ACT.7.29	When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons.
ACT.7.30	“After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. 
ACT.7.31	When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to get a closer look, he heard the Lord say: 
ACT.7.32	‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.’
ACT.7.33	“Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. 
ACT.7.34	I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.’
ACT.7.35	“This is the same Moses they had rejected with the words, ‘Who made you ruler and judge?’ He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. 
ACT.7.36	He led them out of Egypt and performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the wilderness.
ACT.7.37	“This is the Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people.’
ACT.7.38	He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to us.
ACT.7.39	“But our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. 
ACT.7.40	They told Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt—we don’t know what has happened to him!’
ACT.7.41	That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and reveled in what their own hands had made. 
ACT.7.42	But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon and stars. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets:
ACT.7.42	“ ‘Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings
ACT.7.42	forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?
ACT.7.43	You have taken up the tabernacle of Molek
ACT.7.43	and the star of your god Rephan,
ACT.7.43	the idols you made to worship.
ACT.7.43	Therefore I will send you into exile’
ACT.7.44	“Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen. 
ACT.7.45	After receiving the tabernacle, our ancestors under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David, 
ACT.7.46	who enjoyed God’s favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
ACT.7.47	But it was Solomon who built a house for him.
ACT.7.48	“However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says:
ACT.7.49	“ ‘Heaven is my throne,
ACT.7.49	and the earth is my footstool.
ACT.7.49	What kind of house will you build for me?
ACT.7.49	says the Lord.
ACT.7.49	Or where will my resting place be?
ACT.7.50	Has not my hand made all these things?’
ACT.7.51	“You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit! 
ACT.7.52	Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him— 
ACT.7.53	you who have received the law that was given through angels but have not obeyed it.”
ACT.7.54	When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. 
ACT.7.55	But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 
ACT.7.56	“Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”
ACT.7.57	At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, 
ACT.7.58	dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
ACT.7.59	While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” 
ACT.7.60	Then he fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he fell asleep.
ACT.8.1	And Saul approved of their killing him.
ACT.8.1	On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. 
ACT.8.2	Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. 
ACT.8.3	But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison.
ACT.8.4	Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. 
ACT.8.5	Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there. 
ACT.8.6	When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he performed, they all paid close attention to what he said. 
ACT.8.7	For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. 
ACT.8.8	So there was great joy in that city.
ACT.8.9	Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great, 
ACT.8.10	and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, “This man is rightly called the Great Power of God.” 
ACT.8.11	They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his sorcery. 
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
ACT.8.13	Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.
ACT.8.14	When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to Samaria. 
ACT.8.15	When they arrived, they prayed for the new believers there that they might receive the Holy Spirit, 
ACT.8.16	because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.8.17	Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
ACT.8.18	When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money 
ACT.8.19	and said, “Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.8.20	Peter answered: “May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! 
ACT.8.21	You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. 
ACT.8.22	Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. 
ACT.8.23	For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.”
ACT.8.24	Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.”
ACT.8.25	After they had further proclaimed the word of the Lord and testified about Jesus, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.
ACT.8.26	Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Go south to the road—the desert road—that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” 
ACT.8.27	So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian
ACT.8.28	and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah the prophet. 
ACT.8.29	The Spirit told Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay near it.”
ACT.8.30	Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked.
ACT.8.31	“How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
ACT.8.32	This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading:
ACT.8.32	“He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,
ACT.8.32	and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,
ACT.8.32	so he did not open his mouth.
ACT.8.33	In his humiliation he was deprived of justice.
ACT.8.33	Who can speak of his descendants?
ACT.8.33	For his life was taken from the earth.”
ACT.8.34	The eunuch asked Philip, “Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?” 
ACT.8.35	Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
ACT.8.36	As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?” 
ACT.8.38	And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. 
ACT.8.40	Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
ACT.9.1	Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples. He went to the high priest 
ACT.9.2	and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.3	As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 
ACT.9.4	He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, 
ACT.9.5	“Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked.
ACT.9.7	The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. 
ACT.9.8	Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.
ACT.9.10	In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, 
ACT.9.10	“Yes, Lord,” he answered.
ACT.9.11	The Lord told him, 
ACT.9.13	“Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.14	And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.”
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said to Ananias, 
ACT.9.17	Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” 
ACT.9.18	Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, 
ACT.9.19	and after taking some food, he regained his strength.
ACT.9.19	Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. 
ACT.9.20	At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. 
ACT.9.21	All those who heard him were astonished and asked, “Isn’t he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?” 
ACT.9.22	Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.
ACT.9.23	After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him, 
ACT.9.24	but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him. 
ACT.9.25	But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.
ACT.9.26	When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. 
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.9.28	So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. 
ACT.9.29	He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews,
ACT.9.30	When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
ACT.9.31	Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.
ACT.9.32	As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord’s people who lived in Lydda. 
ACT.9.33	There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years. 
ACT.9.34	“Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and roll up your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up. 
ACT.9.35	All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
ACT.9.36	In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (in Greek her name is Dorcas); she was always doing good and helping the poor. 
ACT.9.37	About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room. 
ACT.9.38	Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, “Please come at once!”
ACT.9.39	Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.
ACT.9.40	Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up. 
ACT.9.41	He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive. 
ACT.9.42	This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.
ACT.10.1	At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. 
ACT.10.2	He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly. 
ACT.10.3	One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, “Cornelius!”
ACT.10.4	Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked.
ACT.10.4	The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. 
ACT.10.5	Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. 
ACT.10.6	He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.”
ACT.10.7	When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. 
ACT.10.8	He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. 
ACT.10.10	He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. 
ACT.10.11	He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. 
ACT.10.12	It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles and birds. 
ACT.10.13	Then a voice told him, 
ACT.10.14	“Surely not, Lord!” Peter replied. “I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.”
ACT.10.15	The voice spoke to him a second time, 
ACT.10.16	This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.
ACT.10.17	While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon’s house was and stopped at the gate. 
ACT.10.18	They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.
ACT.10.19	While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Simon, three
ACT.10.20	So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.”
ACT.10.21	Peter went down and said to the men, “I’m the one you’re looking for. Why have you come?”
ACT.10.22	The men replied, “We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to ask you to come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.” 
ACT.10.23	Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests.
ACT.10.23	The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the believers from Joppa went along. 
ACT.10.24	The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. 
ACT.10.25	As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. 
ACT.10.26	But Peter made him get up. “Stand up,” he said, “I am only a man myself.”
ACT.10.27	While talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. 
ACT.10.28	He said to them: “You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean. 
ACT.10.29	So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?”
ACT.10.30	Cornelius answered: “Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me 
ACT.10.31	and said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. 
ACT.10.32	Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.’ 
ACT.10.33	So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.”
ACT.10.34	Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism 
ACT.10.35	but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right. 
ACT.10.36	You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. 
ACT.10.37	You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— 
ACT.10.38	how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
ACT.10.39	“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, 
ACT.10.40	but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. 
ACT.10.41	He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 
ACT.10.42	He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. 
ACT.10.43	All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”
ACT.10.44	While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. 
ACT.10.45	The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles. 
ACT.10.46	For they heard them speaking in tongues
ACT.10.46	Then Peter said, 
ACT.10.47	“Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.” 
ACT.10.48	So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
ACT.11.1	The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 
ACT.11.2	So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him 
ACT.11.3	and said, “You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.”
ACT.11.4	Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story: 
ACT.11.5	“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was. 
ACT.11.6	I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds. 
ACT.11.7	Then I heard a voice telling me, 
ACT.11.8	“I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’
ACT.11.9	“The voice spoke from heaven a second time, 
ACT.11.10	This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.
ACT.11.11	“Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. 
ACT.11.12	The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house. 
ACT.11.13	He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. 
ACT.11.14	He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’
ACT.11.15	“As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning. 
ACT.11.16	Then I remembered what the Lord had said: 
ACT.11.17	So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God’s way?”
ACT.11.18	When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, “So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.”
ACT.11.19	Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews. 
ACT.11.20	Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.11.21	The Lord’s hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
ACT.11.22	News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
ACT.11.23	When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. 
ACT.11.24	He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.
ACT.11.25	Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, 
ACT.11.26	and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.
ACT.11.27	During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) 
ACT.11.29	The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea. 
ACT.11.30	This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.
ACT.12.1	It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them. 
ACT.12.2	He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword. 
ACT.12.3	When he saw that this met with approval among the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread. 
ACT.12.4	After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.
ACT.12.5	So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.
ACT.12.6	The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance. 
ACT.12.7	Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains fell off Peter’s wrists.
ACT.12.8	Then the angel said to him, “Put on your clothes and sandals.” And Peter did so. “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me,” the angel told him. 
ACT.12.9	Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision. 
ACT.12.10	They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.
ACT.12.11	Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod’s clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen.”
ACT.12.12	When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying. 
ACT.12.13	Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer the door. 
ACT.12.14	When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, “Peter is at the door!”
ACT.12.15	“You’re out of your mind,” they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, “It must be his angel.”
ACT.12.16	But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. 
ACT.12.17	Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. “Tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this,” he said, and then he left for another place.
ACT.12.18	In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. 
ACT.12.19	After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed.
ACT.12.19	Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there. 
ACT.12.20	He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. After securing the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because they depended on the king’s country for their food supply.
ACT.12.21	On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. 
ACT.12.22	They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.” 
ACT.12.23	Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.
ACT.12.24	But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.
ACT.12.25	When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from
ACT.13.1	Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. 
ACT.13.2	While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” 
ACT.13.3	So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.
ACT.13.4	The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper.
ACT.13.6	They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, 
ACT.13.7	who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.8	But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith. 
ACT.13.9	Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said, 
ACT.13.10	“You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord? 
ACT.13.11	Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun.”
ACT.13.11	Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. 
ACT.13.12	When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.
ACT.13.13	From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem. 
ACT.13.14	From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down. 
ACT.13.15	After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.”
ACT.13.16	Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: “Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me! 
ACT.13.17	The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power he led them out of that country; 
ACT.13.18	for about forty years he endured their conduct
ACT.13.19	and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance. 
ACT.13.20	All this took about 450 years.
ACT.13.20	“After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. 
ACT.13.21	Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years. 
ACT.13.22	After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’
ACT.13.23	“From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised. 
ACT.13.24	Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel. 
ACT.13.25	As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’
ACT.13.26	“Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. 
ACT.13.27	The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. 
ACT.13.28	Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed. 
ACT.13.29	When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb. 
ACT.13.30	But God raised him from the dead, 
ACT.13.31	and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people.
ACT.13.32	“We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors 
ACT.13.33	he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm:
ACT.13.33	“ ‘You are my son;
ACT.13.33	today I have become your father.’
ACT.13.34	God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said,
ACT.13.34	“ ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’
ACT.13.35	So it is also stated elsewhere:
ACT.13.35	“ ‘You will not let your holy one see decay.’
ACT.13.36	“Now when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed. 
ACT.13.37	But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.
ACT.13.38	“Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. 
ACT.13.39	Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses. 
ACT.13.40	Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you:
ACT.13.41	“ ‘Look, you scoffers,
ACT.13.41	wonder and perish,
ACT.13.41	for I am going to do something in your days
ACT.13.41	that you would never believe,
ACT.13.41	even if someone told you.’
ACT.13.42	As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath. 
ACT.13.43	When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
ACT.13.44	On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. 
ACT.13.45	When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him.
ACT.13.46	Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles. 
ACT.13.47	For this is what the Lord has commanded us:
ACT.13.47	“ ‘I have made you
ACT.13.47	that you
ACT.13.48	When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.
ACT.13.49	The word of the Lord spread through the whole region. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region. 
ACT.13.51	So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium. 
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
ACT.14.1	At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed. 
ACT.14.2	But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. 
ACT.14.3	So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders. 
ACT.14.4	The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles. 
ACT.14.5	There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them. 
ACT.14.6	But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country, 
ACT.14.7	where they continued to preach the gospel.
ACT.14.8	In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked. 
ACT.14.9	He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed 
ACT.14.10	and called out, “Stand up on your feet!” At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.
ACT.14.11	When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!” 
ACT.14.12	Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker. 
ACT.14.13	The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.
ACT.14.14	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting: 
ACT.14.15	“Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them. 
ACT.14.16	In the past, he let all nations go their own way. 
ACT.14.17	Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.” 
ACT.14.18	Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.
ACT.14.19	Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead. 
ACT.14.20	But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.
ACT.14.21	They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch, 
ACT.14.22	strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. “We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,” they said. 
ACT.14.23	Paul and Barnabas appointed elders
ACT.14.24	After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia, 
ACT.14.25	and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
ACT.14.26	From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed. 
ACT.14.27	On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. 
ACT.14.28	And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
ACT.15.1	Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.” 
ACT.15.2	This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. 
ACT.15.3	The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the believers very glad. 
ACT.15.4	When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.
ACT.15.5	Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses.”
ACT.15.6	The apostles and elders met to consider this question. 
ACT.15.7	After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. 
ACT.15.8	God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. 
ACT.15.9	He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. 
ACT.15.10	Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? 
ACT.15.11	No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”
ACT.15.12	The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. 
ACT.15.13	When they finished, James spoke up. “Brothers,” he said, “listen to me. 
ACT.15.14	Simon
ACT.15.15	The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:
ACT.15.16	“ ‘After this I will return
ACT.15.16	and rebuild David’s fallen tent.
ACT.15.16	Its ruins I will rebuild,
ACT.15.16	and I will restore it,
ACT.15.17	that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,
ACT.15.17	even all the Gentiles who bear my name,
ACT.15.17	says the Lord, who does these things’
ACT.15.18	things known from long ago.
ACT.15.19	“It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. 
ACT.15.20	Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. 
ACT.15.21	For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”
ACT.15.22	Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers. 
ACT.15.23	With them they sent the following letter:
ACT.15.23	The apostles and elders, your brothers,
ACT.15.23	To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia:
ACT.15.23	Greetings.
ACT.15.24	We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. 
ACT.15.25	So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul— 
ACT.15.26	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.15.27	Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. 
ACT.15.28	It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: 
ACT.15.29	You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things.
ACT.15.29	Farewell.
ACT.15.30	So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter. 
ACT.15.31	The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message. 
ACT.15.32	Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers. 
ACT.15.33	After spending some time there, they were sent off by the believers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them. 
ACT.15.35	But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord.
ACT.15.36	Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.” 
ACT.15.37	Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, 
ACT.15.38	but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. 
ACT.15.39	They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, 
ACT.15.40	but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord. 
ACT.15.41	He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
ACT.16.1	Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.2	The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. 
ACT.16.3	Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.4	As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. 
ACT.16.5	So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.
ACT.16.6	Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia. 
ACT.16.7	When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to. 
ACT.16.8	So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. 
ACT.16.9	During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” 
ACT.16.10	After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
ACT.16.11	From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis. 
ACT.16.12	From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district
ACT.16.13	On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there. 
ACT.16.14	One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message. 
ACT.16.15	When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. “If you consider me a believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us.
ACT.16.16	Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. 
ACT.16.17	She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.” 
ACT.16.18	She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her.
ACT.16.19	When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. 
ACT.16.20	They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar 
ACT.16.21	by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”
ACT.16.22	The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods. 
ACT.16.23	After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. 
ACT.16.24	When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. 
ACT.16.26	Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose. 
ACT.16.27	The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. 
ACT.16.28	But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!”
ACT.16.29	The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. 
ACT.16.30	He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
ACT.16.31	They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.” 
ACT.16.32	Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. 
ACT.16.33	At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized. 
ACT.16.34	The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.
ACT.16.35	When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: “Release those men.” 
ACT.16.36	The jailer told Paul, “The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.”
ACT.16.37	But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”
ACT.16.38	The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed. 
ACT.16.39	They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city. 
ACT.16.40	After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they left.
ACT.17.1	When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. 
ACT.17.2	As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 
ACT.17.3	explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,” he said. 
ACT.17.4	Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.
ACT.17.5	But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.
ACT.17.6	But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, 
ACT.17.7	and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.” 
ACT.17.8	When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. 
ACT.17.9	Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.
ACT.17.10	As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. 
ACT.17.11	Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. 
ACT.17.12	As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. 
ACT.17.14	The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. 
ACT.17.15	Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.
ACT.17.16	While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. 
ACT.17.17	So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. 
ACT.17.18	A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. 
ACT.17.19	Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? 
ACT.17.20	You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean.” 
ACT.17.21	(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)
ACT.17.22	Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. 
ACT.17.23	For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: 
ACT.17.24	“The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. 
ACT.17.25	And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. 
ACT.17.26	From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. 
ACT.17.27	God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us. 
ACT.17.28	‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’
ACT.17.29	“Therefore since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill. 
ACT.17.30	In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. 
ACT.17.31	For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”
ACT.17.32	When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this subject.” 
ACT.17.33	At that, Paul left the Council. 
ACT.17.34	Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.
ACT.18.1	After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 
ACT.18.2	There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them, 
ACT.18.3	and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them. 
ACT.18.4	Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
ACT.18.5	When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. 
ACT.18.6	But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”
ACT.18.7	Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. 
ACT.18.8	Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.
ACT.18.9	One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: 
ACT.18.11	So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.
ACT.18.12	While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment. 
ACT.18.13	“This man,” they charged, “is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.”
ACT.18.14	Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, “If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you. 
ACT.18.15	But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law—settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.” 
ACT.18.16	So he drove them off. 
ACT.18.17	Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever.
ACT.18.18	Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken. 
ACT.18.19	They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. 
ACT.18.20	When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined. 
ACT.18.21	But as he left, he promised, “I will come back if it is God’s will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus. 
ACT.18.22	When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.
ACT.18.23	After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
ACT.18.24	Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. 
ACT.18.25	He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor
ACT.18.26	He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.
ACT.18.27	When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed. 
ACT.18.28	For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.
ACT.19.1	While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples 
ACT.19.2	and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when
ACT.19.2	They answered, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
ACT.19.3	So Paul asked, “Then what baptism did you receive?”
ACT.19.3	“John’s baptism,” they replied.
ACT.19.4	Paul said, “John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” 
ACT.19.5	On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.19.6	When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues
ACT.19.7	There were about twelve men in all.
ACT.19.8	Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. 
ACT.19.9	But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. 
ACT.19.10	This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.
ACT.19.11	God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, 
ACT.19.12	so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.
ACT.19.13	Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.” 
ACT.19.14	Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. 
ACT.19.15	One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?” 
ACT.19.16	Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.
ACT.19.17	When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. 
ACT.19.18	Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done. 
ACT.19.19	A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.
ACT.19.20	In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.
ACT.19.21	After all this had happened, Paul decided
ACT.19.22	He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.
ACT.19.23	About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. 
ACT.19.24	A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there. 
ACT.19.25	He called them together, along with the workers in related trades, and said: “You know, my friends, that we receive a good income from this business. 
ACT.19.26	And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all. 
ACT.19.27	There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited; and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.”
ACT.19.28	When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
ACT.19.29	Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia, and all of them rushed into the theater together. 
ACT.19.30	Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. 
ACT.19.31	Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater.
ACT.19.32	The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there. 
ACT.19.33	The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander to the front, and they shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people. 
ACT.19.34	But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
ACT.19.35	The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: “Fellow Ephesians, doesn’t all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? 
ACT.19.36	Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to calm down and not do anything rash. 
ACT.19.37	You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess. 
ACT.19.38	If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges. 
ACT.19.39	If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly. 
ACT.19.40	As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of what happened today. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.” 
ACT.19.41	After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said goodbye and set out for Macedonia. 
ACT.20.2	He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece, 
ACT.20.3	where he stayed three months. Because some Jews had plotted against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia. 
ACT.20.4	He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. 
ACT.20.5	These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas. 
ACT.20.6	But we sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days.
ACT.20.7	On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight. 
ACT.20.8	There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting. 
ACT.20.9	Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead. 
ACT.20.10	Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. “Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “He’s alive!” 
ACT.20.11	Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left. 
ACT.20.12	The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.
ACT.20.13	We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot. 
ACT.20.14	When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Chios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus. 
ACT.20.16	Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.
ACT.20.17	From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church. 
ACT.20.18	When they arrived, he said to them: “You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia. 
ACT.20.19	I served the Lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe testing by the plots of my Jewish opponents. 
ACT.20.20	You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house. 
ACT.20.21	I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.
ACT.20.22	“And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. 
ACT.20.23	I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me. 
ACT.20.24	However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God’s grace.
ACT.20.25	“Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again. 
ACT.20.26	Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you. 
ACT.20.27	For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God. 
ACT.20.28	Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God,
ACT.20.29	I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. 
ACT.20.30	Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them. 
ACT.20.31	So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
ACT.20.32	“Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. 
ACT.20.33	I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing. 
ACT.20.34	You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions. 
ACT.20.35	In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: 
ACT.20.36	When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed. 
ACT.20.37	They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him. 
ACT.20.38	What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
ACT.21.1	After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Kos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara. 
ACT.21.2	We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board and set sail. 
ACT.21.3	After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it, we sailed on to Syria. We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo. 
ACT.21.4	We sought out the disciples there and stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.5	When it was time to leave, we left and continued on our way. All of them, including wives and children, accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach we knelt to pray. 
ACT.21.6	After saying goodbye to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home.
ACT.21.7	We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and sisters and stayed with them for a day. 
ACT.21.8	Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven. 
ACT.21.9	He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
ACT.21.10	After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 
ACT.21.11	Coming over to us, he took Paul’s belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘In this way the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’ ”
ACT.21.12	When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.13	Then Paul answered, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” 
ACT.21.14	When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, “The Lord’s will be done.”
ACT.21.15	After this, we started on our way up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples.
ACT.21.17	When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters received us warmly. 
ACT.21.18	The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present. 
ACT.21.19	Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
ACT.21.20	When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul: “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law. 
ACT.21.21	They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs. 
ACT.21.22	What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come, 
ACT.21.23	so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow. 
ACT.21.24	Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law. 
ACT.21.25	As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.”
ACT.21.26	The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them.
ACT.21.27	When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him, 
ACT.21.28	shouting, “Fellow Israelites, help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.” 
ACT.21.29	(They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.)
ACT.21.30	The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut. 
ACT.21.31	While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar. 
ACT.21.32	He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
ACT.21.33	The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done. 
ACT.21.34	Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. 
ACT.21.35	When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers. 
ACT.21.36	The crowd that followed kept shouting, “Get rid of him!”
ACT.21.37	As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?”
ACT.21.37	“Do you speak Greek?” he replied. 
ACT.21.38	“Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the wilderness some time ago?”
ACT.21.39	Paul answered, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please let me speak to the people.”
ACT.21.40	After receiving the commander’s permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic
ACT.22.1	“Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense.”
ACT.22.2	When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet.
ACT.22.2	Then Paul said: 
ACT.22.3	“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today. 
ACT.22.4	I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison, 
ACT.22.5	as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.
ACT.22.6	“About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me. 
ACT.22.7	I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, 
ACT.22.8	“ ‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked.
ACT.22.8	“ 
ACT.22.9	My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.
ACT.22.10	“ ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ I asked.
ACT.22.10	“ 
ACT.22.11	My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.
ACT.22.12	“A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there. 
ACT.22.13	He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I was able to see him.
ACT.22.14	“Then he said: ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth. 
ACT.22.15	You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard. 
ACT.22.16	And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.’
ACT.22.17	“When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance 
ACT.22.18	and saw the Lord speaking to me. 
ACT.22.19	“ ‘Lord,’ I replied, ‘these people know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you. 
ACT.22.20	And when the blood of your martyr
ACT.22.21	“Then the Lord said to me, 
ACT.22.22	The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He’s not fit to live!”
ACT.22.23	As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air, 
ACT.22.24	the commander ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and interrogated in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this. 
ACT.22.25	As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn’t even been found guilty?”
ACT.22.26	When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. “What are you going to do?” he asked. “This man is a Roman citizen.”
ACT.22.27	The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”
ACT.22.27	“Yes, I am,” he answered.
ACT.22.28	Then the commander said, “I had to pay a lot of money for my citizenship.”
ACT.22.28	“But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied.
ACT.22.29	Those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.
ACT.22.30	The commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews. So the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the members of the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.
ACT.23.1	Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, “My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.” 
ACT.23.2	At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. 
ACT.23.3	Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!”
ACT.23.4	Those who were standing near Paul said, “How dare you insult God’s high priest!”
ACT.23.5	Paul replied, “Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’
ACT.23.6	Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from Pharisees. I stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead.” 
ACT.23.7	When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. 
ACT.23.8	(The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees believe all these things.)
ACT.23.9	There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. “We find nothing wrong with this man,” they said. “What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?” 
ACT.23.10	The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.
ACT.23.11	The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, 
ACT.23.12	The next morning some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. 
ACT.23.13	More than forty men were involved in this plot. 
ACT.23.14	They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul. 
ACT.23.15	Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here.”
ACT.23.16	But when the son of Paul’s sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.
ACT.23.17	Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.” 
ACT.23.18	So he took him to the commander.
ACT.23.18	The centurion said, “Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”
ACT.23.19	The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, “What is it you want to tell me?”
ACT.23.20	He said: “Some Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him. 
ACT.23.21	Don’t give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request.”
ACT.23.22	The commander dismissed the young man with this warning: “Don’t tell anyone that you have reported this to me.”
ACT.23.23	Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, “Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen
ACT.23.24	Provide horses for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.”
ACT.23.25	He wrote a letter as follows:
ACT.23.26	Claudius Lysias,
ACT.23.26	To His Excellency, Governor Felix:
ACT.23.26	Greetings.
ACT.23.27	This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen. 
ACT.23.28	I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin. 
ACT.23.29	I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment. 
ACT.23.30	When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.
ACT.23.31	So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris. 
ACT.23.32	The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks. 
ACT.23.33	When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him. 
ACT.23.34	The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia, 
ACT.23.35	he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers get here.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.
ACT.24.1	Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor. 
ACT.24.2	When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: “We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation. 
ACT.24.3	Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude. 
ACT.24.4	But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.
ACT.24.5	“We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect 
ACT.24.6	and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him. 
ACT.24.8	By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.”
ACT.24.9	The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.
ACT.24.10	When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense. 
ACT.24.11	You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 
ACT.24.12	My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. 
ACT.24.13	And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me. 
ACT.24.14	However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets, 
ACT.24.15	and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. 
ACT.24.16	So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.
ACT.24.17	“After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings. 
ACT.24.18	I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance. 
ACT.24.19	But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me. 
ACT.24.20	Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin— 
ACT.24.21	unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’ ”
ACT.24.22	Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. “When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.” 
ACT.24.23	He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.
ACT.24.24	Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus. 
ACT.24.25	As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, “That’s enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.” 
ACT.24.26	At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.
ACT.24.27	When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.
ACT.25.1	Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem, 
ACT.25.2	where the chief priests and the Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul. 
ACT.25.3	They requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way. 
ACT.25.4	Festus answered, “Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon. 
ACT.25.5	Let some of your leaders come with me, and if the man has done anything wrong, they can press charges against him there.”
ACT.25.6	After spending eight or ten days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him. 
ACT.25.7	When Paul came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him. They brought many serious charges against him, but they could not prove them.
ACT.25.8	Then Paul made his defense: “I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar.”
ACT.25.9	Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?”
ACT.25.10	Paul answered: “I am now standing before Caesar’s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well. 
ACT.25.11	If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”
ACT.25.12	After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared: “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!”
ACT.25.13	A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus. 
ACT.25.14	Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul’s case with the king. He said: “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner. 
ACT.25.15	When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned.
ACT.25.16	“I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over anyone before they have faced their accusers and have had an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges. 
ACT.25.17	When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in. 
ACT.25.18	When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected. 
ACT.25.19	Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive. 
ACT.25.20	I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges. 
ACT.25.21	But when Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor’s decision, I ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar.”
ACT.25.22	Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man myself.”
ACT.25.22	He replied, “Tomorrow you will hear him.”
ACT.25.23	The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high-ranking military officers and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. 
ACT.25.24	Festus said: “King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. 
ACT.25.25	I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome. 
ACT.25.26	But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write. 
ACT.25.27	For I think it is unreasonable to send a prisoner on to Rome without specifying the charges against him.”
ACT.26.1	Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.”
ACT.26.1	So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense: 
ACT.26.2	“King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews, 
ACT.26.3	and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.
ACT.26.4	“The Jewish people all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem. 
ACT.26.5	They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee. 
ACT.26.6	And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our ancestors that I am on trial today. 
ACT.26.7	This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. King Agrippa, it is because of this hope that these Jews are accusing me. 
ACT.26.8	Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?
ACT.26.9	“I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
ACT.26.10	And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the Lord’s people in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them. 
ACT.26.11	Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. I was so obsessed with persecuting them that I even hunted them down in foreign cities.
ACT.26.12	“On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. 
ACT.26.13	About noon, King Agrippa, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions. 
ACT.26.14	We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic,
ACT.26.15	“Then I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’
ACT.26.15	“ 
ACT.26.19	“So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven. 
ACT.26.20	First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds. 
ACT.26.21	That is why some Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me. 
ACT.26.22	But God has helped me to this very day; so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen— 
ACT.26.23	that the Messiah would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would bring the message of light to his own people and to the Gentiles.”
ACT.26.24	At this point Festus interrupted Paul’s defense. “You are out of your mind, Paul!” he shouted. “Your great learning is driving you insane.”
ACT.26.25	“I am not insane, most excellent Festus,” Paul replied. “What I am saying is true and reasonable. 
ACT.26.26	The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner. 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”
ACT.26.28	Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?”
ACT.26.29	Paul replied, “Short time or long—I pray to God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains.”
ACT.26.30	The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them. 
ACT.26.31	After they left the room, they began saying to one another, “This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment.”
ACT.26.32	Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
ACT.27.1	When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment. 
ACT.27.2	We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.
ACT.27.3	The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs. 
ACT.27.4	From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us. 
ACT.27.5	When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia. 
ACT.27.6	There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board. 
ACT.27.7	We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. 
ACT.27.8	We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.
ACT.27.9	Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Day of Atonement.
ACT.27.10	“Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.” 
ACT.27.11	But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship. 
ACT.27.12	Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.
ACT.27.13	When a gentle south wind began to blow, they saw their opportunity; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete. 
ACT.27.14	Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the Northeaster, swept down from the island. 
ACT.27.15	The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along. 
ACT.27.16	As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure, 
ACT.27.17	so the men hoisted it aboard. Then they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Because they were afraid they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor
ACT.27.18	We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard. 
ACT.27.19	On the third day, they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands. 
ACT.27.20	When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.
ACT.27.21	After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: “Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss. 
ACT.27.22	But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed. 
ACT.27.23	Last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me 
ACT.27.24	and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me. 
ACT.27.26	Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.”
ACT.27.27	On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic
ACT.27.28	They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet
ACT.27.29	Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight. 
ACT.27.30	In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow. 
ACT.27.31	Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.” 
ACT.27.32	So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away.
ACT.27.33	Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. “For the last fourteen days,” he said, “you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food—you haven’t eaten anything. 
ACT.27.34	Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.” 
ACT.27.35	After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat. 
ACT.27.36	They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves. 
ACT.27.37	Altogether there were 276 of us on board. 
ACT.27.38	When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.
ACT.27.39	When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. 
ACT.27.40	Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. 
ACT.27.41	But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.
ACT.27.42	The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping. 
ACT.27.43	But the centurion wanted to spare Paul’s life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. 
ACT.27.44	The rest were to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land safely.
ACT.28.1	Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta. 
ACT.28.2	The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold. 
ACT.28.3	Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand. 
ACT.28.4	When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, “This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, the goddess Justice has not allowed him to live.” 
ACT.28.5	But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. 
ACT.28.6	The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
ACT.28.7	There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us to his home and showed us generous hospitality for three days. 
ACT.28.8	His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him. 
ACT.28.9	When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured. 
ACT.28.10	They honored us in many ways; and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.
ACT.28.11	After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island—it was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux. 
ACT.28.12	We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days. 
ACT.28.13	From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli. 
ACT.28.14	There we found some brothers and sisters who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome. 
ACT.28.15	The brothers and sisters there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these people Paul thanked God and was encouraged. 
ACT.28.16	When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him.
ACT.28.17	Three days later he called together the local Jewish leaders. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: “My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans. 
ACT.28.18	They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death. 
ACT.28.19	The Jews objected, so I was compelled to make an appeal to Caesar. I certainly did not intend to bring any charge against my own people. 
ACT.28.20	For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”
ACT.28.21	They replied, “We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of our people who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you. 
ACT.28.22	But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect.”
ACT.28.23	They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. He witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus. 
ACT.28.24	Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe. 
ACT.28.25	They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors when he said through Isaiah the prophet:
ACT.28.26	“ ‘Go to this people and say,
ACT.28.26	“You will be ever hearing but never understanding;
ACT.28.26	you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”
ACT.28.27	For this people’s heart has become calloused;
ACT.28.27	they hardly hear with their ears,
ACT.28.27	and they have closed their eyes.
ACT.28.27	Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
ACT.28.27	hear with their ears,
ACT.28.27	understand with their hearts
ACT.28.27	and turn, and I would heal them.’
ACT.28.28	“Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!” 
ACT.28.30	For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him. 
ACT.28.31	He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance!
ROM.1.1	Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God— 
ROM.1.2	the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures 
ROM.1.3	regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life
ROM.1.4	and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power
ROM.1.5	Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from
ROM.1.6	And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.7	To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people:
ROM.1.7	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world. 
ROM.1.9	God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you 
ROM.1.10	in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way may be opened for me to come to you.
ROM.1.11	I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong— 
ROM.1.12	that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith. 
ROM.1.13	I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters,
ROM.1.14	I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish. 
ROM.1.15	That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. 
ROM.1.17	For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last,
ROM.1.18	The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 
ROM.1.19	since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 
ROM.1.20	For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
ROM.1.21	For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 
ROM.1.22	Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 
ROM.1.23	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.
ROM.1.24	Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 
ROM.1.25	They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.
ROM.1.26	Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 
ROM.1.27	In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
ROM.1.28	Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. 
ROM.1.29	They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 
ROM.1.30	slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 
ROM.1.31	they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. 
ROM.1.32	Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
ROM.2.1	You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. 
ROM.2.2	Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. 
ROM.2.3	So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment? 
ROM.2.4	Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?
ROM.2.5	But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. 
ROM.2.6	God “will repay each person according to what they have done.”
ROM.2.7	To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. 
ROM.2.8	But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. 
ROM.2.9	There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; 
ROM.2.10	but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. 
ROM.2.11	For God does not show favoritism.
ROM.2.12	All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. 
ROM.2.13	For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. 
ROM.2.14	(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. 
ROM.2.15	They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) 
ROM.2.16	This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.
ROM.2.17	Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God; 
ROM.2.18	if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law; 
ROM.2.19	if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark, 
ROM.2.20	an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth— 
ROM.2.21	you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? 
ROM.2.22	You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 
ROM.2.23	You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? 
ROM.2.24	As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”
ROM.2.25	Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised. 
ROM.2.26	So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised? 
ROM.2.27	The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the
ROM.2.28	A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. 
ROM.2.29	No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person’s praise is not from other people, but from God.
ROM.3.1	What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision? 
ROM.3.2	Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God.
ROM.3.3	What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness? 
ROM.3.4	Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written:
ROM.3.4	“So that you may be proved right when you speak
ROM.3.4	and prevail when you judge.”
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.) 
ROM.3.6	Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world? 
ROM.3.7	Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?” 
ROM.3.8	Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is just!
ROM.3.9	What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin. 
ROM.3.10	As it is written:
ROM.3.10	“There is no one righteous, not even one;
ROM.3.11	there is no one who understands;
ROM.3.11	there is no one who seeks God.
ROM.3.12	All have turned away,
ROM.3.12	they have together become worthless;
ROM.3.12	there is no one who does good,
ROM.3.12	not even one.”
ROM.3.13	“Their throats are open graves;
ROM.3.13	their tongues practice deceit.”
ROM.3.13	“The poison of vipers is on their lips.”
ROM.3.14	“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”
ROM.3.15	“Their feet are swift to shed blood;
ROM.3.16	ruin and misery mark their ways,
ROM.3.17	and the way of peace they do not know.”
ROM.3.18	“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
ROM.3.19	Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. 
ROM.3.20	Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.
ROM.3.21	But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. 
ROM.3.22	This righteousness is given through faith in
ROM.3.23	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 
ROM.3.24	and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 
ROM.3.25	God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement,
ROM.3.26	he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
ROM.3.27	Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. 
ROM.3.28	For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 
ROM.3.29	Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, 
ROM.3.30	since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. 
ROM.3.31	Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.
ROM.4.1	What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter? 
ROM.4.2	If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God. 
ROM.4.3	What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”
ROM.4.4	Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. 
ROM.4.5	However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness. 
ROM.4.6	David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
ROM.4.7	“Blessed are those
ROM.4.7	whose transgressions are forgiven,
ROM.4.7	whose sins are covered.
ROM.4.8	Blessed is the one
ROM.4.8	whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”
ROM.4.9	Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness. 
ROM.4.10	Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before! 
ROM.4.11	And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them. 
ROM.4.12	And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
ROM.4.13	It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. 
ROM.4.14	For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless, 
ROM.4.15	because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.
ROM.4.16	Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all. 
ROM.4.17	As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.”
ROM.4.18	Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”
ROM.4.19	Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead. 
ROM.4.20	Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, 
ROM.4.21	being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. 
ROM.4.22	This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” 
ROM.4.23	The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone, 
ROM.4.24	but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. 
ROM.4.25	He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.
ROM.5.1	Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we
ROM.5.2	through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we
ROM.5.3	Not only so, but we
ROM.5.4	perseverance, character; and character, hope. 
ROM.5.5	And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.
ROM.5.6	You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. 
ROM.5.7	Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. 
ROM.5.8	But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
ROM.5.9	Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him! 
ROM.5.10	For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! 
ROM.5.11	Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
ROM.5.12	Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned—
ROM.5.13	To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone’s account where there is no law. 
ROM.5.14	Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who is a pattern of the one to come.
ROM.5.15	But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! 
ROM.5.16	Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man’s sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. 
ROM.5.17	For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!
ROM.5.18	Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. 
ROM.5.19	For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.
ROM.5.20	The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, 
ROM.5.21	so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 
ROM.6.2	By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 
ROM.6.3	Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 
ROM.6.4	We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
ROM.6.5	For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. 
ROM.6.6	For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with,
ROM.6.7	because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
ROM.6.8	Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 
ROM.6.9	For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. 
ROM.6.10	The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.
ROM.6.11	In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. 
ROM.6.12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. 
ROM.6.13	Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. 
ROM.6.14	For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.
ROM.6.15	What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means! 
ROM.6.16	Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? 
ROM.6.17	But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance. 
ROM.6.18	You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
ROM.6.19	I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness. 
ROM.6.20	When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. 
ROM.6.21	What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! 
ROM.6.22	But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life. 
ROM.6.23	For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in
ROM.7.1	Do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives? 
ROM.7.2	For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him. 
ROM.7.3	So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
ROM.7.4	So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. 
ROM.7.5	For when we were in the realm of the flesh,
ROM.7.6	But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.
ROM.7.7	What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”
ROM.7.8	But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead. 
ROM.7.9	Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. 
ROM.7.10	I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. 
ROM.7.11	For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. 
ROM.7.12	So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.
ROM.7.13	Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
ROM.7.14	We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 
ROM.7.15	I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 
ROM.7.16	And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 
ROM.7.17	As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 
ROM.7.18	For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature.
ROM.7.19	For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. 
ROM.7.20	Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
ROM.7.21	So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 
ROM.7.22	For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; 
ROM.7.23	but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. 
ROM.7.24	What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 
ROM.7.25	Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!
ROM.7.25	So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature
ROM.8.1	Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, 
ROM.8.2	because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you
ROM.8.3	For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh,
ROM.8.4	in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
ROM.8.5	Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. 
ROM.8.6	The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. 
ROM.8.7	The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so. 
ROM.8.8	Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.
ROM.8.9	You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ. 
ROM.8.10	But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life
ROM.8.11	And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of
ROM.8.12	Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation—but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it. 
ROM.8.13	For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.
ROM.8.14	For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. 
ROM.8.15	The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.
ROM.8.16	The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. 
ROM.8.17	Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.
ROM.8.18	I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. 
ROM.8.19	For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. 
ROM.8.20	For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope 
ROM.8.21	that
ROM.8.22	We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. 
ROM.8.23	Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies. 
ROM.8.24	For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have? 
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.
ROM.8.26	In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. 
ROM.8.27	And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.
ROM.8.28	And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who
ROM.8.29	For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. 
ROM.8.30	And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.
ROM.8.31	What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 
ROM.8.32	He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? 
ROM.8.33	Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. 
ROM.8.34	Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. 
ROM.8.35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? 
ROM.8.36	As it is written:
ROM.8.36	“For your sake we face death all day long;
ROM.8.36	we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”
ROM.8.37	No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 
ROM.8.38	For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,
ROM.8.39	neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit— 
ROM.9.2	I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 
ROM.9.3	For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race, 
ROM.9.4	the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises. 
ROM.9.5	Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised!
ROM.9.6	It is not as though God’s word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. 
ROM.9.7	Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”
ROM.9.8	In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring. 
ROM.9.9	For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”
ROM.9.10	Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac. 
ROM.9.11	Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand: 
ROM.9.12	not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”
ROM.9.13	Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
ROM.9.14	What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! 
ROM.9.15	For he says to Moses,
ROM.9.15	“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,
ROM.9.15	and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
ROM.9.16	It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy. 
ROM.9.17	For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”
ROM.9.18	Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
ROM.9.19	One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?” 
ROM.9.20	But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’ ”
ROM.9.21	Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?
ROM.9.22	What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction? 
ROM.9.23	What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory— 
ROM.9.24	even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 
ROM.9.25	As he says in Hosea:
ROM.9.25	“I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people;
ROM.9.25	and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one,”
ROM.9.26	and,
ROM.9.26	“In the very place where it was said to them,
ROM.9.26	‘You are not my people,’
ROM.9.26	there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’ ”
ROM.9.27	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel:
ROM.9.27	“Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea,
ROM.9.27	only the remnant will be saved.
ROM.9.28	For the Lord will carry out
ROM.9.28	his sentence on earth with speed and finality.”
ROM.9.29	It is just as Isaiah said previously:
ROM.9.29	“Unless the Lord Almighty
ROM.9.29	had left us descendants,
ROM.9.29	we would have become like Sodom,
ROM.9.29	we would have been like Gomorrah.”
ROM.9.30	What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; 
ROM.9.31	but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal. 
ROM.9.32	Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone. 
ROM.9.33	As it is written:
ROM.9.33	“See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble
ROM.9.33	and a rock that makes them fall,
ROM.9.33	and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame.”
ROM.10.1	Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. 
ROM.10.2	For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. 
ROM.10.3	Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. 
ROM.10.4	Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
ROM.10.5	Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”
ROM.10.6	But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ ”
ROM.10.7	“or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’ ”
ROM.10.8	But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,”
ROM.10.9	If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 
ROM.10.10	For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. 
ROM.10.11	As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.”
ROM.10.12	For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 
ROM.10.13	for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
ROM.10.14	How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? 
ROM.10.15	And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”
ROM.10.16	But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”
ROM.10.17	Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. 
ROM.10.18	But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did:
ROM.10.18	“Their voice has gone out into all the earth,
ROM.10.18	their words to the ends of the world.”
ROM.10.19	Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says,
ROM.10.19	“I will make you envious by those who are not a nation;
ROM.10.19	I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.”
ROM.10.20	And Isaiah boldly says,
ROM.10.20	“I was found by those who did not seek me;
ROM.10.20	I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.”
ROM.10.21	But concerning Israel he says,
ROM.10.21	“All day long I have held out my hands
ROM.10.21	to a disobedient and obstinate people.”
ROM.11.1	I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 
ROM.11.2	God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don’t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he appealed to God against Israel: 
ROM.11.3	“Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me”
ROM.11.4	And what was God’s answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
ROM.11.5	So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 
ROM.11.6	And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.
ROM.11.7	What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. The elect among them did, but the others were hardened, 
ROM.11.8	as it is written:
ROM.11.8	“God gave them a spirit of stupor,
ROM.11.8	eyes that could not see
ROM.11.8	and ears that could not hear,
ROM.11.8	to this very day.”
ROM.11.9	And David says:
ROM.11.9	“May their table become a snare and a trap,
ROM.11.9	a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
ROM.11.10	May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,
ROM.11.10	and their backs be bent forever.”
ROM.11.11	Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. 
ROM.11.12	But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring!
ROM.11.13	I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry 
ROM.11.14	in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. 
ROM.11.15	For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 
ROM.11.16	If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.
ROM.11.17	If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, 
ROM.11.18	do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. 
ROM.11.19	You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” 
ROM.11.20	Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. 
ROM.11.21	For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.
ROM.11.22	Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. 
ROM.11.23	And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 
ROM.11.24	After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!
ROM.11.25	I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, 
ROM.11.26	and in this way
ROM.11.26	“The deliverer will come from Zion;
ROM.11.26	he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.
ROM.11.27	And this is
ROM.11.27	when I take away their sins.”
ROM.11.28	As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, 
ROM.11.29	for God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable. 
ROM.11.30	Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, 
ROM.11.31	so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now
ROM.11.32	For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.
ROM.11.33	Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and
ROM.11.33	How unsearchable his judgments,
ROM.11.33	and his paths beyond tracing out!
ROM.11.34	“Who has known the mind of the Lord?
ROM.11.34	Or who has been his counselor?”
ROM.11.35	“Who has ever given to God,
ROM.11.35	that God should repay them?”
ROM.11.36	For from him and through him and for him are all things.
ROM.11.36	To him be the glory forever! Amen.
ROM.12.1	Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. 
ROM.12.2	Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
ROM.12.3	For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. 
ROM.12.4	For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, 
ROM.12.5	so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. 
ROM.12.6	We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your
ROM.12.7	if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; 
ROM.12.8	if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead,
ROM.12.9	Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 
ROM.12.10	Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. 
ROM.12.11	Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 
ROM.12.12	Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 
ROM.12.13	Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.
ROM.12.14	Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. 
ROM.12.16	Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position.
ROM.12.17	Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. 
ROM.12.18	If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 
ROM.12.19	Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”
ROM.12.20	On the contrary:
ROM.12.20	“If your enemy is hungry, feed him;
ROM.12.20	if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.
ROM.12.20	In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.”
ROM.12.21	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
ROM.13.1	Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 
ROM.13.2	Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 
ROM.13.3	For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 
ROM.13.4	For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 
ROM.13.5	Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.
ROM.13.6	This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. 
ROM.13.7	Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.
ROM.13.8	Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. 
ROM.13.9	The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,”
ROM.13.10	Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
ROM.13.11	And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. 
ROM.13.12	The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. 
ROM.13.13	Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. 
ROM.13.14	Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.
ROM.14.1	Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters. 
ROM.14.2	One person’s faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. 
ROM.14.3	The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them. 
ROM.14.4	Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.
ROM.14.5	One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind. 
ROM.14.6	Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. 
ROM.14.7	For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. 
ROM.14.8	If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. 
ROM.14.9	For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.
ROM.14.10	You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister
ROM.14.11	It is written:
ROM.14.11	“ ‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord,
ROM.14.11	‘every knee will bow before me;
ROM.14.11	every tongue will acknowledge God.’ ”
ROM.14.12	So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
ROM.14.13	Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister. 
ROM.14.14	I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean. 
ROM.14.15	If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died. 
ROM.14.16	Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil. 
ROM.14.17	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, 
ROM.14.18	because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval.
ROM.14.19	Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. 
ROM.14.20	Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. 
ROM.14.21	It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall.
ROM.14.22	So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves. 
ROM.14.23	But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
ROM.15.1	We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. 
ROM.15.2	Each of us should please our neighbors for their good, to build them up. 
ROM.15.3	For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”
ROM.15.4	For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope.
ROM.15.5	May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had, 
ROM.15.6	so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.15.7	Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God. 
ROM.15.8	For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews
ROM.15.9	and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written:
ROM.15.9	“Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles;
ROM.15.9	I will sing the praises of your name.”
ROM.15.10	Again, it says,
ROM.15.10	“Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.”
ROM.15.11	And again,
ROM.15.11	“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles;
ROM.15.11	let all the peoples extol him.”
ROM.15.12	And again, Isaiah says,
ROM.15.12	“The Root of Jesse will spring up,
ROM.15.12	one who will arise to rule over the nations;
ROM.15.12	in him the Gentiles will hope.”
ROM.15.13	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
ROM.15.14	I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another. 
ROM.15.15	Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me 
ROM.15.16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
ROM.15.17	Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God. 
ROM.15.18	I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done— 
ROM.15.19	by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ. 
ROM.15.20	It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation. 
ROM.15.21	Rather, as it is written:
ROM.15.21	“Those who were not told about him will see,
ROM.15.21	and those who have not heard will understand.”
ROM.15.22	This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
ROM.15.23	But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to visit you, 
ROM.15.24	I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while. 
ROM.15.25	Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord’s people there. 
ROM.15.26	For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord’s people in Jerusalem. 
ROM.15.27	They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings. 
ROM.15.28	So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way. 
ROM.15.29	I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.
ROM.15.30	I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me. 
ROM.15.31	Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the Lord’s people there, 
ROM.15.32	so that I may come to you with joy, by God’s will, and in your company be refreshed. 
ROM.15.33	The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.1	I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon
ROM.16.2	I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of his people and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been the benefactor of many people, including me.
ROM.16.3	Greet Priscilla
ROM.16.4	They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.
ROM.16.5	Greet also the church that meets at their house.
ROM.16.5	Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.
ROM.16.6	Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.
ROM.16.7	Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among
ROM.16.8	Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord.
ROM.16.9	Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
ROM.16.10	Greet Apelles, whose fidelity to Christ has stood the test.
ROM.16.10	Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
ROM.16.11	Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew.
ROM.16.11	Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
ROM.16.12	Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord.
ROM.16.12	Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.
ROM.16.13	Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.
ROM.16.14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the other brothers and sisters with them.
ROM.16.15	Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the Lord’s people who are with them.
ROM.16.16	Greet one another with a holy kiss.
ROM.16.16	All the churches of Christ send greetings.
ROM.16.17	I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. 
ROM.16.18	For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people. 
ROM.16.19	Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice because of you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.
ROM.16.20	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.
ROM.16.20	The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
ROM.16.21	Timothy, my co-worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, my fellow Jews.
ROM.16.22	I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.
ROM.16.23	Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings.
ROM.16.23	Erastus, who is the city’s director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings. 
ROM.16.25	Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel, the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ, in keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past, 
ROM.16.26	but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from
ROM.16.27	to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.
1CO.1.1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,
1CO.1.2	To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:
1CO.1.3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.1.4	I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus. 
1CO.1.5	For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge— 
1CO.1.6	God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you. 
1CO.1.7	Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. 
1CO.1.8	He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1CO.1.9	God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
1CO.1.10	I appeal to you, brothers and sisters,
1CO.1.11	My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you. 
1CO.1.12	What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas
1CO.1.13	Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul? 
1CO.1.14	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 
1CO.1.15	so no one can say that you were baptized in my name. 
1CO.1.16	(Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.) 
1CO.1.17	For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
1CO.1.18	For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
1CO.1.19	For it is written:
1CO.1.19	“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;
1CO.1.19	the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”
1CO.1.20	Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 
1CO.1.21	For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 
1CO.1.22	Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 
1CO.1.23	but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 
1CO.1.24	but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
1CO.1.25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.
1CO.1.26	Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 
1CO.1.27	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 
1CO.1.28	God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are, 
1CO.1.29	so that no one may boast before him. 
1CO.1.30	It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 
1CO.1.31	Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”
1CO.2.1	And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.
1CO.2.2	For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 
1CO.2.3	I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling. 
1CO.2.4	My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power, 
1CO.2.5	so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power.
1CO.2.6	We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 
1CO.2.7	No, we declare God’s wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. 
1CO.2.8	None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
1CO.2.9	However, as it is written:
1CO.2.9	“What no eye has seen,
1CO.2.9	what no ear has heard,
1CO.2.9	and what no human mind has conceived”
1CO.2.9	the things God has prepared for those who love him—
1CO.2.10	these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.
1CO.2.10	The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 
1CO.2.11	For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 
1CO.2.12	What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. 
1CO.2.13	This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.
1CO.2.14	The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. 
1CO.2.15	The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, 
1CO.2.16	for,
1CO.2.16	“Who has known the mind of the Lord
1CO.2.16	so as to instruct him?”
1CO.2.16	But we have the mind of Christ.
1CO.3.1	Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly—mere infants in Christ. 
1CO.3.2	I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. 
1CO.3.3	You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans? 
1CO.3.4	For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere human beings?
1CO.3.5	What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task. 
1CO.3.6	I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. 
1CO.3.7	So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. 
1CO.3.8	The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. 
1CO.3.9	For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.
1CO.3.10	By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. 
1CO.3.11	For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
1CO.3.12	If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, 
1CO.3.13	their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work. 
1CO.3.14	If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames.
1CO.3.16	Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst? 
1CO.3.17	If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.
1CO.3.18	Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise. 
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”
1CO.3.20	and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”
1CO.3.21	So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, 
1CO.3.22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas
1CO.3.23	and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.
1CO.4.1	This, then, is how you ought to regard us: as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the mysteries God has revealed. 
1CO.4.2	Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful. 
1CO.4.3	I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself. 
1CO.4.4	My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. 
1CO.4.5	Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God.
1CO.4.6	Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, “Do not go beyond what is written.” Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other. 
1CO.4.7	For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?
1CO.4.8	Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have begun to reign—and that without us! How I wish that you really had begun to reign so that we also might reign with you! 
1CO.4.9	For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like those condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to human beings. 
1CO.4.10	We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored! 
1CO.4.11	To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless. 
1CO.4.12	We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it; 
1CO.4.13	when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the garbage of the world—right up to this moment.
1CO.4.14	I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children. 
1CO.4.15	Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel. 
1CO.4.16	Therefore I urge you to imitate me. 
1CO.4.17	For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church.
1CO.4.18	Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have. 
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power. 
1CO.4.21	What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline, or shall I come in love and with a gentle spirit?
1CO.5.1	It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate: A man is sleeping with his father’s wife. 
1CO.5.2	And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this? 
1CO.5.3	For my part, even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. As one who is present with you in this way, I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this. 
1CO.5.4	So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, 
1CO.5.5	hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,
1CO.5.6	Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough? 
1CO.5.7	Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
1CO.5.8	Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1CO.5.9	I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— 
1CO.5.10	not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. 
1CO.5.11	But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister
1CO.5.12	What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? 
1CO.5.13	God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked person from among you.”
1CO.6.1	If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord’s people? 
1CO.6.2	Or do you not know that the Lord’s people will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? 
1CO.6.3	Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life! 
1CO.6.4	Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church? 
1CO.6.5	I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers? 
1CO.6.6	But instead, one brother takes another to court—and this in front of unbelievers!
1CO.6.7	The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? 
1CO.6.8	Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters. 
1CO.6.9	Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men
1CO.6.10	nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 
1CO.6.11	And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.12	“I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but I will not be mastered by anything. 
1CO.6.13	You say, “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.” The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 
1CO.6.14	By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also. 
1CO.6.15	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! 
1CO.6.16	Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.”
1CO.6.17	But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.
1CO.6.18	Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. 
1CO.6.19	Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; 
1CO.6.20	you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.
1CO.7.1	Now for the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” 
1CO.7.2	But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband. 
1CO.7.3	The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. 
1CO.7.4	The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. 
1CO.7.5	Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 
1CO.7.6	I say this as a concession, not as a command. 
1CO.7.7	I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.
1CO.7.8	Now to the unmarried
1CO.7.9	But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
1CO.7.10	To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. 
1CO.7.11	But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.
1CO.7.12	To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. 
1CO.7.13	And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
1CO.7.15	But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. 
1CO.7.16	How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
1CO.7.17	Nevertheless, each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. 
1CO.7.18	Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. 
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commands is what counts. 
1CO.7.20	Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.
1CO.7.21	Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it trouble you—although if you can gain your freedom, do so. 
1CO.7.22	For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord’s freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ’s slave. 
1CO.7.23	You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings. 
1CO.7.24	Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.
1CO.7.25	Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. 
1CO.7.26	Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is. 
1CO.7.27	Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife. 
1CO.7.28	But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.
1CO.7.29	What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not; 
1CO.7.30	those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; 
1CO.7.31	those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.
1CO.7.32	I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord. 
1CO.7.33	But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife— 
1CO.7.34	and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord’s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband. 
1CO.7.35	I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.
1CO.7.36	If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong
1CO.7.37	But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing. 
1CO.7.38	So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.
1CO.7.39	A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. 
1CO.7.40	In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.
1CO.8.1	Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that “We all possess knowledge.” But knowledge puffs up while love builds up. 
1CO.8.2	Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know. 
1CO.8.3	But whoever loves God is known by God.
1CO.8.4	So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that “An idol is nothing at all in the world” and that “There is no God but one.” 
1CO.8.5	For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”), 
1CO.8.6	yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.
1CO.8.7	But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. 
1CO.8.8	But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.
1CO.8.9	Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak. 
1CO.8.10	For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol’s temple, won’t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols? 
1CO.8.11	So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. 
1CO.8.12	When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 
1CO.8.13	Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.
1CO.9.1	Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord? 
1CO.9.2	Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
1CO.9.3	This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. 
1CO.9.4	Don’t we have the right to food and drink? 
1CO.9.5	Don’t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas
1CO.9.6	Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living?
1CO.9.7	Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk? 
1CO.9.8	Do I say this merely on human authority? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing? 
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.”
1CO.9.10	Surely he says this for us, doesn’t he? Yes, this was written for us, because whoever plows and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest. 
1CO.9.11	If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you? 
1CO.9.12	If others have this right of support from you, shouldn’t we have it all the more?
1CO.9.12	But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.
1CO.9.13	Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar? 
1CO.9.14	In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.
1CO.9.15	But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me, for I would rather die than allow anyone to deprive me of this boast. 
1CO.9.16	For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! 
1CO.9.17	If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me. 
1CO.9.18	What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel.
1CO.9.19	Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. 
1CO.9.20	To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. 
1CO.9.21	To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those not having the law. 
1CO.9.22	To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. 
1CO.9.23	I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.
1CO.9.24	Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. 
1CO.9.25	Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. 
1CO.9.26	Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air. 
1CO.9.27	No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.
1CO.10.1	For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. 
1CO.10.2	They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. 
1CO.10.3	They all ate the same spiritual food 
1CO.10.4	and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. 
1CO.10.5	Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.
1CO.10.6	Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. 
1CO.10.7	Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.”
1CO.10.8	We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died. 
1CO.10.9	We should not test Christ,
1CO.10.10	And do not grumble, as some of them did—and were killed by the destroying angel.
1CO.10.11	These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come. 
1CO.10.12	So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall! 
1CO.10.13	No temptation
1CO.10.14	Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. 
1CO.10.15	I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. 
1CO.10.16	Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? 
1CO.10.17	Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf.
1CO.10.18	Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar? 
1CO.10.19	Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
1CO.10.20	No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. 
1CO.10.21	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons. 
1CO.10.22	Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
1CO.10.23	“I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but not everything is constructive. 
1CO.10.24	No one should seek their own good, but the good of others.
1CO.10.25	Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, 
1CO.10.26	for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”
1CO.10.27	If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. 
1CO.10.28	But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience. 
1CO.10.29	I am referring to the other person’s conscience, not yours. For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience? 
1CO.10.30	If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?
1CO.10.31	So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God— 
1CO.10.33	even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.
1CO.11.1	Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.
1CO.11.2	I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you. 
1CO.11.3	But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man,
1CO.11.4	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 
1CO.11.5	But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved. 
1CO.11.6	For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.
1CO.11.7	A man ought not to cover his head,
1CO.11.8	For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; 
1CO.11.9	neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 
1CO.11.10	It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own
1CO.11.11	Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 
1CO.11.12	For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.
1CO.11.13	Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
1CO.11.14	Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 
1CO.11.15	but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. 
1CO.11.16	If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God.
1CO.11.17	In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. 
1CO.11.18	In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 
1CO.11.19	No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval. 
1CO.11.20	So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat, 
1CO.11.21	for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. 
1CO.11.22	Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!
1CO.11.23	For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 
1CO.11.24	and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 
1CO.11.25	In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, 
1CO.11.26	For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.
1CO.11.27	So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 
1CO.11.28	Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. 
1CO.11.29	For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves. 
1CO.11.30	That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 
1CO.11.31	But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment. 
1CO.11.32	Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.
1CO.11.33	So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together. 
1CO.11.34	Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.
1CO.11.34	And when I come I will give further directions.
1CO.12.1	Now about the gifts of the Spirit, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. 
1CO.12.2	You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols. 
1CO.12.3	Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.4	There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. 
1CO.12.5	There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. 
1CO.12.6	There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work.
1CO.12.7	Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. 
1CO.12.8	To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, 
1CO.12.9	to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, 
1CO.12.10	to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues,
1CO.12.11	All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.
1CO.12.12	Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. 
1CO.12.13	For we were all baptized by
1CO.12.14	Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.
1CO.12.15	Now if the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 
1CO.12.18	But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. 
1CO.12.19	If they were all one part, where would the body be? 
1CO.12.20	As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
1CO.12.21	The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!” 
1CO.12.22	On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 
1CO.12.23	and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, 
1CO.12.24	while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, 
1CO.12.25	so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. 
1CO.12.26	If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
1CO.12.27	Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. 
1CO.12.28	And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues. 
1CO.12.29	Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 
1CO.12.30	Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues
1CO.12.31	Now eagerly desire the greater gifts.
1CO.12.31	And yet I will show you the most excellent way.
1CO.13.1	If I speak in the tongues
1CO.13.2	If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 
1CO.13.3	If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,
1CO.13.4	Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
1CO.13.5	It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 
1CO.13.6	Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
1CO.13.7	It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
1CO.13.8	Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
1CO.13.9	For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
1CO.13.10	but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 
1CO.13.12	For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
1CO.13.13	And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
1CO.14.1	Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy. 
1CO.14.2	For anyone who speaks in a tongue
1CO.14.3	But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort. 
1CO.14.4	Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. 
1CO.14.5	I would like every one of you to speak in tongues,
1CO.14.6	Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? 
1CO.14.7	Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? 
1CO.14.8	Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? 
1CO.14.9	So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. 
1CO.14.10	Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. 
1CO.14.11	If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. 
1CO.14.12	So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.
1CO.14.13	For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say. 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 
1CO.14.15	So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding. 
1CO.14.16	Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer,
1CO.14.17	You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.
1CO.14.18	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 
1CO.14.19	But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1CO.14.20	Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. 
1CO.14.21	In the Law it is written:
1CO.14.21	“With other tongues
1CO.14.21	and through the lips of foreigners
1CO.14.21	I will speak to this people,
1CO.14.21	but even then they will not listen to me,
1CO.14.21	says the Lord.”
1CO.14.22	Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. 
1CO.14.23	So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? 
1CO.14.24	But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all, 
1CO.14.25	as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, “God is really among you!”
1CO.14.26	What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up. 
1CO.14.27	If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. 
1CO.14.28	If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God.
1CO.14.29	Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. 
1CO.14.30	And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. 
1CO.14.31	For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. 
1CO.14.32	The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. 
1CO.14.33	For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all the congregations of the Lord’s people.
1CO.14.34	Women
1CO.14.35	If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
1CO.14.36	Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? 
1CO.14.37	If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command. 
1CO.14.38	But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored.
1CO.14.39	Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. 
1CO.14.40	But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
1CO.15.1	Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. 
1CO.15.2	By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.
1CO.15.3	For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance
1CO.15.4	that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 
1CO.15.5	and that he appeared to Cephas,
1CO.15.6	After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 
1CO.15.7	Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 
1CO.15.8	and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.
1CO.15.9	For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. 
1CO.15.11	Whether, then, it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.
1CO.15.12	But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
1CO.15.13	If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 
1CO.15.14	And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. 
1CO.15.15	More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. 
1CO.15.16	For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. 
1CO.15.17	And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. 
1CO.15.18	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. 
1CO.15.19	If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.
1CO.15.20	But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 
1CO.15.21	For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. 
1CO.15.22	For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. 
1CO.15.23	But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. 
1CO.15.24	Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. 
1CO.15.25	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 
1CO.15.26	The last enemy to be destroyed is death. 
1CO.15.27	For he “has put everything under his feet.”
1CO.15.28	When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.
1CO.15.29	Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? 
1CO.15.30	And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? 
1CO.15.31	I face death every day—yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
1CO.15.32	If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised,
1CO.15.32	“Let us eat and drink,
1CO.15.32	for tomorrow we die.”
1CO.15.33	Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.”
1CO.15.34	Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame.
1CO.15.35	But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?” 
1CO.15.36	How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 
1CO.15.37	When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. 
1CO.15.38	But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. 
1CO.15.39	Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. 
1CO.15.40	There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. 
1CO.15.41	The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.
1CO.15.42	So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; 
1CO.15.43	it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 
1CO.15.44	it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.
1CO.15.44	If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 
1CO.15.45	So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being”
1CO.15.46	The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven. 
1CO.15.48	As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven. 
1CO.15.49	And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we
1CO.15.50	I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 
1CO.15.51	Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed— 
1CO.15.52	in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 
1CO.15.53	For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. 
1CO.15.54	When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”
1CO.15.55	“Where, O death, is your victory?
1CO.15.55	Where, O death, is your sting?”
1CO.15.56	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 
1CO.15.57	But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
1CO.16.1	Now about the collection for the Lord’s people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do. 
1CO.16.2	On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made. 
1CO.16.3	Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem. 
1CO.16.4	If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me.
1CO.16.5	After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you—for I will be going through Macedonia. 
1CO.16.6	Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go. 
1CO.16.7	For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. 
1CO.16.8	But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost, 
1CO.16.9	because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.
1CO.16.10	When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am. 
1CO.16.11	No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers.
1CO.16.12	Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.
1CO.16.13	Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong. 
1CO.16.14	Do everything in love.
1CO.16.15	You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord’s people. I urge you, brothers and sisters, 
1CO.16.16	to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it. 
1CO.16.17	I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you. 
1CO.16.18	For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.
1CO.16.19	The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla
1CO.16.20	All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1CO.16.21	I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand.
1CO.16.22	If anyone does not love the Lord, let that person be cursed! Come, Lord
1CO.16.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
1CO.16.24	My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2CO.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
2CO.1.1	To the church of God in Corinth, together with all his holy people throughout Achaia:
2CO.1.2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2CO.1.3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, 
2CO.1.4	who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God. 
2CO.1.5	For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ. 
2CO.1.6	If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer. 
2CO.1.7	And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.
2CO.1.8	We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters,
2CO.1.9	Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead. 
2CO.1.10	He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us, 
2CO.1.11	as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.
2CO.1.12	Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, with integrity
2CO.1.13	For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that, 
2CO.1.14	as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.
2CO.1.15	Because I was confident of this, I wanted to visit you first so that you might benefit twice. 
2CO.1.16	I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea. 
2CO.1.17	Was I fickle when I intended to do this? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say both “Yes, yes” and “No, no”?
2CO.1.18	But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.” 
2CO.1.19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silas
2CO.1.20	For no matter how many promises God has made, they are “Yes” in Christ. And so through him the “Amen” is spoken by us to the glory of God. 
2CO.1.21	Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, 
2CO.1.22	set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
2CO.1.23	I call God as my witness—and I stake my life on it—that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth. 
2CO.1.24	Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.
2CO.2.1	So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you. 
2CO.2.2	For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved? 
2CO.2.3	I wrote as I did, so that when I came I would not be distressed by those who should have made me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy. 
2CO.2.4	For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.
2CO.2.5	If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent—not to put it too severely. 
2CO.2.6	The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient. 
2CO.2.7	Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 
2CO.2.8	I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. 
2CO.2.9	Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. 
2CO.2.10	Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, 
2CO.2.11	in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
2CO.2.12	Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me, 
2CO.2.13	I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.
2CO.2.14	But thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ’s triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere. 
2CO.2.15	For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. 
2CO.2.16	To the one we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life. And who is equal to such a task? 
2CO.2.17	Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.
2CO.3.1	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you? 
2CO.3.2	You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone. 
2CO.3.3	You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
2CO.3.4	Such confidence we have through Christ before God. 
2CO.3.5	Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God. 
2CO.3.6	He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
2CO.3.7	Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, transitory though it was, 
2CO.3.8	will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? 
2CO.3.9	If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness! 
2CO.3.10	For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory. 
2CO.3.11	And if what was transitory came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!
2CO.3.12	Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold. 
2CO.3.13	We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away. 
2CO.3.14	But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. 
2CO.3.15	Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. 
2CO.3.16	But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 
2CO.3.17	Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 
2CO.3.18	And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate
2CO.4.1	Therefore, since through God’s mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart. 
2CO.4.2	Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God. 
2CO.4.3	And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. 
2CO.4.4	The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 
2CO.4.5	For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake. 
2CO.4.6	For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,”
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. 
2CO.4.8	We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; 
2CO.4.9	persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. 
2CO.4.10	We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. 
2CO.4.11	For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body. 
2CO.4.12	So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
2CO.4.13	It is written: “I believed; therefore I have spoken.”
2CO.4.14	because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you to himself. 
2CO.4.15	All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.
2CO.4.16	Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. 
2CO.4.17	For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. 
2CO.4.18	So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
2CO.5.1	For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands. 
2CO.5.2	Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, 
2CO.5.3	because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked. 
2CO.5.4	For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. 
2CO.5.5	Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
2CO.5.6	Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. 
2CO.5.7	For we live by faith, not by sight. 
2CO.5.8	We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord. 
2CO.5.9	So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it. 
2CO.5.10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.
2CO.5.11	Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience. 
2CO.5.12	We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart. 
2CO.5.13	If we are “out of our mind,” as some say, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. 
2CO.5.14	For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. 
2CO.5.15	And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.
2CO.5.16	So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. 
2CO.5.17	Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come:
2CO.5.18	All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 
2CO.5.19	that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. 
2CO.5.20	We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. 
2CO.5.21	God made him who had no sin to be sin
2CO.6.1	As God’s co-workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. 
2CO.6.2	For he says,
2CO.6.2	“In the time of my favor I heard you,
2CO.6.2	and in the day of salvation I helped you.”
2CO.6.2	I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation.
2CO.6.3	We put no stumbling block in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited. 
2CO.6.4	Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses; 
2CO.6.5	in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger; 
2CO.6.6	in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; 
2CO.6.7	in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; 
2CO.6.8	through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors; 
2CO.6.9	known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed; 
2CO.6.10	sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.
2CO.6.11	We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you. 
2CO.6.12	We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us. 
2CO.6.13	As a fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open wide your hearts also.
2CO.6.14	Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	What harmony is there between Christ and Belial
2CO.6.16	What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said:
2CO.6.16	“I will live with them
2CO.6.16	and walk among them,
2CO.6.16	and I will be their God,
2CO.6.16	and they will be my people.”
2CO.6.17	Therefore,
2CO.6.17	“Come out from them
2CO.6.17	and be separate,
2CO.6.17	says the Lord.
2CO.6.17	Touch no unclean thing,
2CO.6.17	and I will receive you.”
2CO.6.18	And,
2CO.6.18	“I will be a Father to you,
2CO.6.18	and you will be my sons and daughters,
2CO.6.18	says the Lord Almighty.”
2CO.7.1	Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.
2CO.7.2	Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one. 
2CO.7.3	I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you. 
2CO.7.4	I have spoken to you with great frankness; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.
2CO.7.5	For when we came into Macedonia, we had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn—conflicts on the outside, fears within. 
2CO.7.6	But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, 
2CO.7.7	and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.
2CO.7.8	Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it—I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while— 
2CO.7.9	yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us. 
2CO.7.10	Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. 
2CO.7.11	See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter. 
2CO.7.12	So even though I wrote to you, it was neither on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are. 
2CO.7.13	By all this we are encouraged.
2CO.7.13	In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you. 
2CO.7.14	I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well. 
2CO.7.15	And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling. 
2CO.7.16	I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.
2CO.8.1	And now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches. 
2CO.8.2	In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity. 
2CO.8.3	For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own, 
2CO.8.4	they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord’s people. 
2CO.8.5	And they exceeded our expectations: They gave themselves first of all to the Lord, and then by the will of God also to us. 
2CO.8.6	So we urged Titus, just as he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part. 
2CO.8.7	But since you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you
2CO.8.8	I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. 
2CO.8.9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.
2CO.8.10	And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter. Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so. 
2CO.8.11	Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means. 
2CO.8.12	For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.
2CO.8.13	Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality. 
2CO.8.14	At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality, 
2CO.8.15	as it is written: “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”
2CO.8.16	Thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you. 
2CO.8.17	For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative. 
2CO.8.18	And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel. 
2CO.8.19	What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help. 
2CO.8.20	We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift. 
2CO.8.21	For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man.
2CO.8.22	In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you. 
2CO.8.23	As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ. 
2CO.8.24	Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.
2CO.9.1	There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the Lord’s people. 
2CO.9.2	For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action. 
2CO.9.3	But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be. 
2CO.9.4	For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to say anything about you—would be ashamed of having been so confident. 
2CO.9.5	So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given.
2CO.9.6	Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. 
2CO.9.7	Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 
2CO.9.8	And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. 
2CO.9.9	As it is written:
2CO.9.9	“They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor;
2CO.9.9	their righteousness endures forever.”
2CO.9.10	Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. 
2CO.9.11	You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
2CO.9.12	This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord’s people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God. 
2CO.9.13	Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, others will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else. 
2CO.9.14	And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you. 
2CO.9.15	Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
2CO.10.1	By the humility and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul, who am “timid” when face to face with you, but “bold” toward you when away! 
2CO.10.2	I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world. 
2CO.10.3	For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. 
2CO.10.4	The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. 
2CO.10.5	We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. 
2CO.10.6	And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete.
2CO.10.7	You are judging by appearances.
2CO.10.8	So even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of it. 
2CO.10.9	I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters. 
2CO.10.10	For some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing.” 
2CO.10.11	Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.
2CO.10.12	We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise. 
2CO.10.13	We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us, a sphere that also includes you. 
2CO.10.14	We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ. 
2CO.10.15	Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand, 
2CO.10.16	so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work already done in someone else’s territory. 
2CO.10.17	But, “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”
2CO.10.18	For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
2CO.11.1	I hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness. Yes, please put up with me! 
2CO.11.2	I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. 
2CO.11.3	But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 
2CO.11.4	For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.
2CO.11.5	I do not think I am in the least inferior to those “super-apostles.”
2CO.11.6	I may indeed be untrained as a speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way. 
2CO.11.7	Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge? 
2CO.11.8	I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you. 
2CO.11.9	And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. 
2CO.11.10	As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine. 
2CO.11.11	Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
2CO.11.12	And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. 
2CO.11.13	For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 
2CO.11.14	And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.
2CO.11.16	I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then tolerate me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting. 
2CO.11.17	In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool. 
2CO.11.18	Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast. 
2CO.11.19	You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! 
2CO.11.20	In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face. 
2CO.11.21	To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that!
2CO.11.21	Whatever anyone else dares to boast about—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast about. 
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham’s descendants? So am I. 
2CO.11.23	Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. 
2CO.11.24	Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. 
2CO.11.25	Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, 
2CO.11.26	I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers. 
2CO.11.27	I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. 
2CO.11.28	Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. 
2CO.11.29	Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?
2CO.11.30	If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. 
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying. 
2CO.11.32	In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. 
2CO.11.33	But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.
2CO.12.1	I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows. 
2CO.12.3	And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows— 
2CO.12.4	was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell. 
2CO.12.5	I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses. 
2CO.12.6	Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say, 
2CO.12.7	or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. 
2CO.12.8	Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. 
2CO.12.9	But he said to me, 
2CO.12.10	That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
2CO.12.11	I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the “super-apostles,”
2CO.12.12	I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders and miracles. 
2CO.12.13	How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!
2CO.12.14	Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. 
2CO.12.15	So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less? 
2CO.12.16	Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery! 
2CO.12.17	Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to you? 
2CO.12.18	I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit?
2CO.12.19	Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening. 
2CO.12.20	For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder. 
2CO.12.21	I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.
2CO.13.1	This will be my third visit to you. “Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.”
2CO.13.2	I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others, 
2CO.13.3	since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you. 
2CO.13.4	For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God’s power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God’s power we will live with him in our dealing with you.
2CO.13.5	Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test? 
2CO.13.6	And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test. 
2CO.13.7	Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not so that people will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed. 
2CO.13.8	For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth. 
2CO.13.9	We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is that you may be fully restored. 
2CO.13.10	This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority—the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.
2CO.13.11	Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Strive for full restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
2CO.13.13	All God’s people here send their greetings.
2CO.13.14	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
GAL.1.1	Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— 
GAL.1.2	and all the brothers and sisters
GAL.1.2	To the churches in Galatia:
GAL.1.3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 
GAL.1.4	who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 
GAL.1.5	to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
GAL.1.6	I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— 
GAL.1.7	which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. 
GAL.1.8	But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! 
GAL.1.9	As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!
GAL.1.10	Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.
GAL.1.11	I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. 
GAL.1.12	I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.
GAL.1.13	For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. 
GAL.1.14	I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 
GAL.1.15	But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased 
GAL.1.16	to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being. 
GAL.1.17	I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.
GAL.1.18	Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas
GAL.1.19	I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother. 
GAL.1.20	I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.
GAL.1.21	Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. 
GAL.1.23	They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” 
GAL.1.24	And they praised God because of me.
GAL.2.1	Then after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also. 
GAL.2.2	I went in response to a revelation and, meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders, I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain. 
GAL.2.3	Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. 
GAL.2.4	This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves. 
GAL.2.5	We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.
GAL.2.6	As for those who were held in high esteem—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—they added nothing to my message. 
GAL.2.7	On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised,
GAL.2.8	For God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised, was also at work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles. 
GAL.2.9	James, Cephas
GAL.2.10	All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along.
GAL.2.11	When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. 
GAL.2.12	For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. 
GAL.2.13	The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.
GAL.2.14	When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?
GAL.2.15	“We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles 
GAL.2.16	know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in
GAL.2.17	“But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn’t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! 
GAL.2.18	If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.
GAL.2.19	“For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. 
GAL.2.20	I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 
GAL.2.21	I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!”
GAL.3.1	You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. 
GAL.3.2	I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard? 
GAL.3.3	Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?
GAL.3.4	Have you experienced
GAL.3.5	So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? 
GAL.3.6	So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”
GAL.3.7	Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham. 
GAL.3.8	Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”
GAL.3.9	So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
GAL.3.10	For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”
GAL.3.11	Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.”
GAL.3.12	The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does these things will live by them.”
GAL.3.13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.”
GAL.3.14	He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.
GAL.3.15	Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case. 
GAL.3.16	The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,”
GAL.3.17	What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise. 
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.
GAL.3.19	Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator. 
GAL.3.20	A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one.
GAL.3.21	Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. 
GAL.3.22	But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.
GAL.3.23	Before the coming of this faith,
GAL.3.24	So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. 
GAL.3.25	Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
GAL.3.26	So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, 
GAL.3.27	for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 
GAL.3.28	There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.29	If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
GAL.4.1	What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. 
GAL.4.2	The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. 
GAL.4.3	So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces
GAL.4.4	But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 
GAL.4.5	to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.
GAL.4.6	Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, “
GAL.4.7	So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir.
GAL.4.8	Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. 
GAL.4.9	But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces
GAL.4.10	You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! 
GAL.4.11	I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.
GAL.4.12	I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong. 
GAL.4.13	As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you, 
GAL.4.14	and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. 
GAL.4.15	Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. 
GAL.4.16	Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
GAL.4.17	Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them. 
GAL.4.18	It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you. 
GAL.4.19	My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, 
GAL.4.20	how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!
GAL.4.21	Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? 
GAL.4.22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. 
GAL.4.23	His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise.
GAL.4.24	These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. 
GAL.4.25	Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. 
GAL.4.26	But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	For it is written:
GAL.4.27	“Be glad, barren woman,
GAL.4.27	you who never bore a child;
GAL.4.27	shout for joy and cry aloud,
GAL.4.27	you who were never in labor;
GAL.4.27	because more are the children of the desolate woman
GAL.4.27	than of her who has a husband.”
GAL.4.28	Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise. 
GAL.4.29	At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. 
GAL.4.30	But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”
GAL.4.31	Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
GAL.5.1	It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
GAL.5.2	Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. 
GAL.5.3	Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. 
GAL.5.4	You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. 
GAL.5.5	For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope. 
GAL.5.6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.
GAL.5.7	You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth? 
GAL.5.8	That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. 
GAL.5.9	“A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.” 
GAL.5.10	I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty. 
GAL.5.11	Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. 
GAL.5.12	As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!
GAL.5.13	You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh
GAL.5.14	For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”
GAL.5.15	If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.
GAL.5.16	So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. 
GAL.5.17	For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever
GAL.5.18	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
GAL.5.19	The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 
GAL.5.20	idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 
GAL.5.21	and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
GAL.5.23	gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. 
GAL.5.24	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 
GAL.5.25	Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. 
GAL.5.26	Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
GAL.6.1	Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted. 
GAL.6.2	Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. 
GAL.6.3	If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves. 
GAL.6.4	Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else, 
GAL.6.5	for each one should carry their own load. 
GAL.6.6	Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor.
GAL.6.7	Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. 
GAL.6.8	Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. 
GAL.6.9	Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. 
GAL.6.10	Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.
GAL.6.11	See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!
GAL.6.12	Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
GAL.6.13	Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh. 
GAL.6.14	May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which
GAL.6.15	Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation. 
GAL.6.16	Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to
GAL.6.17	From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
GAL.6.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.
EPH.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
EPH.1.1	To God’s holy people in Ephesus,
EPH.1.2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ. 
EPH.1.4	For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love 
EPH.1.5	he
EPH.1.6	to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves. 
EPH.1.7	In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace 
EPH.1.8	that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding, 
EPH.1.9	he
EPH.1.10	to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.
EPH.1.11	In him we were also chosen,
EPH.1.12	in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory. 
EPH.1.13	And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, 
EPH.1.14	who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.
EPH.1.15	For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God’s people, 
EPH.1.16	I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers. 
EPH.1.17	I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit
EPH.1.18	I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, 
EPH.1.19	and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength 
EPH.1.20	he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, 
EPH.1.21	far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come. 
EPH.1.22	And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, 
EPH.1.23	which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.
EPH.2.1	As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, 
EPH.2.2	in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. 
EPH.2.3	All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh
EPH.2.4	But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, 
EPH.2.5	made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved. 
EPH.2.6	And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 
EPH.2.7	in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. 
EPH.2.8	For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 
EPH.2.9	not by works, so that no one can boast. 
EPH.2.10	For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
EPH.2.11	Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called “uncircumcised” by those who call themselves “the circumcision” (which is done in the body by human hands)— 
EPH.2.12	remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. 
EPH.2.13	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
EPH.2.14	For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, 
EPH.2.15	by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace, 
EPH.2.16	and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility. 
EPH.2.17	He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. 
EPH.2.18	For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
EPH.2.19	Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household, 
EPH.2.20	built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. 
EPH.2.21	In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. 
EPH.2.22	And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.
EPH.3.1	For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—
EPH.3.2	Surely you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that was given to me for you, 
EPH.3.3	that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. 
EPH.3.4	In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 
EPH.3.5	which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets. 
EPH.3.6	This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.
EPH.3.7	I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace given me through the working of his power. 
EPH.3.8	Although I am less than the least of all the Lord’s people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ, 
EPH.3.9	and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things. 
EPH.3.10	His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, 
EPH.3.11	according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
EPH.3.12	In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence. 
EPH.3.13	I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.
EPH.3.14	For this reason I kneel before the Father, 
EPH.3.15	from whom every family
EPH.3.16	I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 
EPH.3.17	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, 
EPH.3.18	may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 
EPH.3.19	and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
EPH.3.20	Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, 
EPH.3.21	to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
EPH.4.1	As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 
EPH.4.2	Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 
EPH.4.3	Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. 
EPH.4.4	There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; 
EPH.4.5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
EPH.4.7	But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. 
EPH.4.8	This is why it
EPH.4.8	“When he ascended on high,
EPH.4.8	he took many captives
EPH.4.8	and gave gifts to his people.”
EPH.4.9	(What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions
EPH.4.10	He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) 
EPH.4.11	So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 
EPH.4.12	to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 
EPH.4.13	until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
EPH.4.14	Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. 
EPH.4.15	Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. 
EPH.4.16	From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.
EPH.4.17	So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. 
EPH.4.18	They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. 
EPH.4.19	Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.
EPH.4.20	That, however, is not the way of life you learned 
EPH.4.21	when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. 
EPH.4.22	You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; 
EPH.4.23	to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 
EPH.4.24	and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
EPH.4.25	Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body. 
EPH.4.26	“In your anger do not sin”
EPH.4.27	and do not give the devil a foothold. 
EPH.4.28	Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need.
EPH.4.29	Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. 
EPH.4.30	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 
EPH.4.31	Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. 
EPH.4.32	Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
EPH.5.1	Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children 
EPH.5.2	and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
EPH.5.3	But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people. 
EPH.5.4	Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. 
EPH.5.5	For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
EPH.5.6	Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient. 
EPH.5.7	Therefore do not be partners with them.
EPH.5.8	For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light 
EPH.5.9	(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) 
EPH.5.10	and find out what pleases the Lord. 
EPH.5.11	Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. 
EPH.5.12	It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. 
EPH.5.13	But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light. 
EPH.5.14	This is why it is said:
EPH.5.14	“Wake up, sleeper,
EPH.5.14	rise from the dead,
EPH.5.14	and Christ will shine on you.”
EPH.5.15	Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, 
EPH.5.16	making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. 
EPH.5.17	Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is. 
EPH.5.18	Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit, 
EPH.5.19	speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, 
EPH.5.20	always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.5.21	Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
EPH.5.22	Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. 
EPH.5.23	For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 
EPH.5.24	Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 
EPH.5.26	to make her holy, cleansing
EPH.5.27	and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 
EPH.5.28	In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 
EPH.5.29	After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— 
EPH.5.30	for we are members of his body. 
EPH.5.31	“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”
EPH.5.32	This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. 
EPH.5.33	However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 
EPH.6.2	“Honor your father and mother”—which is the first commandment with a promise— 
EPH.6.3	“so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.”
EPH.6.4	Fathers,
EPH.6.5	Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. 
EPH.6.6	Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. 
EPH.6.7	Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people, 
EPH.6.8	because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free.
EPH.6.9	And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.
EPH.6.10	Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 
EPH.6.11	Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 
EPH.6.12	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 
EPH.6.13	Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 
EPH.6.14	Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 
EPH.6.15	and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 
EPH.6.16	In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 
EPH.6.17	Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
EPH.6.18	And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. 
EPH.6.19	Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, 
EPH.6.20	for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.
EPH.6.21	Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing. 
EPH.6.22	I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you.
EPH.6.23	Peace to the brothers and sisters,
EPH.6.24	Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
PHP.1.1	Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,
PHP.1.1	To all God’s holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons
PHP.1.2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.3	I thank my God every time I remember you. 
PHP.1.4	In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy 
PHP.1.5	because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, 
PHP.1.6	being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
PHP.1.7	It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God’s grace with me. 
PHP.1.8	God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
PHP.1.9	And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, 
PHP.1.10	so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 
PHP.1.11	filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.
PHP.1.12	Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters,
PHP.1.13	As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard
PHP.1.14	And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear.
PHP.1.15	It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. 
PHP.1.16	The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. 
PHP.1.17	The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. 
PHP.1.18	But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.
PHP.1.18	Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, 
PHP.1.19	for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.
PHP.1.20	I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. 
PHP.1.21	For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. 
PHP.1.22	If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! 
PHP.1.23	I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; 
PHP.1.24	but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. 
PHP.1.25	Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, 
PHP.1.26	so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.
PHP.1.27	Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit,
PHP.1.28	without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God. 
PHP.1.29	For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him, 
PHP.1.30	since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.
PHP.2.1	Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, 
PHP.2.2	then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. 
PHP.2.3	Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, 
PHP.2.4	not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.
PHP.2.5	In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
PHP.2.6	Who, being in very nature
PHP.2.6	did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
PHP.2.7	rather, he made himself nothing
PHP.2.7	by taking the very nature
PHP.2.7	being made in human likeness.
PHP.2.8	And being found in appearance as a man,
PHP.2.8	he humbled himself
PHP.2.8	by becoming obedient to death—
PHP.2.8	even death on a cross!
PHP.2.9	Therefore God exalted him to the highest place
PHP.2.9	and gave him the name that is above every name,
PHP.2.10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
PHP.2.10	in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
PHP.2.11	and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,
PHP.2.11	to the glory of God the Father.
PHP.2.12	Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, 
PHP.2.13	for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.
PHP.2.14	Do everything without grumbling or arguing, 
PHP.2.15	so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.”
PHP.2.16	as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. 
PHP.2.17	But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. 
PHP.2.18	So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.
PHP.2.19	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you. 
PHP.2.20	I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare. 
PHP.2.21	For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 
PHP.2.22	But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel. 
PHP.2.23	I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. 
PHP.2.24	And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.
PHP.2.25	But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs. 
PHP.2.26	For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill. 
PHP.2.27	Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. 
PHP.2.28	Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety. 
PHP.2.29	So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, 
PHP.2.30	because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me.
PHP.3.1	Further, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. 
PHP.3.2	Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh. 
PHP.3.3	For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh— 
PHP.3.4	though I myself have reasons for such confidence.
PHP.3.4	If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: 
PHP.3.5	circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; 
PHP.3.6	as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless.
PHP.3.7	But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. 
PHP.3.8	What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ 
PHP.3.9	and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in
PHP.3.10	I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 
PHP.3.11	and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.
PHP.3.12	Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 
PHP.3.13	Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 
PHP.3.14	I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
PHP.3.15	All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you. 
PHP.3.16	Only let us live up to what we have already attained.
PHP.3.17	Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do. 
PHP.3.18	For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. 
PHP.3.19	Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. 
PHP.3.20	But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, 
PHP.3.21	who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends!
PHP.4.2	I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord. 
PHP.4.3	Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! 
PHP.4.5	Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. 
PHP.4.6	Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.8	Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. 
PHP.4.9	Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.
PHP.4.10	I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. 
PHP.4.11	I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 
PHP.4.12	I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 
PHP.4.13	I can do all this through him who gives me strength.
PHP.4.14	Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. 
PHP.4.15	Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; 
PHP.4.16	for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need. 
PHP.4.17	Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account. 
PHP.4.18	I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. 
PHP.4.19	And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.20	To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
PHP.4.21	Greet all God’s people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings. 
PHP.4.22	All God’s people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar’s household.
PHP.4.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
COL.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
COL.1.2	To God’s holy people in Colossae, the faithful brothers and sisters
COL.1.2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father.
COL.1.3	We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, 
COL.1.4	because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all God’s people— 
COL.1.5	the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel 
COL.1.6	that has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world—just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God’s grace. 
COL.1.7	You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant,
COL.1.8	and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.
COL.1.9	For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,
COL.1.10	so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, 
COL.1.11	being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, 
COL.1.12	and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you
COL.1.13	For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, 
COL.1.14	in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
COL.1.15	The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 
COL.1.16	For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. 
COL.1.17	He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. 
COL.1.18	And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. 
COL.1.19	For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, 
COL.1.20	and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.
COL.1.21	Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of
COL.1.22	But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation— 
COL.1.23	if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
COL.1.24	Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. 
COL.1.25	I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness— 
COL.1.26	the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s people. 
COL.1.27	To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
COL.1.28	He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ. 
COL.1.29	To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.
COL.2.1	I want you to know how hard I am contending for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally. 
COL.2.2	My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, 
COL.2.3	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
COL.2.4	I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments. 
COL.2.5	For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.
COL.2.6	So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, 
COL.2.7	rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.
COL.2.8	See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces
COL.2.9	For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, 
COL.2.10	and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority. 
COL.2.11	In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh
COL.2.12	having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
COL.2.13	When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you
COL.2.14	having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. 
COL.2.15	And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.
COL.2.16	Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. 
COL.2.17	These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. 
COL.2.18	Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you. Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind. 
COL.2.19	They have lost connection with the head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.
COL.2.20	Since you died with Christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its rules: 
COL.2.21	“Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”? 
COL.2.22	These rules, which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with use, are based on merely human commands and teachings. 
COL.2.23	Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
COL.3.1	Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
COL.3.2	Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 
COL.3.3	For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	When Christ, who is your
COL.3.5	Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. 
COL.3.6	Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
COL.3.7	You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 
COL.3.8	But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 
COL.3.9	Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices 
COL.3.10	and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. 
COL.3.11	Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.
COL.3.12	Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 
COL.3.13	Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. 
COL.3.14	And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.
COL.3.15	Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. 
COL.3.16	Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. 
COL.3.17	And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
COL.3.18	Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
COL.3.20	Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
COL.3.21	Fathers,
COL.3.22	Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. 
COL.3.23	Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, 
COL.3.24	since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. 
COL.3.25	Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism.
COL.4.1	Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.
COL.4.2	Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. 
COL.4.3	And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. 
COL.4.4	Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. 
COL.4.5	Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. 
COL.4.6	Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.
COL.4.7	Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant
COL.4.8	I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our
COL.4.9	He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.
COL.4.10	My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.) 
COL.4.11	Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews
COL.4.12	Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured. 
COL.4.13	I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis. 
COL.4.14	Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings. 
COL.4.15	Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.
COL.4.16	After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.
COL.4.17	Tell Archippus: “See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.”
COL.4.18	I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
1TH.1.1	Paul, Silas
1TH.1.1	To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
1TH.1.1	Grace and peace to you.
1TH.1.2	We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers. 
1TH.1.3	We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.1.4	For we know, brothers and sisters
1TH.1.5	because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake. 
1TH.1.6	You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit. 
1TH.1.7	And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. 
1TH.1.8	The Lord’s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it, 
1TH.1.9	for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 
1TH.1.10	and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.
1TH.2.1	You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results. 
1TH.2.2	We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition. 
1TH.2.3	For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you. 
1TH.2.4	On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please people but God, who tests our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed—God is our witness. 
1TH.2.6	We were not looking for praise from people, not from you or anyone else, even though as apostles of Christ we could have asserted our authority. 
1TH.2.7	Instead, we were like young children
1TH.2.7	Just as a nursing mother cares for her children, 
1TH.2.8	so we cared for you. Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well. 
1TH.2.9	Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you. 
1TH.2.10	You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed. 
1TH.2.11	For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children, 
1TH.2.12	encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.13	And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe. 
1TH.2.14	For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God’s churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews 
1TH.2.15	who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to everyone 
1TH.2.16	in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.
1TH.2.17	But, brothers and sisters, when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you. 
1TH.2.18	For we wanted to come to you—certainly I, Paul, did, again and again—but Satan blocked our way. 
1TH.2.19	For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you? 
1TH.2.20	Indeed, you are our glory and joy.
1TH.3.1	So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens. 
1TH.3.2	We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God’s service in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith, 
1TH.3.3	so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. For you know quite well that we are destined for them. 
1TH.3.4	In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know. 
1TH.3.5	For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain.
1TH.3.6	But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you. 
1TH.3.7	Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith. 
1TH.3.8	For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord. 
1TH.3.9	How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you? 
1TH.3.10	Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.
1TH.3.11	Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you. 
1TH.3.12	May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you. 
1TH.3.13	May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
1TH.4.1	As for other matters, brothers and sisters, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more. 
1TH.4.2	For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
1TH.4.3	It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; 
1TH.4.4	that each of you should learn to control your own body
1TH.4.5	not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God; 
1TH.4.6	and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister.
1TH.4.7	For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. 
1TH.4.8	Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
1TH.4.9	Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other. 
1TH.4.10	And in fact, you do love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, 
1TH.4.11	and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, 
1TH.4.12	so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.
1TH.4.13	Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope. 
1TH.4.14	For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. 
1TH.4.15	According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. 
1TH.4.16	For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 
1TH.4.17	After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. 
1TH.4.18	Therefore encourage one another with these words.
1TH.5.1	Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, 
1TH.5.2	for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 
1TH.5.3	While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
1TH.5.4	But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. 
1TH.5.5	You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. 
1TH.5.6	So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. 
1TH.5.7	For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. 
1TH.5.9	For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.5.10	He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him. 
1TH.5.11	Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.
1TH.5.12	Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. 
1TH.5.13	Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. 
1TH.5.14	And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone. 
1TH.5.15	Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.
1TH.5.16	Rejoice always, 
1TH.5.17	pray continually, 
1TH.5.18	give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.
1TH.5.19	Do not quench the Spirit. 
1TH.5.20	Do not treat prophecies with contempt 
1TH.5.21	but test them all; hold on to what is good, 
1TH.5.22	reject every kind of evil.
1TH.5.23	May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.5.24	The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
1TH.5.25	Brothers and sisters, pray for us. 
1TH.5.26	Greet all God’s people with a holy kiss. 
1TH.5.27	I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2TH.1.1	Paul, Silas
2TH.1.1	To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2TH.1.2	Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.3	We ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters,
2TH.1.4	Therefore, among God’s churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.
2TH.1.5	All this is evidence that God’s judgment is right, and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering. 
2TH.1.6	God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you 
2TH.1.7	and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels. 
2TH.1.8	He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
2TH.1.9	They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might 
2TH.1.10	on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed our testimony to you.
2TH.1.11	With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling, and that by his power he may bring to fruition your every desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith. 
2TH.1.12	We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.1	Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, 
2TH.2.2	not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that the day of the Lord has already come. 
2TH.2.3	Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness
2TH.2.4	He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.
2TH.2.5	Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? 
2TH.2.6	And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. 
2TH.2.7	For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. 
2TH.2.8	And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. 
2TH.2.9	The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, 
2TH.2.10	and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 
2TH.2.11	For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie 
2TH.2.12	and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.
2TH.2.13	But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits
2TH.2.14	He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.15	So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings
2TH.2.16	May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope, 
2TH.2.17	encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
2TH.3.1	As for other matters, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you. 
2TH.3.2	And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not everyone has faith. 
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one. 
2TH.3.4	We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command. 
2TH.3.5	May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance.
2TH.3.6	In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching
2TH.3.7	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you, 
2TH.3.8	nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you. 
2TH.3.9	We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate. 
2TH.3.10	For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.”
2TH.3.11	We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive. They are not busy; they are busybodies. 
2TH.3.12	Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the food they eat. 
2TH.3.13	And as for you, brothers and sisters, never tire of doing what is good.
2TH.3.14	Take special note of anyone who does not obey our instruction in this letter. Do not associate with them, in order that they may feel ashamed. 
2TH.3.15	Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as you would a fellow believer.
2TH.3.16	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
2TH.3.17	I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write.
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
1TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,
1TI.1.2	To Timothy my true son in the faith:
1TI.1.2	Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
1TI.1.3	As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer 
1TI.1.4	or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God’s work—which is by faith. 
1TI.1.5	The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. 
1TI.1.6	Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk. 
1TI.1.7	They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.
1TI.1.8	We know that the law is good if one uses it properly. 
1TI.1.9	We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 
1TI.1.10	for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine 
1TI.1.11	that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.
1TI.1.12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service. 
1TI.1.13	Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. 
1TI.1.14	The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
1TI.1.15	Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. 
1TI.1.16	But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. 
1TI.1.17	Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
1TI.1.18	Timothy, my son, I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well, 
1TI.1.19	holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith. 
1TI.1.20	Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.
1TI.2.1	I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people— 
1TI.2.2	for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. 
1TI.2.3	This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 
1TI.2.4	who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
1TI.2.5	For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, 
1TI.2.6	who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time. 
1TI.2.7	And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.
1TI.2.8	Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. 
1TI.2.9	I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 
1TI.2.10	but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.
1TI.2.11	A woman
1TI.2.12	I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;
1TI.2.13	For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
1TI.2.14	And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 
1TI.2.15	But women
1TI.3.1	Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. 
1TI.3.2	Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 
1TI.3.3	not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 
1TI.3.4	He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full
1TI.3.5	(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) 
1TI.3.6	He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. 
1TI.3.7	He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.
1TI.3.8	In the same way, deacons
1TI.3.9	They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 
1TI.3.10	They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.
1TI.3.11	In the same way, the women
1TI.3.12	A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. 
1TI.3.13	Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that, 
1TI.3.15	if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. 
1TI.3.16	Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great:
1TI.3.16	He appeared in the flesh,
1TI.3.16	was vindicated by the Spirit,
1TI.3.16	was seen by angels,
1TI.3.16	was preached among the nations,
1TI.3.16	was believed on in the world,
1TI.3.16	was taken up in glory.
1TI.4.1	The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. 
1TI.4.2	Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. 
1TI.4.3	They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. 
1TI.4.4	For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 
1TI.4.5	because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.
1TI.4.6	If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters,
1TI.4.7	Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales; rather, train yourself to be godly. 
1TI.4.8	For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. 
1TI.4.9	This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance. 
1TI.4.10	That is why we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.
1TI.4.11	Command and teach these things. 
1TI.4.12	Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity. 
1TI.4.13	Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. 
1TI.4.14	Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.
1TI.4.15	Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. 
1TI.4.16	Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
1TI.5.1	Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, 
1TI.5.2	older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.
1TI.5.3	Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need. 
1TI.5.4	But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. 
1TI.5.5	The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. 
1TI.5.6	But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. 
1TI.5.7	Give the people these instructions, so that no one may be open to blame. 
1TI.5.8	Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
1TI.5.9	No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, 
1TI.5.10	and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.
1TI.5.11	As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. 
1TI.5.12	Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge. 
1TI.5.13	Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also busybodies who talk nonsense, saying things they ought not to. 
1TI.5.14	So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. 
1TI.5.15	Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.
1TI.5.16	If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care, she should continue to help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.
1TI.5.17	The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. 
1TI.5.18	For Scripture says, “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,”
1TI.5.19	Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. 
1TI.5.20	But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning. 
1TI.5.21	I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism.
1TI.5.22	Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.
1TI.5.23	Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.
1TI.5.24	The sins of some are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them. 
1TI.5.25	In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden forever.
1TI.6.1	All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered. 
1TI.6.2	Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare
1TI.6.2	These are the things you are to teach and insist on. 
1TI.6.3	If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, 
1TI.6.4	they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions 
1TI.6.5	and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.
1TI.6.6	But godliness with contentment is great gain. 
1TI.6.7	For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. 
1TI.6.8	But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. 
1TI.6.9	Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
1TI.6.11	But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness. 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 
1TI.6.13	In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you 
1TI.6.14	to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TI.6.15	which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 
1TI.6.16	who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.
1TI.6.17	Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. 
1TI.6.18	Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. 
1TI.6.19	In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.
1TI.6.20	Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, 
1TI.6.21	which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith.
1TI.6.21	Grace be with you all.
2TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,
2TI.1.2	To Timothy, my dear son:
2TI.1.2	Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2TI.1.3	I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. 
2TI.1.4	Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. 
2TI.1.5	I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.
2TI.1.6	For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
2TI.1.7	For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. 
2TI.1.8	So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God. 
2TI.1.9	He has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, 
2TI.1.10	but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. 
2TI.1.11	And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher. 
2TI.1.12	That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.
2TI.1.13	What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.1.14	Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
2TI.1.15	You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
2TI.1.16	May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains. 
2TI.1.17	On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me. 
2TI.1.18	May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.
2TI.2.1	You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.2	And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others. 
2TI.2.3	Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.4	No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer. 
2TI.2.5	Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor’s crown except by competing according to the rules. 
2TI.2.6	The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops. 
2TI.2.7	Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.
2TI.2.8	Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel, 
2TI.2.9	for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained. 
2TI.2.10	Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
2TI.2.11	Here is a trustworthy saying:
2TI.2.11	If we died with him,
2TI.2.11	we will also live with him;
2TI.2.12	if we endure,
2TI.2.12	we will also reign with him.
2TI.2.12	If we disown him,
2TI.2.12	he will also disown us;
2TI.2.13	if we are faithless,
2TI.2.13	he remains faithful,
2TI.2.13	for he cannot disown himself.
2TI.2.14	Keep reminding God’s people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. 
2TI.2.15	Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. 
2TI.2.16	Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. 
2TI.2.17	Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
2TI.2.18	who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. 
2TI.2.19	Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.”
2TI.2.20	In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use. 
2TI.2.21	Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.
2TI.2.22	Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
2TI.2.23	Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. 
2TI.2.24	And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. 
2TI.2.25	Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, 
2TI.2.26	and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.
2TI.3.1	But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 
2TI.3.2	People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
2TI.3.3	without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 
2TI.3.4	treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— 
2TI.3.5	having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.
2TI.3.6	They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires, 
2TI.3.7	always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
2TI.3.8	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these teachers oppose the truth. They are men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected. 
2TI.3.9	But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.
2TI.3.10	You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, 
2TI.3.11	persecutions, sufferings—what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them. 
2TI.3.12	In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 
2TI.3.13	while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
2TI.3.14	But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, 
2TI.3.15	and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 
2TI.3.17	so that the servant of God
2TI.4.1	In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: 
2TI.4.2	Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction. 
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 
2TI.4.4	They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. 
2TI.4.5	But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.
2TI.4.6	For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. 
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 
2TI.4.8	Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.
2TI.4.9	Do your best to come to me quickly, 
2TI.4.10	for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. 
2TI.4.11	Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry. 
2TI.4.12	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 
2TI.4.13	When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.
2TI.4.14	Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done. 
2TI.4.15	You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message.
2TI.4.16	At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. 
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion’s mouth. 
2TI.4.18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
2TI.4.19	Greet Priscilla
2TI.4.20	Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. 
2TI.4.21	Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers and sisters.
2TI.4.22	The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
TIT.1.1	Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness— 
TIT.1.2	in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time, 
TIT.1.3	and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,
TIT.1.4	To Titus, my true son in our common faith:
TIT.1.4	Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
TIT.1.5	The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint
TIT.1.6	An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe
TIT.1.7	Since an overseer manages God’s household, he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain. 
TIT.1.8	Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined. 
TIT.1.9	He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
TIT.1.10	For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group. 
TIT.1.11	They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain. 
TIT.1.12	One of Crete’s own prophets has said it: “Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.”
TIT.1.13	This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith 
TIT.1.14	and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth. 
TIT.1.15	To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted. 
TIT.1.16	They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.
TIT.2.1	You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine. 
TIT.2.2	Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.
TIT.2.3	Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. 
TIT.2.4	Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, 
TIT.2.5	to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.
TIT.2.6	Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. 
TIT.2.7	In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness 
TIT.2.8	and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.
TIT.2.9	Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, 
TIT.2.10	and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. 
TIT.2.12	It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, 
TIT.2.13	while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, 
TIT.2.14	who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.
TIT.2.15	These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.
TIT.3.1	Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good, 
TIT.3.2	to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle toward everyone.
TIT.3.3	At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. 
TIT.3.4	But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, 
TIT.3.5	he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, 
TIT.3.6	whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
TIT.3.7	so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. 
TIT.3.8	This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.
TIT.3.9	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless. 
TIT.3.10	Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them. 
TIT.3.11	You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.
TIT.3.12	As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there. 
TIT.3.13	Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need. 
TIT.3.14	Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order to provide for urgent needs and not live unproductive lives.
TIT.3.15	Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith.
TIT.3.15	Grace be with you all.
PHM.1.1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,
PHM.1.1	To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker— 
PHM.1.2	also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church that meets in your home:
PHM.1.3	Grace and peace to you
PHM.1.4	I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, 
PHM.1.5	because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus. 
PHM.1.6	I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ. 
PHM.1.7	Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord’s people.
PHM.1.8	Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do, 
PHM.1.9	yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus— 
PHM.1.10	that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus,
PHM.1.11	Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.
PHM.1.12	I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you. 
PHM.1.13	I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. 
PHM.1.14	But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary. 
PHM.1.15	Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever— 
PHM.1.16	no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord.
PHM.1.17	So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. 
PHM.1.18	If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. 
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self. 
PHM.1.20	I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 
PHM.1.21	Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
PHM.1.22	And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.
PHM.1.23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. 
PHM.1.24	And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.
PHM.1.25	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
HEB.1.1	In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, 
HEB.1.2	but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe. 
HEB.1.3	The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. 
HEB.1.4	So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.
HEB.1.5	For to which of the angels did God ever say,
HEB.1.5	“You are my Son;
HEB.1.5	today I have become your Father”
HEB.1.5	Or again,
HEB.1.5	“I will be his Father,
HEB.1.5	and he will be my Son”
HEB.1.6	And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says,
HEB.1.6	“Let all God’s angels worship him.”
HEB.1.7	In speaking of the angels he says,
HEB.1.7	“He makes his angels spirits,
HEB.1.7	and his servants flames of fire.”
HEB.1.8	But about the Son he says,
HEB.1.8	“Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever;
HEB.1.8	a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.
HEB.1.9	You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
HEB.1.9	therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions
HEB.1.9	by anointing you with the oil of joy.”
HEB.1.10	He also says,
HEB.1.10	“In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth,
HEB.1.10	and the heavens are the work of your hands.
HEB.1.11	They will perish, but you remain;
HEB.1.11	they will all wear out like a garment.
HEB.1.12	You will roll them up like a robe;
HEB.1.12	like a garment they will be changed.
HEB.1.12	But you remain the same,
HEB.1.12	and your years will never end.”
HEB.1.13	To which of the angels did God ever say,
HEB.1.13	“Sit at my right hand
HEB.1.13	until I make your enemies
HEB.1.13	a footstool for your feet”
HEB.1.14	Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
HEB.2.1	We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. 
HEB.2.2	For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, 
HEB.2.3	how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. 
HEB.2.4	God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.
HEB.2.5	It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking. 
HEB.2.6	But there is a place where someone has testified:
HEB.2.6	“What is mankind that you are mindful of them,
HEB.2.6	a son of man that you care for him?
HEB.2.7	You made them a little
HEB.2.7	you crowned them with glory and honor
HEB.2.8	and put everything under their feet.”
HEB.2.8	In putting everything under them,
HEB.2.9	But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
HEB.2.10	In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered. 
HEB.2.11	Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.
HEB.2.12	He says,
HEB.2.12	“I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters;
HEB.2.12	in the assembly I will sing your praises.”
HEB.2.13	And again,
HEB.2.13	“I will put my trust in him.”
HEB.2.13	And again he says,
HEB.2.13	“Here am I, and the children God has given me.”
HEB.2.14	Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil— 
HEB.2.15	and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. 
HEB.2.16	For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham’s descendants. 
HEB.2.17	For this reason he had to be made like them,
HEB.2.18	Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
HEB.3.1	Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest. 
HEB.3.2	He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house. 
HEB.3.3	Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. 
HEB.3.4	For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything. 
HEB.3.5	“Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house,”
HEB.3.6	But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory.
HEB.3.7	So, as the Holy Spirit says:
HEB.3.7	“Today, if you hear his voice,
HEB.3.8	do not harden your hearts
HEB.3.8	as you did in the rebellion,
HEB.3.8	during the time of testing in the wilderness,
HEB.3.9	where your ancestors tested and tried me,
HEB.3.9	though for forty years they saw what I did.
HEB.3.10	That is why I was angry with that generation;
HEB.3.10	I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray,
HEB.3.10	and they have not known my ways.’
HEB.3.11	So I declared on oath in my anger,
HEB.3.11	‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”
HEB.3.12	See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. 
HEB.3.13	But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness. 
HEB.3.14	We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end. 
HEB.3.15	As has just been said:
HEB.3.15	“Today, if you hear his voice,
HEB.3.15	do not harden your hearts
HEB.3.15	as you did in the rebellion.”
HEB.3.16	Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? 
HEB.3.17	And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness? 
HEB.3.18	And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed? 
HEB.3.19	So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.
HEB.4.1	Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. 
HEB.4.2	For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.
HEB.4.3	Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said,
HEB.4.3	“So I declared on oath in my anger,
HEB.4.3	‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”
HEB.4.3	And yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world. 
HEB.4.4	For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: “On the seventh day God rested from all his works.”
HEB.4.5	And again in the passage above he says, “They shall never enter my rest.”
HEB.4.6	Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience, 
HEB.4.7	God again set a certain day, calling it “Today.” This he did when a long time later he spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted:
HEB.4.7	“Today, if you hear his voice,
HEB.4.7	do not harden your hearts.”
HEB.4.8	For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. 
HEB.4.9	There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; 
HEB.4.10	for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works,
HEB.4.11	Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. 
HEB.4.13	Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
HEB.4.14	Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven,
HEB.4.15	For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. 
HEB.4.16	Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
HEB.5.1	Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
HEB.5.2	He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. 
HEB.5.3	This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. 
HEB.5.4	And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was.
HEB.5.5	In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him,
HEB.5.5	“You are my Son;
HEB.5.5	today I have become your Father.”
HEB.5.6	And he says in another place,
HEB.5.6	“You are a priest forever,
HEB.5.6	in the order of Melchizedek.”
HEB.5.7	During the days of Jesus’ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. 
HEB.5.8	Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered 
HEB.5.9	and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him 
HEB.5.10	and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.
HEB.5.11	We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand. 
HEB.5.12	In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God’s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! 
HEB.5.13	Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. 
HEB.5.14	But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.
HEB.6.1	Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death,
HEB.6.2	instruction about cleansing rites,
HEB.6.3	And God permitting, we will do so.
HEB.6.4	It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, 
HEB.6.5	who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age 
HEB.6.6	and who have fallen
HEB.6.7	Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God. 
HEB.6.8	But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.
HEB.6.9	Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case—the things that have to do with salvation. 
HEB.6.10	God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them. 
HEB.6.11	We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized. 
HEB.6.12	We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.
HEB.6.13	When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself, 
HEB.6.14	saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.”
HEB.6.15	And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.
HEB.6.16	People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument. 
HEB.6.17	Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath. 
HEB.6.18	God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged. 
HEB.6.19	We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, 
HEB.6.20	where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.
HEB.7.1	This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him, 
HEB.7.2	and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means “king of righteousness”; then also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.” 
HEB.7.3	Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.
HEB.7.4	Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder! 
HEB.7.5	Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people—that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though they also are descended from Abraham. 
HEB.7.6	This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. 
HEB.7.7	And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater. 
HEB.7.8	In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living. 
HEB.7.9	One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham, 
HEB.7.10	because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.
HEB.7.11	If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron? 
HEB.7.12	For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also. 
HEB.7.13	He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar. 
HEB.7.14	For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests. 
HEB.7.15	And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, 
HEB.7.16	one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life. 
HEB.7.17	For it is declared:
HEB.7.17	“You are a priest forever,
HEB.7.17	in the order of Melchizedek.”
HEB.7.18	The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless 
HEB.7.19	(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.
HEB.7.20	And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath, 
HEB.7.21	but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him:
HEB.7.21	“The Lord has sworn
HEB.7.21	and will not change his mind:
HEB.7.21	‘You are a priest forever.’ ”
HEB.7.22	Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.
HEB.7.23	Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; 
HEB.7.24	but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. 
HEB.7.25	Therefore he is able to save completely
HEB.7.26	Such a high priest truly meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. 
HEB.7.27	Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. 
HEB.7.28	For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.
HEB.8.1	Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, 
HEB.8.2	and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being.
HEB.8.3	Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer. 
HEB.8.4	If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. 
HEB.8.5	They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”
HEB.8.6	But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.
HEB.8.7	For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another. 
HEB.8.8	But God found fault with the people and said
HEB.8.8	“The days are coming, declares the Lord,
HEB.8.8	when I will make a new covenant
HEB.8.8	with the people of Israel
HEB.8.8	and with the people of Judah.
HEB.8.9	It will not be like the covenant
HEB.8.9	I made with their ancestors
HEB.8.9	when I took them by the hand
HEB.8.9	to lead them out of Egypt,
HEB.8.9	because they did not remain faithful to my covenant,
HEB.8.9	and I turned away from them,
HEB.8.9	declares the Lord.
HEB.8.10	This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel
HEB.8.10	after that time, declares the Lord.
HEB.8.10	I will put my laws in their minds
HEB.8.10	and write them on their hearts.
HEB.8.10	I will be their God,
HEB.8.10	and they will be my people.
HEB.8.11	No longer will they teach their neighbor,
HEB.8.11	or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’
HEB.8.11	because they will all know me,
HEB.8.11	from the least of them to the greatest.
HEB.8.12	For I will forgive their wickedness
HEB.8.12	and will remember their sins no more.”
HEB.8.13	By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.
HEB.9.1	Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. 
HEB.9.2	A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. 
HEB.9.3	Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, 
HEB.9.4	which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. 
HEB.9.5	Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.
HEB.9.6	When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry. 
HEB.9.7	But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. 
HEB.9.8	The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning. 
HEB.9.9	This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. 
HEB.9.10	They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings—external regulations applying until the time of the new order.
HEB.9.11	But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here,
HEB.9.12	He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining
HEB.9.13	The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. 
HEB.9.14	How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death,
HEB.9.15	For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.
HEB.9.16	In the case of a will,
HEB.9.17	because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living. 
HEB.9.18	This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood. 
HEB.9.19	When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people. 
HEB.9.20	He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.”
HEB.9.21	In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies. 
HEB.9.22	In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
HEB.9.23	It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
HEB.9.24	For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God’s presence. 
HEB.9.25	Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. 
HEB.9.26	Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
HEB.9.27	Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, 
HEB.9.28	so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.
HEB.10.1	The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. 
HEB.10.2	Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. 
HEB.10.3	But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins. 
HEB.10.4	It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
HEB.10.5	Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said:
HEB.10.5	“Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,
HEB.10.5	but a body you prepared for me;
HEB.10.6	with burnt offerings and sin offerings
HEB.10.6	you were not pleased.
HEB.10.7	Then I said, ‘Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll—
HEB.10.7	I have come to do your will, my God.’ ”
HEB.10.8	First he said, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them”—though they were offered in accordance with the law. 
HEB.10.9	Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second. 
HEB.10.10	And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
HEB.10.11	Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. 
HEB.10.12	But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, 
HEB.10.13	and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool. 
HEB.10.14	For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.
HEB.10.15	The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:
HEB.10.16	“This is the covenant I will make with them
HEB.10.16	after that time, says the Lord.
HEB.10.16	I will put my laws in their hearts,
HEB.10.16	and I will write them on their minds.”
HEB.10.17	Then he adds:
HEB.10.17	“Their sins and lawless acts
HEB.10.17	I will remember no more.”
HEB.10.18	And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.
HEB.10.19	Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, 
HEB.10.20	by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, 
HEB.10.21	and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 
HEB.10.22	let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. 
HEB.10.23	Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. 
HEB.10.24	And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, 
HEB.10.25	not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
HEB.10.26	If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, 
HEB.10.27	but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. 
HEB.10.28	Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
HEB.10.29	How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? 
HEB.10.30	For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”
HEB.10.31	It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering. 
HEB.10.33	Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated. 
HEB.10.34	You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions. 
HEB.10.35	So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.
HEB.10.36	You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. 
HEB.10.37	For,
HEB.10.37	“In just a little while,
HEB.10.37	he who is coming will come
HEB.10.37	and will not delay.”
HEB.10.38	And,
HEB.10.38	“But my righteous
HEB.10.38	And I take no pleasure
HEB.10.38	in the one who shrinks back.”
HEB.10.39	But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.
HEB.11.1	Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. 
HEB.11.2	This is what the ancients were commended for.
HEB.11.3	By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.
HEB.11.4	By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead.
HEB.11.5	By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: “He could not be found, because God had taken him away.”
HEB.11.6	And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
HEB.11.7	By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith.
HEB.11.8	By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. 
HEB.11.9	By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. 
HEB.11.10	For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 
HEB.11.11	And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she
HEB.11.12	And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.
HEB.11.13	All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. 
HEB.11.14	People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. 
HEB.11.15	If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. 
HEB.11.16	Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, 
HEB.11.18	even though God had said to him, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”
HEB.11.19	Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death.
HEB.11.20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.
HEB.11.21	By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
HEB.11.22	By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones.
HEB.11.23	By faith Moses’ parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.
HEB.11.24	By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. 
HEB.11.25	He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. 
HEB.11.26	He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. 
HEB.11.27	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. 
HEB.11.28	By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.
HEB.11.29	By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.
HEB.11.30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days.
HEB.11.31	By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.
HEB.11.32	And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets, 
HEB.11.33	who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, 
HEB.11.34	quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. 
HEB.11.35	Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection. 
HEB.11.36	Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. 
HEB.11.37	They were put to death by stoning;
HEB.11.38	the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.
HEB.11.39	These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised, 
HEB.11.40	since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.
HEB.12.1	Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, 
HEB.12.2	fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
HEB.12.3	Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
HEB.12.4	In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 
HEB.12.5	And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son? It says,
HEB.12.5	“My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline,
HEB.12.5	and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,
HEB.12.6	because the Lord disciplines the one he loves,
HEB.12.6	and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”
HEB.12.7	Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father? 
HEB.12.8	If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all. 
HEB.12.9	Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live! 
HEB.12.10	They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness. 
HEB.12.11	No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.
HEB.12.12	Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. 
HEB.12.13	“Make level paths for your feet,”
HEB.12.14	Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. 
HEB.12.15	See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many. 
HEB.12.16	See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son. 
HEB.12.17	Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. Even though he sought the blessing with tears, he could not change what he had done.
HEB.12.18	You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm; 
HEB.12.19	to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them, 
HEB.12.20	because they could not bear what was commanded: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death.”
HEB.12.21	The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”
HEB.12.22	But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly, 
HEB.12.23	to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, 
HEB.12.24	to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
HEB.12.25	See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven? 
HEB.12.26	At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.”
HEB.12.27	The words “once more” indicate the removing of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.
HEB.12.28	Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, 
HEB.12.29	for our “God is a consuming fire.”
HEB.13.1	Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters. 
HEB.13.2	Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it. 
HEB.13.3	Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.
HEB.13.4	Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. 
HEB.13.5	Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said,
HEB.13.5	“Never will I leave you;
HEB.13.5	never will I forsake you.”
HEB.13.6	So we say with confidence,
HEB.13.6	“The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.
HEB.13.6	What can mere mortals do to me?”
HEB.13.7	Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. 
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
HEB.13.9	Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by eating ceremonial foods, which is of no benefit to those who do so. 
HEB.13.10	We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat.
HEB.13.11	The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp. 
HEB.13.12	And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood. 
HEB.13.13	Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore. 
HEB.13.14	For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.
HEB.13.15	Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name. 
HEB.13.16	And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
HEB.13.17	Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you.
HEB.13.18	Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way. 
HEB.13.19	I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon.
HEB.13.20	Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, 
HEB.13.21	equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
HEB.13.22	Brothers and sisters, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for in fact I have written to you quite briefly.
HEB.13.23	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you.
HEB.13.24	Greet all your leaders and all the Lord’s people. Those from Italy send you their greetings.
HEB.13.25	Grace be with you all.
JAS.1.1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
JAS.1.1	To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations:
JAS.1.1	Greetings.
JAS.1.2	Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters,
JAS.1.3	because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. 
JAS.1.4	Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. 
JAS.1.5	If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. 
JAS.1.6	But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. 
JAS.1.7	That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. 
JAS.1.8	Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.
JAS.1.9	Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position. 
JAS.1.10	But the rich should take pride in their humiliation—since they will pass away like a wild flower. 
JAS.1.11	For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business.
JAS.1.12	Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.
JAS.1.13	When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; 
JAS.1.14	but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. 
JAS.1.15	Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.
JAS.1.16	Don’t be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters. 
JAS.1.17	Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. 
JAS.1.18	He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.
JAS.1.19	My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, 
JAS.1.20	because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires. 
JAS.1.21	Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.
JAS.1.22	Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 
JAS.1.23	Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror 
JAS.1.24	and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. 
JAS.1.25	But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.
JAS.1.26	Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless. 
JAS.1.27	Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
JAS.2.1	My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism. 
JAS.2.2	Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in. 
JAS.2.3	If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,” 
JAS.2.4	have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
JAS.2.5	Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? 
JAS.2.6	But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? 
JAS.2.7	Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong?
JAS.2.8	If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,”
JAS.2.9	But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. 
JAS.2.10	For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. 
JAS.2.11	For he who said, “You shall not commit adultery,”
JAS.2.12	Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, 
JAS.2.13	because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
JAS.2.14	What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? 
JAS.2.15	Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. 
JAS.2.16	If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? 
JAS.2.17	In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
JAS.2.18	But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.”
JAS.2.18	Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. 
JAS.2.19	You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.
JAS.2.20	You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless
JAS.2.21	Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? 
JAS.2.22	You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. 
JAS.2.23	And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,”
JAS.2.24	You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.
JAS.2.25	In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? 
JAS.2.26	As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
JAS.3.1	Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. 
JAS.3.2	We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check.
JAS.3.3	When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. 
JAS.3.4	Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. 
JAS.3.5	Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. 
JAS.3.6	The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one’s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.
JAS.3.7	All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind, 
JAS.3.8	but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
JAS.3.9	With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made in God’s likeness. 
JAS.3.10	Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this should not be. 
JAS.3.11	Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? 
JAS.3.12	My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
JAS.3.13	Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom. 
JAS.3.14	But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth. 
JAS.3.15	Such “wisdom” does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 
JAS.3.16	For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere. 
JAS.3.18	Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.
JAS.4.1	What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you? 
JAS.4.2	You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. 
JAS.4.3	When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.
JAS.4.4	You adulterous people,
JAS.4.5	Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us
JAS.4.6	But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says:
JAS.4.6	“God opposes the proud
JAS.4.6	but shows favor to the humble.”
JAS.4.7	Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
JAS.4.8	Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 
JAS.4.9	Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
JAS.4.11	Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister
JAS.4.12	There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you—who are you to judge your neighbor?
JAS.4.13	Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.” 
JAS.4.14	Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. 
JAS.4.15	Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.” 
JAS.4.16	As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil. 
JAS.4.17	If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them.
JAS.5.1	Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you. 
JAS.5.2	Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. 
JAS.5.4	Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. 
JAS.5.5	You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
JAS.5.6	You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.
JAS.5.7	Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord’s coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains. 
JAS.5.8	You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord’s coming is near. 
JAS.5.9	Don’t grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!
JAS.5.10	Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.11	As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job’s perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
JAS.5.12	Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. All you need to say is a simple “Yes” or “No.” Otherwise you will be condemned.
JAS.5.13	Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. 
JAS.5.14	Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.15	And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. 
JAS.5.16	Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years. 
JAS.5.18	Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.
JAS.5.19	My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, 
JAS.5.20	remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
1PE.1.1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
1PE.1.1	To God’s elect, exiles scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, 
1PE.1.2	who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood:
1PE.1.2	Grace and peace be yours in abundance.
1PE.1.3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
1PE.1.4	and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you, 
1PE.1.5	who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. 
1PE.1.6	In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. 
1PE.1.7	These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. 
1PE.1.8	Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, 
1PE.1.9	for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
1PE.1.10	Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, 
1PE.1.11	trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow. 
1PE.1.12	It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.
1PE.1.13	Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming. 
1PE.1.14	As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. 
1PE.1.15	But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; 
1PE.1.16	for it is written: “Be holy, because I am holy.”
1PE.1.17	Since you call on a Father who judges each person’s work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear. 
1PE.1.18	For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors, 
1PE.1.19	but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. 
1PE.1.20	He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. 
1PE.1.21	Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.
1PE.1.22	Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart.
1PE.1.23	For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. 
1PE.1.24	For,
1PE.1.24	“All people are like grass,
1PE.1.24	and all their glory is like the flowers of the field;
1PE.1.24	the grass withers and the flowers fall,
1PE.1.25	but the word of the Lord endures forever.”
1PE.1.25	And this is the word that was preached to you.
1PE.2.1	Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. 
1PE.2.2	Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, 
1PE.2.3	now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
1PE.2.4	As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him— 
1PE.2.5	you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house
1PE.2.6	For in Scripture it says:
1PE.2.6	“See, I lay a stone in Zion,
1PE.2.6	a chosen and precious cornerstone,
1PE.2.6	and the one who trusts in him
1PE.2.6	will never be put to shame.”
1PE.2.7	Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe,
1PE.2.7	“The stone the builders rejected
1PE.2.7	has become the cornerstone,”
1PE.2.8	and,
1PE.2.8	“A stone that causes people to stumble
1PE.2.8	and a rock that makes them fall.”
1PE.2.8	They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for.
1PE.2.9	But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. 
1PE.2.10	Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
1PE.2.11	Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. 
1PE.2.12	Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
1PE.2.13	Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, 
1PE.2.14	or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. 
1PE.2.15	For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. 
1PE.2.16	Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God’s slaves. 
1PE.2.17	Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.
1PE.2.18	Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. 
1PE.2.19	For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God. 
1PE.2.20	But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. 
1PE.2.21	To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.
1PE.2.22	“He committed no sin,
1PE.2.22	and no deceit was found in his mouth.”
1PE.2.23	When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. 
1PE.2.24	“He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.” 
1PE.2.25	For “you were like sheep going astray,”
1PE.3.1	Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, 
1PE.3.2	when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. 
1PE.3.3	Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. 
1PE.3.4	Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight. 
1PE.3.5	For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands, 
1PE.3.6	like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.
1PE.3.7	Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
1PE.3.8	Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. 
1PE.3.9	Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. 
1PE.3.10	For,
1PE.3.10	“Whoever would love life
1PE.3.10	and see good days
1PE.3.10	must keep their tongue from evil
1PE.3.10	and their lips from deceitful speech.
1PE.3.11	They must turn from evil and do good;
1PE.3.11	they must seek peace and pursue it.
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous
1PE.3.12	and his ears are attentive to their prayer,
1PE.3.12	but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”
1PE.3.13	Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? 
1PE.3.14	But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. “Do not fear their threats
1PE.3.15	But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, 
1PE.3.16	keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. 
1PE.3.17	For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. 
1PE.3.18	For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. 
1PE.3.19	After being made alive,
1PE.3.20	to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, 
1PE.3.21	and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God.
1PE.3.22	who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.
1PE.4.1	Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin. 
1PE.4.2	As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God. 
1PE.4.3	For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry. 
1PE.4.4	They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you. 
1PE.4.5	But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
1PE.4.6	For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.
1PE.4.7	The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray. 
1PE.4.8	Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. 
1PE.4.9	Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. 
1PE.4.10	Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms. 
1PE.4.11	If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.
1PE.4.12	Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 
1PE.4.13	But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. 
1PE.4.14	If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. 
1PE.4.15	If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. 
1PE.4.16	However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name. 
1PE.4.17	For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? 
1PE.4.18	And,
1PE.4.18	“If it is hard for the righteous to be saved,
1PE.4.18	what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”
1PE.4.19	So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.
1PE.5.1	To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed: 
1PE.5.2	Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve; 
1PE.5.3	not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. 
1PE.5.4	And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.
1PE.5.5	In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because,
1PE.5.5	“God opposes the proud
1PE.5.5	but shows favor to the humble.”
1PE.5.6	Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. 
1PE.5.7	Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
1PE.5.8	Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. 
1PE.5.9	Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
1PE.5.10	And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. 
1PE.5.11	To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.
1PE.5.12	With the help of Silas,
1PE.5.13	She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark. 
1PE.5.14	Greet one another with a kiss of love.
1PE.5.14	Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
2PE.1.1	Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,
2PE.1.1	To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours:
2PE.1.2	Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
2PE.1.3	His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. 
2PE.1.4	Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.
2PE.1.5	For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; 
2PE.1.6	and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; 
2PE.1.7	and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. 
2PE.1.8	For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2PE.1.9	But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins.
2PE.1.10	Therefore, my brothers and sisters,
2PE.1.11	and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.12	So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have. 
2PE.1.13	I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body, 
2PE.1.14	because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. 
2PE.1.15	And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.
2PE.1.16	For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 
2PE.1.17	He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”
2PE.1.18	We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.
2PE.1.19	We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. 
2PE.1.20	Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. 
2PE.1.21	For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
2PE.2.1	But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. 
2PE.2.2	Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 
2PE.2.3	In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.
2PE.2.4	For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell,
2PE.2.5	if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; 
2PE.2.6	if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; 
2PE.2.7	and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless 
2PE.2.8	(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)— 
2PE.2.9	if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment. 
2PE.2.10	This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh
2PE.2.10	Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings; 
2PE.2.11	yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from
2PE.2.12	But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals they too will perish.
2PE.2.13	They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.
2PE.2.14	With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed—an accursed brood! 
2PE.2.15	They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Bezer,
2PE.2.16	But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey—an animal without speech—who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.
2PE.2.17	These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them. 
2PE.2.18	For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error. 
2PE.2.19	They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity—for “people are slaves to whatever has mastered them.” 
2PE.2.20	If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. 
2PE.2.21	It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. 
2PE.2.22	Of them the proverbs are true: “A dog returns to its vomit,”
2PE.3.1	Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking. 
2PE.3.2	I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.
2PE.3.3	Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. 
2PE.3.4	They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.” 
2PE.3.5	But they deliberately forget that long ago by God’s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. 
2PE.3.6	By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. 
2PE.3.7	By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.
2PE.3.8	But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. 
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.
2PE.3.11	Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives 
2PE.3.12	as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming.
2PE.3.13	But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.
2PE.3.14	So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him. 
2PE.3.15	Bear in mind that our Lord’s patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. 
2PE.3.16	He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.
2PE.3.17	Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position. 
2PE.3.18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.
1JN.1.1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. 
1JN.1.2	The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 
1JN.1.3	We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 
1JN.1.4	We write this to make our
1JN.1.5	This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. 
1JN.1.6	If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. 
1JN.1.7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all
1JN.1.8	If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 
1JN.1.10	If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.
1JN.2.1	My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 
1JN.2.2	He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
1JN.2.3	We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands. 
1JN.2.4	Whoever says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. 
1JN.2.5	But if anyone obeys his word, love for God
1JN.2.6	Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.
1JN.2.7	Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. 
1JN.2.8	Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.
1JN.2.9	Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister
1JN.2.10	Anyone who loves their brother and sister
1JN.2.11	But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.
1JN.2.12	I am writing to you, dear children,
1JN.2.12	because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
1JN.2.13	I am writing to you, fathers,
1JN.2.13	because you know him who is from the beginning.
1JN.2.13	I am writing to you, young men,
1JN.2.13	because you have overcome the evil one.
1JN.2.14	I write to you, dear children,
1JN.2.14	because you know the Father.
1JN.2.14	I write to you, fathers,
1JN.2.14	because you know him who is from the beginning.
1JN.2.14	I write to you, young men,
1JN.2.14	because you are strong,
1JN.2.14	and the word of God lives in you,
1JN.2.14	and you have overcome the evil one.
1JN.2.15	Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father
1JN.2.16	For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. 
1JN.2.17	The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.
1JN.2.18	Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. 
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.
1JN.2.20	But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth.
1JN.2.21	I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. 
1JN.2.22	Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son. 
1JN.2.23	No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
1JN.2.24	As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. 
1JN.2.25	And this is what he promised us—eternal life.
1JN.2.26	I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. 
1JN.2.27	As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in him.
1JN.2.28	And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.
1JN.2.29	If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.
1JN.3.1	See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. 
1JN.3.2	Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears,
1JN.3.3	All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.
1JN.3.4	Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. 
1JN.3.5	But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin. 
1JN.3.6	No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.
1JN.3.7	Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. 
1JN.3.8	The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work. 
1JN.3.9	No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God. 
1JN.3.10	This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God’s child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister.
1JN.3.11	For this is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another. 
1JN.3.12	Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother’s were righteous. 
1JN.3.13	Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters,
1JN.3.14	We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death. 
1JN.3.15	Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.
1JN.3.16	This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. 
1JN.3.17	If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? 
1JN.3.18	Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.
1JN.3.19	This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence: 
1JN.3.20	If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 
1JN.3.21	Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God 
1JN.3.22	and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him. 
1JN.3.23	And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. 
1JN.3.24	The one who keeps God’s commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.
1JN.4.1	Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
1JN.4.2	This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 
1JN.4.3	but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.
1JN.4.4	You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 
1JN.4.5	They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. 
1JN.4.6	We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit
1JN.4.7	Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 
1JN.4.8	Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
1JN.4.9	This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 
1JN.4.10	This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 
1JN.4.11	Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
1JN.4.12	No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.
1JN.4.13	This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. 
1JN.4.14	And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 
1JN.4.15	If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 
1JN.4.16	And so we know and rely on the love God has for us.
1JN.4.16	God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. 
1JN.4.17	This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus. 
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
1JN.4.19	We love because he first loved us. 
1JN.4.20	Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. 
1JN.4.21	And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.
1JN.5.1	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. 
1JN.5.2	This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. 
1JN.5.3	In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, 
1JN.5.4	for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. 
1JN.5.5	Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
1JN.5.6	This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 
1JN.5.7	For there are three that testify: 
1JN.5.8	the
1JN.5.9	We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. 
1JN.5.10	Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. 
1JN.5.11	And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
1JN.5.12	Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
1JN.5.13	I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. 
1JN.5.14	This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 
1JN.5.15	And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him.
1JN.5.16	If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that. 
1JN.5.17	All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.
1JN.5.18	We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. 
1JN.5.19	We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. 
1JN.5.20	We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
1JN.5.21	Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.
2JN.1.1	The elder,
2JN.1.1	To the lady chosen by God and to her children, whom I love in the truth—and not I only, but also all who know the truth— 
2JN.1.2	because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son, will be with us in truth and love.
2JN.1.4	It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us. 
2JN.1.5	And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another. 
2JN.1.6	And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.
2JN.1.7	I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. 
2JN.1.8	Watch out that you do not lose what we
2JN.1.9	Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. 
2JN.1.10	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. 
2JN.1.11	Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.
2JN.1.12	I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
2JN.1.13	The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send their greetings.
3JN.1.1	The elder,
3JN.1.1	To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
3JN.1.2	Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well. 
3JN.1.3	It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it. 
3JN.1.4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
3JN.1.5	Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters,
3JN.1.6	They have told the church about your love. Please send them on their way in a manner that honors God. 
3JN.1.7	It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans. 
3JN.1.8	We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not welcome us. 
3JN.1.10	So when I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other believers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.
3JN.1.11	Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God. 
3JN.1.12	Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone—and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.
3JN.1.13	I have much to write you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink. 
3JN.1.14	I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.
3JN.1.14	Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.
JUD.1.1	Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James,
JUD.1.1	To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for
JUD.1.2	Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.
JUD.1.3	Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God’s holy people. 
JUD.1.4	For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about
JUD.1.5	Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord
JUD.1.6	And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day. 
JUD.1.7	In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
JUD.1.8	In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings. 
JUD.1.9	But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”
JUD.1.10	Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct—as irrational animals do—will destroy them.
JUD.1.11	Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam’s error; they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion.
JUD.1.12	These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm—shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted—twice dead. 
JUD.1.13	They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.
JUD.1.14	Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: “See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones 
JUD.1.15	to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”
JUD.1.16	These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.
JUD.1.17	But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold. 
JUD.1.18	They said to you, “In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.” 
JUD.1.19	These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.
JUD.1.20	But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, 
JUD.1.21	keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.
JUD.1.22	Be merciful to those who doubt; 
JUD.1.23	save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear—hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.
JUD.1.24	To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy— 
JUD.1.25	to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.
REV.1.1	The revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, 
REV.1.2	who testifies to everything he saw—that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
REV.1.3	Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.
REV.1.4	John,
REV.1.4	To the seven churches in the province of Asia:
REV.1.4	Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits
REV.1.5	and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
REV.1.5	To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, 
REV.1.6	and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.
REV.1.7	“Look, he is coming with the clouds,”
REV.1.7	and “every eye will see him,
REV.1.7	even those who pierced him”;
REV.1.7	and all peoples on earth “will mourn because of him.”
REV.1.7	So shall it be! Amen.
REV.1.8	“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”
REV.1.9	I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. 
REV.1.10	On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, 
REV.1.11	which said: 
REV.1.12	I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, 
REV.1.13	and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man,
REV.1.14	The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. 
REV.1.15	His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. 
REV.1.16	In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.
REV.1.17	When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: 
REV.4.1	After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, 
REV.4.2	At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. 
REV.4.3	And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne. 
REV.4.4	Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads. 
REV.4.5	From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits
REV.4.6	Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal.
REV.4.6	In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back. 
REV.4.7	The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle. 
REV.4.8	Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying:
REV.4.8	“ ‘Holy, holy, holy
REV.4.8	is the Lord God Almighty,’
REV.4.8	who was, and is, and is to come.”
REV.4.9	Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, 
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
REV.4.11	“You are worthy, our Lord and God,
REV.4.11	to receive glory and honor and power,
REV.4.11	for you created all things,
REV.4.11	and by your will they were created
REV.4.11	and have their being.”
REV.5.1	Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. 
REV.5.2	And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?” 
REV.5.3	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it. 
REV.5.4	I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. 
REV.5.5	Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”
REV.5.6	Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits
REV.5.7	He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne. 
REV.5.8	And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people. 
REV.5.9	And they sang a new song, saying:
REV.5.9	“You are worthy to take the scroll
REV.5.9	and to open its seals,
REV.5.9	because you were slain,
REV.5.9	and with your blood you purchased for God
REV.5.9	persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.
REV.5.10	You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God,
REV.5.10	and they will reign
REV.5.11	Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders. 
REV.5.12	In a loud voice they were saying:
REV.5.12	“Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain,
REV.5.12	to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength
REV.5.12	and honor and glory and praise!”
REV.5.13	Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying:
REV.5.13	“To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
REV.5.13	be praise and honor and glory and power,
REV.5.13	for ever and ever!”
REV.5.14	The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.
REV.6.1	I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!” 
REV.6.2	I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.
REV.6.3	When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!” 
REV.6.4	Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.
REV.6.5	When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. 
REV.6.6	Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, “Two pounds
REV.6.7	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” 
REV.6.8	I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
REV.6.9	When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. 
REV.6.10	They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” 
REV.6.11	Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters,
REV.6.12	I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, 
REV.6.13	and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind. 
REV.6.14	The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
REV.6.15	Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains. 
REV.6.16	They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us
REV.6.17	For the great day of their
REV.7.1	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree. 
REV.7.2	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea: 
REV.7.3	“Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.” 
REV.7.4	Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.
REV.7.5	From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed,
REV.7.5	from the tribe of Reuben 12,000,
REV.7.5	from the tribe of Gad 12,000,
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Asher 12,000,
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000,
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000,
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Simeon 12,000,
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Levi 12,000,
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Issachar 12,000,
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000,
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Joseph 12,000,
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000.
REV.7.9	After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. 
REV.7.10	And they cried out in a loud voice:
REV.7.10	“Salvation belongs to our God,
REV.7.10	who sits on the throne,
REV.7.10	and to the Lamb.”
REV.7.11	All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, 
REV.7.12	saying:
REV.7.12	“Amen!
REV.7.12	Praise and glory
REV.7.12	and wisdom and thanks and honor
REV.7.12	and power and strength
REV.7.12	be to our God for ever and ever.
REV.7.12	Amen!”
REV.7.13	Then one of the elders asked me, “These in white robes—who are they, and where did they come from?”
REV.7.14	I answered, “Sir, you know.”
REV.7.14	And he said, “These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
REV.7.15	Therefore,
REV.7.15	“they are before the throne of God
REV.7.15	and serve him day and night in his temple;
REV.7.15	and he who sits on the throne
REV.7.15	will shelter them with his presence.
REV.7.16	‘Never again will they hunger;
REV.7.16	never again will they thirst.
REV.7.16	The sun will not beat down on them,’
REV.7.16	nor any scorching heat.
REV.7.17	For the Lamb at the center of the throne
REV.7.17	will be their shepherd;
REV.7.17	‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’
REV.7.17	‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’
REV.8.1	When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
REV.8.2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
REV.8.3	Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all God’s people, on the golden altar in front of the throne. 
REV.8.4	The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God’s people, went up before God from the angel’s hand. 
REV.8.5	Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake.
REV.8.6	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
REV.8.7	The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
REV.8.8	The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, 
REV.8.9	a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.10	The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water— 
REV.8.11	the name of the star is Wormwood.
REV.8.12	The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.
REV.8.13	As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!”
REV.9.1	The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. 
REV.9.2	When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. 
REV.9.3	And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. 
REV.9.4	They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 
REV.9.5	They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes. 
REV.9.6	During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.
REV.9.7	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces. 
REV.9.8	Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. 
REV.9.9	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. 
REV.9.10	They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months. 
REV.9.11	They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer).
REV.9.12	The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.
REV.9.13	The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God. 
REV.9.14	It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” 
REV.9.15	And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind. 
REV.9.16	The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.
REV.9.17	The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur. 
REV.9.18	A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths. 
REV.9.19	The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury.
REV.9.20	The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk. 
REV.9.21	Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts.
REV.10.1	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs were like fiery pillars. 
REV.10.2	He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, 
REV.10.3	and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke. 
REV.10.4	And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down.”
REV.10.5	Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven. 
REV.10.6	And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and said, “There will be no more delay! 
REV.10.7	But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.”
REV.10.8	Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more: “Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”
REV.10.9	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but ‘in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.’
REV.10.10	I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour. 
REV.10.11	Then I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and kings.”
REV.11.1	I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers. 
REV.11.2	But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months. 
REV.11.3	And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” 
REV.11.4	They are “the two olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand before the Lord of the earth.”
REV.11.5	If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. 
REV.11.6	They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.
REV.11.7	Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them. 
REV.11.8	Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified. 
REV.11.9	For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial. 
REV.11.10	The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.
REV.11.11	But after the three and a half days the breath
REV.11.12	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.
REV.11.13	At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon.
REV.11.15	The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said:
REV.11.15	“The kingdom of the world has become
REV.11.15	the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah,
REV.11.15	and he will reign for ever and ever.”
REV.11.16	And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, 
REV.11.17	saying:
REV.11.17	“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,
REV.11.17	the One who is and who was,
REV.11.17	because you have taken your great power
REV.11.17	and have begun to reign.
REV.11.18	The nations were angry,
REV.11.18	and your wrath has come.
REV.11.18	The time has come for judging the dead,
REV.11.18	and for rewarding your servants the prophets
REV.11.18	and your people who revere your name,
REV.11.18	both great and small—
REV.11.18	and for destroying those who destroy the earth.”
REV.11.19	Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a severe hailstorm.
REV.12.1	A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 
REV.12.2	She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. 
REV.12.3	Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. 
REV.12.4	Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born. 
REV.12.5	She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.”
REV.12.6	The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.
REV.12.7	Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 
REV.12.8	But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. 
REV.12.9	The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.
REV.12.10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:
REV.12.10	“Now have come the salvation and the power
REV.12.10	and the kingdom of our God,
REV.12.10	and the authority of his Messiah.
REV.12.10	For the accuser of our brothers and sisters,
REV.12.10	who accuses them before our God day and night,
REV.12.10	has been hurled down.
REV.12.11	They triumphed over him
REV.12.11	by the blood of the Lamb
REV.12.11	and by the word of their testimony;
REV.12.11	they did not love their lives so much
REV.12.11	as to shrink from death.
REV.12.12	Therefore rejoice, you heavens
REV.12.12	and you who dwell in them!
REV.12.12	But woe to the earth and the sea,
REV.12.12	because the devil has gone down to you!
REV.12.12	He is filled with fury,
REV.12.12	because he knows that his time is short.”
REV.12.13	When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 
REV.12.14	The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. 
REV.12.15	Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. 
REV.12.16	But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. 
REV.12.17	Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.
REV.13.1	The dragon
REV.13.2	The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority. 
REV.13.3	One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast. 
REV.13.4	People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?”
REV.13.5	The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months. 
REV.13.6	It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven. 
REV.13.7	It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. 
REV.13.8	All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.
REV.13.9	Whoever has ears, let them hear.
REV.13.10	“If anyone is to go into captivity,
REV.13.10	into captivity they will go.
REV.13.10	If anyone is to be killed
REV.13.10	with the sword they will be killed.”
REV.13.10	This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people.
REV.13.11	Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. 
REV.13.12	It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. 
REV.13.13	And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. 
REV.13.14	Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. 
REV.13.15	The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 
REV.13.16	It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 
REV.13.17	so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
REV.13.18	This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.
REV.14.1	Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. 
REV.14.2	And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. 
REV.14.3	And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. 
REV.14.4	These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb. 
REV.14.5	No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.
REV.14.6	Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language and people. 
REV.14.7	He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water.”
REV.14.8	A second angel followed and said, “ ‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great,’
REV.14.9	A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand, 
REV.14.10	they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. 
REV.14.11	And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.” 
REV.14.12	This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep his commands and remain faithful to Jesus.
REV.14.13	Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.”
REV.14.13	“Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.”
REV.14.14	I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man
REV.14.15	Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.” 
REV.14.16	So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
REV.14.17	Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes are ripe.” 
REV.14.19	The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath. 
REV.14.20	They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.
REV.15.1	I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues—last, because with them God’s wrath is completed. 
REV.15.2	And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and over the number of its name. They held harps given them by God 
REV.15.3	and sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb:
REV.15.3	“Great and marvelous are your deeds,
REV.15.3	Lord God Almighty.
REV.15.3	Just and true are your ways,
REV.15.3	King of the nations.
REV.15.4	Who will not fear you, Lord,
REV.15.4	and bring glory to your name?
REV.15.4	For you alone are holy.
REV.15.4	All nations will come
REV.15.4	and worship before you,
REV.15.4	for your righteous acts have been revealed.”
REV.15.5	After this I looked, and I saw in heaven the temple—that is, the tabernacle of the covenant law—and it was opened. 
REV.15.6	Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests. 
REV.15.7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever. 
REV.15.8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
REV.16.1	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.”
REV.16.2	The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
REV.16.3	The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died.
REV.16.4	The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. 
REV.16.5	Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say:
REV.16.5	“You are just in these judgments, O Holy One,
REV.16.5	you who are and who were;
REV.16.6	for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets,
REV.16.6	and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.”
REV.16.7	And I heard the altar respond:
REV.16.7	“Yes, Lord God Almighty,
REV.16.7	true and just are your judgments.”
REV.16.8	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed to scorch people with fire. 
REV.16.9	They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.
REV.16.10	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony 
REV.16.11	and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done.
REV.16.12	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. 
REV.16.13	Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 
REV.16.14	They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.
REV.16.16	Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
REV.16.17	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is done!” 
REV.16.18	Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake. 
REV.16.19	The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath. 
REV.16.20	Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found. 
REV.16.21	From the sky huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds,
REV.17.1	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits by many waters. 
REV.17.2	With her the kings of the earth committed adultery, and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.”
REV.17.3	Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. 
REV.17.4	The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. 
REV.17.5	The name written on her forehead was a mystery:
REV.17.5	babylon the great
REV.17.5	the mother of prostitutes
REV.17.5	and of the abominations of the earth.
REV.17.6	I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus.
REV.17.6	When I saw her, I was greatly astonished. 
REV.17.7	Then the angel said to me: “Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns. 
REV.17.8	The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because it once was, now is not, and yet will come.
REV.17.9	“This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits. 
REV.17.10	They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while. 
REV.17.11	The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction.
REV.17.12	“The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. 
REV.17.13	They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. 
REV.17.14	They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.”
REV.17.15	Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. 
REV.17.16	The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. 
REV.17.17	For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their royal authority, until God’s words are fulfilled. 
REV.17.18	The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”
REV.18.1	After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. 
REV.18.2	With a mighty voice he shouted:
REV.18.2	“ ‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’
REV.18.2	She has become a dwelling for demons
REV.18.2	and a haunt for every impure spirit,
REV.18.2	a haunt for every unclean bird,
REV.18.2	a haunt for every unclean and detestable animal.
REV.18.3	For all the nations have drunk
REV.18.3	the maddening wine of her adulteries.
REV.18.3	The kings of the earth committed adultery with her,
REV.18.3	and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.”
REV.18.4	Then I heard another voice from heaven say:
REV.18.4	“ ‘Come out of her, my people,’
REV.18.4	so that you will not share in her sins,
REV.18.4	so that you will not receive any of her plagues;
REV.18.5	for her sins are piled up to heaven,
REV.18.5	and God has remembered her crimes.
REV.18.6	Give back to her as she has given;
REV.18.6	pay her back double for what she has done.
REV.18.6	Pour her a double portion from her own cup.
REV.18.7	Give her as much torment and grief
REV.18.7	as the glory and luxury she gave herself.
REV.18.7	In her heart she boasts,
REV.18.7	‘I sit enthroned as queen.
REV.18.7	I am not a widow;
REV.18.7	I will never mourn.’
REV.18.8	Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her:
REV.18.8	death, mourning and famine.
REV.18.8	She will be consumed by fire,
REV.18.8	for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.
REV.18.9	“When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her. 
REV.18.10	Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry:
REV.18.10	“ ‘Woe! Woe to you, great city,
REV.18.10	you mighty city of Babylon!
REV.18.10	In one hour your doom has come!’
REV.18.11	“The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes anymore— 
REV.18.12	cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble; 
REV.18.13	cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and human beings sold as slaves.
REV.18.14	“They will say, ‘The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your luxury and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.’ 
REV.18.15	The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn 
REV.18.16	and cry out:
REV.18.16	“ ‘Woe! Woe to you, great city,
REV.18.16	dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet,
REV.18.16	and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!
REV.18.17	In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’
REV.18.17	“Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off. 
REV.18.18	When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, ‘Was there ever a city like this great city?’ 
REV.18.19	They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out:
REV.18.19	“ ‘Woe! Woe to you, great city,
REV.18.19	where all who had ships on the sea
REV.18.19	became rich through her wealth!
REV.18.19	In one hour she has been brought to ruin!’
REV.18.20	“Rejoice over her, you heavens!
REV.18.20	Rejoice, you people of God!
REV.18.20	Rejoice, apostles and prophets!
REV.18.20	For God has judged her
REV.18.20	with the judgment she imposed on you.”
REV.18.21	Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said:
REV.18.21	“With such violence
REV.18.21	the great city of Babylon will be thrown down,
REV.18.21	never to be found again.
REV.18.22	The music of harpists and musicians, pipers and trumpeters,
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you again.
REV.18.22	No worker of any trade
REV.18.22	will ever be found in you again.
REV.18.22	The sound of a millstone
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you again.
REV.18.23	The light of a lamp
REV.18.23	will never shine in you again.
REV.18.23	The voice of bridegroom and bride
REV.18.23	will never be heard in you again.
REV.18.23	Your merchants were the world’s important people.
REV.18.23	By your magic spell all the nations were led astray.
REV.18.24	In her was found the blood of prophets and of God’s holy people,
REV.18.24	of all who have been slaughtered on the earth.”
REV.19.1	After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting:
REV.19.1	“Hallelujah!
REV.19.1	Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
REV.19.2	for true and just are his judgments.
REV.19.2	He has condemned the great prostitute
REV.19.2	who corrupted the earth by her adulteries.
REV.19.2	He has avenged on her the blood of his servants.”
REV.19.3	And again they shouted:
REV.19.3	“Hallelujah!
REV.19.3	The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.”
REV.19.4	The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried:
REV.19.4	“Amen, Hallelujah!”
REV.19.5	Then a voice came from the throne, saying:
REV.19.5	“Praise our God,
REV.19.5	all you his servants,
REV.19.5	you who fear him,
REV.19.5	both great and small!”
REV.19.6	Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting:
REV.19.6	“Hallelujah!
REV.19.6	For our Lord God Almighty reigns.
REV.19.7	Let us rejoice and be glad
REV.19.7	and give him glory!
REV.19.7	For the wedding of the Lamb has come,
REV.19.7	and his bride has made herself ready.
REV.19.8	Fine linen, bright and clean,
REV.19.8	was given her to wear.”
REV.19.8	(Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of God’s holy people.)
REV.19.9	Then the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!” And he added, “These are the true words of God.”
REV.19.10	At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus.”
REV.19.11	I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war. 
REV.19.12	His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself. 
REV.19.13	He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God. 
REV.19.14	The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean. 
REV.19.15	Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.”
REV.19.16	On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written:
REV.19.16	king of kings and lord of lords.
REV.19.17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God, 
REV.19.18	so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small.”
REV.19.19	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army. 
REV.19.20	But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. 
REV.19.21	The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
REV.20.1	And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain. 
REV.20.2	He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. 
REV.20.3	He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.
REV.20.4	I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They
REV.20.5	(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. 
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.
REV.20.7	When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison 
REV.20.8	and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore. 
REV.20.9	They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. 
REV.20.10	And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
REV.20.11	Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. 
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. 
REV.20.13	The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done. 
REV.20.14	Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. 
REV.20.15	Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
REV.21.1	Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,”
REV.21.2	I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. 
REV.21.3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. 
REV.21.4	‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’
REV.21.5	He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”
REV.21.6	He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. 
REV.21.7	Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children. 
REV.21.8	But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”
REV.21.9	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” 
REV.21.10	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. 
REV.21.11	It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. 
REV.21.12	It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
REV.21.13	There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west. 
REV.21.14	The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
REV.21.15	The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls. 
REV.21.16	The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia
REV.21.17	The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits
REV.21.18	The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. 
REV.21.19	The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, 
REV.21.20	the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.
REV.21.21	The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass.
REV.21.22	I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 
REV.21.23	The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. 
REV.21.24	The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. 
REV.21.25	On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. 
REV.21.26	The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. 
REV.21.27	Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
REV.22.1	Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 
REV.22.2	down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. 
REV.22.3	No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. 
REV.22.4	They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. 
REV.22.5	There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.
REV.22.6	The angel said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God who inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place.”
REV.22.8	I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me. 
REV.22.9	But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your fellow prophets and with all who keep the words of this scroll. Worship God!”
REV.22.10	Then he told me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is near. 
REV.22.11	Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person continue to be vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy person continue to be holy.”
REV.22.17	The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life.
REV.22.18	I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. 
REV.22.19	And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll.
REV.22.20	He who testifies to these things says, 
REV.22.20	Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
REV.22.21	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.
