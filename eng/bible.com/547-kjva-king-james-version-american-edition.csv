GEN.1.1	In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
GEN.1.2	And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness 
GEN.1.4	And God saw the light, that 
GEN.1.5	And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
GEN.1.7	And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which 
GEN.1.8	And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
GEN.1.9	And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry 
GEN.1.10	And God called the dry 
GEN.1.11	And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, 
GEN.1.12	And the earth brought forth grass, 
GEN.1.13	And the evening and the morning were the third day.
GEN.1.14	And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 
GEN.1.15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 
GEN.1.16	And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: 
GEN.1.17	And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 
GEN.1.18	and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that 
GEN.1.19	And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
GEN.1.20	And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl 
GEN.1.21	And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that 
GEN.1.22	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 
GEN.1.23	And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
GEN.1.24	And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 
GEN.1.25	And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that 
GEN.1.27	 So God created man in his 
GEN.1.28	And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
GEN.1.29	And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which 
GEN.1.30	And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein 
GEN.1.31	And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, 
GEN.2.1	Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 
GEN.2.2	 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 
GEN.2.3	And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
GEN.2.4	These 
GEN.2.5	and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the 
GEN.2.6	But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 
GEN.2.7	 And the 
GEN.2.8	And the 
GEN.2.9	 And out of the ground made the 
GEN.2.10	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

GEN.2.18	And the 
GEN.2.19	And out of the ground the 
GEN.2.20	And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him. 
GEN.2.21	And the 
GEN.2.22	And the rib, which the 
GEN.2.23	And Adam said, This 
GEN.2.24	 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 
GEN.2.25	And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
GEN.3.2	And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 
GEN.3.3	but of the fruit of the tree which 
GEN.3.4	And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 
GEN.3.5	for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 
GEN.3.6	And when the woman saw that the tree 
GEN.3.7	And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they

GEN.3.14	thou 
GEN.3.14	upon thy belly shalt thou go,
GEN.3.14	and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
GEN.3.15	and I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
GEN.3.15	and between thy seed and her seed;
GEN.3.15	it shall bruise thy head,
GEN.3.15	and thou shalt bruise his heel.
GEN.3.16	Unto the woman he said,
GEN.3.16	I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception;
GEN.3.16	in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children;
GEN.3.16	and thy desire 
GEN.3.16	and he shall rule over thee.
GEN.3.17	Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife,
GEN.3.17	and hast eaten of the tree,

GEN.3.23	therefore the 
GEN.3.24	So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
GEN.4.1	And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
GEN.4.2	And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 
GEN.4.3	And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the 
GEN.4.4	 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the 
GEN.4.5	but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 
GEN.4.6	And the 
GEN.4.7	If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door: and unto thee 
GEN.4.9	And the 
GEN.4.10	And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. 
GEN.4.11	And now 
GEN.4.12	When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 
GEN.4.13	And Cain said unto the 
GEN.4.14	Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass,

GEN.4.23	And Lamech said unto his wives,
GEN.4.23	Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
GEN.4.23	ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech:
GEN.4.23	for I have slain a man to my wounding,
GEN.4.23	and a young man to my hurt.
GEN.4.24	If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,
GEN.4.24	truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
GEN.4.25	And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth:
GEN.4.26	And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the

GEN.6.1	And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 
GEN.6.2	that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they 
GEN.6.3	And the 
GEN.6.4	 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare

GEN.6.11	The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence. 
GEN.6.12	And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. 
GEN.6.13	And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 
GEN.6.14	Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 
GEN.6.15	And this 
GEN.6.16	A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; 
GEN.6.17	And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein 
GEN.6.18	But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 
GEN.6.19	And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every 
GEN.6.20	Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind; two of every 
GEN.6.21	And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather 
GEN.6.22	 Thus did Noah according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
GEN.7.1	And the 
GEN.7.2	Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that 
GEN.7.3	Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 
GEN.7.4	For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. 
GEN.7.5	And Noah did according unto all that the 
GEN.7.6	And Noah 
GEN.7.7	 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 
GEN.7.8	Of clean beasts, and of beasts that 
GEN.7.9	there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
GEN.7.12	And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 
GEN.7.13	In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 
GEN.7.14	they, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 
GEN.7.15	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein 
GEN.7.16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the 
GEN.7.17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth. 
GEN.7.18	And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 
GEN.7.19	And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that 
GEN.7.20	Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 
GEN.7.21	And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 
GEN.7.22	all in whose nostrils 
GEN.7.23	And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained 
GEN.7.24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
GEN.8.1	And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that 
GEN.8.2	The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained. 
GEN.8.3	And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. 
GEN.8.4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ar´arat. 
GEN.8.5	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth 
GEN.8.6	And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 
GEN.8.7	and he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 
GEN.8.8	Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground. 
GEN.8.9	But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark; for the waters 
GEN.8.10	And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. 
GEN.8.11	And the dove came in to him in the evening, and, lo, in her mouth 
GEN.8.12	And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove, which returned not again unto him any more.
GEN.8.13	And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first 
GEN.8.14	And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. 
GEN.8.15	And God spake unto Noah, saying, 
GEN.8.16	Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. 
GEN.8.17	Bring forth with thee every living thing that 
GEN.8.18	And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 
GEN.8.19	every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, 
GEN.8.20	And Noah builded an altar unto the 
GEN.8.21	And the 
GEN.8.22	While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
GEN.9.2	And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth 
GEN.9.3	Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 
GEN.9.4	 But flesh with the life thereof, 
GEN.9.5	And surely your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. 
GEN.9.6	 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 
GEN.9.7	 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
GEN.9.8	And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 
GEN.9.9	And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that 
GEN.9.11	And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. 
GEN.9.12	And God said, This 
GEN.9.13	I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 
GEN.9.14	And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 
GEN.9.15	and I will remember my covenant, which 
GEN.9.16	And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that 
GEN.9.17	And God said unto Noah, This 
GEN.9.18	And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham 
GEN.9.19	These 
GEN.9.20	And Noah began 
GEN.9.21	and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 
GEN.9.22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 
GEN.9.23	And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid 
GEN.9.24	And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 
GEN.9.25	And he said,
GEN.9.25	Cursed 
GEN.9.25	a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
GEN.9.26	And he said,
GEN.9.26	Blessed 
GEN.9.26	and Canaan shall be his servant.
GEN.9.27	God shall enlarge Japheth,
GEN.9.27	and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
GEN.9.27	and Canaan shall be his servant.
GEN.9.28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 
GEN.9.29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
GEN.10.1	Now these 
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Ma´dai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
GEN.10.3	And the sons of Gomer; Ash´kenaz, and Riphath, and Togar´mah. 
GEN.10.4	And the sons of Javan; Eli´shah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Do´danim. 
GEN.10.5	By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
GEN.10.6	And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Miz´ra-im, and Phut, and Canaan. 
GEN.10.7	And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Hav´ilah, and Sabtah, and Ra´amah, and Sab´techa: and the sons of Ra´amah; Sheba, and Dedan. 
GEN.10.8	And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
GEN.10.9	He was a mighty hunter before the 
GEN.10.10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
GEN.10.11	Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nin´eveh, and the city Reho´both, and Calah, 
GEN.10.12	and Resen between Nin´eveh and Calah: the same 
GEN.10.13	And Miz´ra-im begat Ludim, and An´amim, and Le´habim, and Naph´tuhim, 
GEN.10.14	and Path´rusim, and Cas´luhim, (out of whom came Phil´istim,) and Caph´torim.
GEN.10.15	And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, 
GEN.10.16	and the Jeb´usite, and the Amorite, and the Gir´gashite, 
GEN.10.17	and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 
GEN.10.18	and the Ar´vadite, and the Zem´arite, and the Ha´mathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 
GEN.10.19	And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest unto Sodom, and Gomor´rah, and Admah, and Zebo´im, even unto Lasha. 
GEN.10.20	These 
GEN.10.21	Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were 
GEN.10.22	The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphax´ad, and Lud, and Aram. 
GEN.10.23	And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

GEN.10.29	and Ophir, and Hav´ilah, and Jobab: all these 
GEN.10.30	And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar, a mount of the east. 
GEN.10.31	These 
GEN.10.32	These 
GEN.11.1	And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. 
GEN.11.2	And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 
GEN.11.3	And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. 
GEN.11.4	And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top 
GEN.11.5	And the 
GEN.11.6	And the 
GEN.11.7	Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. 
GEN.11.8	So the 
GEN.11.9	Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the 
GEN.11.10	These 
GEN.11.11	and Shem lived after he begat Arphax´ad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

GEN.11.19	and Peleg lived after he begat Re´u two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	And Re´u lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 
GEN.11.21	and Re´u lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 
GEN.11.23	and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.24	And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 
GEN.11.25	and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	Now these 
GEN.11.28	And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. 
GEN.11.29	And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife 
GEN.11.30	But Sarai was barren; she 
GEN.11.31	And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 
GEN.11.32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
GEN.12.2	and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: 
GEN.12.3	 and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
GEN.12.4	So Abram departed, as the 
GEN.12.5	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. 
GEN.12.6	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite 
GEN.12.7	 And the 
GEN.12.8	And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth–el, and pitched his tent, 
GEN.12.9	And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
GEN.12.10	And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine 
GEN.12.11	And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou 
GEN.12.12	therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This 
GEN.12.13	 Say, I pray thee, thou 
GEN.12.14	And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she 
GEN.12.15	The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 
GEN.12.16	And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
GEN.12.17	And the 
GEN.12.18	And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What 
GEN.12.19	Why saidst thou, She 
GEN.12.20	And Pharaoh commanded 
GEN.13.1	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
GEN.13.2	And Abram 
GEN.13.3	And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ha´i; 
GEN.13.4	unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the 
GEN.13.5	And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 
GEN.13.6	And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. 
GEN.13.7	And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Per´izzite dwelt then in the land.
GEN.13.8	And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we 
GEN.13.9	 not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if 
GEN.13.10	 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it 
GEN.13.11	Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. 
GEN.13.12	Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched 
GEN.13.13	But the men of Sodom 
GEN.13.14	And the 
GEN.13.15	 for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. 
GEN.13.16	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, 
GEN.13.17	Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee. 
GEN.13.18	Then Abram removed 
GEN.14.1	And it came to pass in the days of Am´raphel king of Shinar, Ar´i-och king of Ella´sar, Chedorla-o´mer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations; 
GEN.14.2	 made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomor´rah, Shinab king of Admah, and Sheme´ber king of Zeboi´im, and the king of Bela, which is Zo´ar. 
GEN.14.3	All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. 
GEN.14.4	Twelve years they served Chedorla-o´mer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
GEN.14.5	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorla-o´mer, and the kings that 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in their mount Se´ir, unto El–pa´ran, which 
GEN.14.7	And they returned, and came to En–mish´pat, which 
GEN.14.8	And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomor´rah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboi´im, and the king of Bela, (the same 
GEN.14.9	with Chedorla-o´mer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Am´raphel king of Shinar, and Ar´i-och king of Ella´sar; four kings with five. 
GEN.14.10	And the vale of Siddim 
GEN.14.11	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomor´rah, and all their victuals, and went their way. 
GEN.14.12	And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
GEN.14.13	And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these 
GEN.14.14	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained 
GEN.14.15	And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which 
GEN.14.16	And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
GEN.14.17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorla-o´mer and of the kings that 
GEN.14.18	 And Melchiz´edek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he 
GEN.14.19	And he blessed him, and said,
GEN.14.19	Blessed be Abram of the most high God,
GEN.14.19	possessor of heaven and earth:
GEN.14.20	and blessed be the most high God,
GEN.14.20	which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.
GEN.14.20	And he gave him tithes of all. 
GEN.14.21	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. 
GEN.14.22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up mine hand unto the 
GEN.14.23	that I will not 
GEN.14.24	save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
GEN.15.1	After these things the word of the 
GEN.15.2	And Abram said, Lord 
GEN.15.3	And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 
GEN.15.4	And, behold, the word of the 
GEN.15.5	 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 
GEN.15.6	 And he believed in the 
GEN.15.7	And he said unto him, I 
GEN.15.8	And he said, Lord 
GEN.15.9	And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 
GEN.15.10	And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 
GEN.15.11	And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him. 
GEN.15.13	 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land 
GEN.15.14	 and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 
GEN.15.15	And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 
GEN.15.16	But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites 
GEN.15.17	And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. 
GEN.15.18	 In that same day the 
GEN.15.19	the Kenites, and the Ken´izzites, and the Kad´monites, 
GEN.15.20	and the Hittites, and the Per´izzites, and the Reph´a-im, 
GEN.15.21	and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Gir´gashites, and the Jeb´usites.
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name 
GEN.16.2	And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the 
GEN.16.3	And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. 
GEN.16.4	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. 
GEN.16.5	And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong 
GEN.16.6	But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid 
GEN.16.7	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.8	And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. 
GEN.16.9	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.10	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.11	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.12	And he will be a wild man; his hand 
GEN.16.13	And she called the name of the 
GEN.16.14	Wherefore the well was called Beer–la´hai–roi:
GEN.16.15	And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ish´ma-el. 
GEN.16.16	And Abram 
GEN.17.1	And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the 
GEN.17.2	And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. 
GEN.17.3	And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 
GEN.17.4	As for me, behold, my covenant 
GEN.17.5	 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham;
GEN.17.6	And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. 
GEN.17.7	 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee. 
GEN.17.8	 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
GEN.17.9	And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. 
GEN.17.10	 This 
GEN.17.11	And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. 
GEN.17.12	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which 
GEN.17.13	He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
GEN.17.14	And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
GEN.17.15	And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah
GEN.17.16	And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be 
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall 
GEN.17.18	And Abraham said unto God, O that Ish´ma-el might live before thee! 
GEN.17.19	And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, 
GEN.17.20	And as for Ish´ma-el, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
GEN.17.22	And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 
GEN.17.23	And Abraham took Ish´ma-el his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. 
GEN.17.24	And Abraham 
GEN.17.25	And Ish´ma-el his son 
GEN.17.26	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ish´ma-el his son. 
GEN.17.27	And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	And the 
GEN.18.2	and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw 
GEN.18.3	and said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 
GEN.18.4	let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: 
GEN.18.5	and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. 
GEN.18.6	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead 
GEN.18.7	And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave 
GEN.18.8	And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set 
GEN.18.9	And they said unto him, Where 
GEN.18.10	 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard 
GEN.18.11	Now Abraham and Sarah 
GEN.18.12	 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 
GEN.18.13	And the 
GEN.18.14	 Is any thing too hard for the 
GEN.18.15	Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
GEN.18.16	And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 
GEN.18.17	And the 
GEN.18.18	seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 
GEN.18.19	For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the 
GEN.18.20	And the 
GEN.18.21	I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
GEN.18.22	And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the 
GEN.18.23	And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 
GEN.18.24	Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that 
GEN.18.25	That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked; and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 
GEN.18.26	And the 
GEN.18.27	And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which 
GEN.18.28	Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for 
GEN.18.29	And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do 
GEN.18.30	And he said 
GEN.18.31	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy 
GEN.18.32	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy 
GEN.18.33	And the 
GEN.19.1	And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing 
GEN.19.2	and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. 
GEN.19.3	And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. 
GEN.19.4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, 
GEN.19.5	and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where 
GEN.19.6	And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, 
GEN.19.7	and said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 
GEN.19.8	Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as 
GEN.19.9	And they said, Stand back. And they said 
GEN.19.10	But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. 
GEN.19.11	And they smote the men that 
GEN.19.12	And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring 
GEN.19.13	for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the 
GEN.19.14	And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the 
GEN.19.15	And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 
GEN.19.16	 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the 
GEN.19.17	And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 
GEN.19.18	And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: 
GEN.19.19	behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 
GEN.19.20	behold now, this city 
GEN.19.21	And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. 
GEN.19.22	Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zo´ar.
GEN.19.23	The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zo´ar.
GEN.19.25	and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 
GEN.19.26	 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 
GEN.19.27	And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the 
GEN.19.28	and he looked toward Sodom and Gomor´rah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
GEN.19.29	And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
GEN.19.30	And Lot went up out of Zo´ar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zo´ar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
GEN.19.31	And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father 
GEN.19.32	come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
GEN.19.33	And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
GEN.19.34	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, 
GEN.19.35	And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
GEN.19.36	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
GEN.19.37	And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same 
GEN.19.38	And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben–am´mi: the same 
GEN.20.1	And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 
GEN.20.2	 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She 
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abim´elech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou 
GEN.20.4	But Abim´elech had not come near her: and he said, 
GEN.20.5	Said he not unto me, She 
GEN.20.6	And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 
GEN.20.7	Now therefore restore the man 
GEN.20.8	Therefore Abim´elech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abim´elech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 
GEN.20.10	And Abim´elech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 
GEN.20.11	And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God 
GEN.20.12	And yet indeed 
GEN.20.13	And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This 
GEN.20.14	And Abim´elech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave 
GEN.20.15	And Abim´elech said, Behold, my land 
GEN.20.16	And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand 
GEN.20.17	So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abim´elech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare 
GEN.20.18	For the 
GEN.21.1	And the 
GEN.21.2	 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
GEN.21.3	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 
GEN.21.4	 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. 
GEN.21.5	And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 
GEN.21.6	And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, 
GEN.21.7	And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have borne 
GEN.21.8	And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the 
GEN.21.9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Abraham, mocking. 
GEN.21.10	 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, 
GEN.21.11	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. 
GEN.21.12	 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. 
GEN.21.13	And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he 
GEN.21.14	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave 
GEN.21.15	And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 
GEN.21.16	And she went, and sat her down over against 
GEN.21.17	And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he 
GEN.21.18	Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 
GEN.21.19	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 
GEN.21.20	And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 
GEN.21.21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.23	now therefore swear unto me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: 
GEN.21.24	And Abraham said, I will swear.
GEN.21.25	And Abraham reproved Abim´elech because of a well of water, which Abim´elech's servants had violently taken away. 
GEN.21.26	And Abim´elech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I 
GEN.21.27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abim´elech; and both of them made a covenant. 
GEN.21.28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
GEN.21.29	And Abim´elech said unto Abraham, What 
GEN.21.30	And he said, For 
GEN.21.31	Wherefore he called that place Beer–sheba;
GEN.21.32	Thus they made a covenant at Beer–sheba: then Abim´elech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	And 
GEN.21.34	And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
GEN.22.2	And he said, Take now thy son, thine only 
GEN.22.3	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 
GEN.22.4	Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 
GEN.22.5	And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. 
GEN.22.6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid 
GEN.22.7	And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here 
GEN.22.8	And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
GEN.22.10	And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 
GEN.22.11	And the angel of the 
GEN.22.12	And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only 
GEN.22.13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind 
GEN.22.14	And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–ji´reh: as it is said 
GEN.22.15	And the angel of the 
GEN.22.16	 and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the 
GEN.22.17	 that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which 
GEN.22.18	 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. 
GEN.22.19	So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba.
GEN.22.20	And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children unto thy brother Nahor; 
GEN.22.21	Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kem´uel the father of Aram, 
GEN.22.22	and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethu´el. 
GEN.22.23	And Bethu´el begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
GEN.22.24	And his concubine, whose name 
GEN.23.1	And Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old: 
GEN.23.2	And Sarah died in Kir´jath–ar´ba; the same 
GEN.23.3	And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 
GEN.23.4	 I 
GEN.23.5	And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
GEN.23.6	Hear us, my lord: thou 
GEN.23.7	And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, 
GEN.23.8	And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 
GEN.23.9	that he may give me the cave of Machpe´lah, which he hath, which 
GEN.23.10	And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, 
GEN.23.11	Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that 
GEN.23.12	And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. 
GEN.23.13	And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou 
GEN.23.14	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
GEN.23.15	My lord, hearken unto me: the land 
GEN.23.16	And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current 
GEN.23.17	And the field of Ephron, which 
GEN.23.18	unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 
GEN.23.19	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpe´lah before Mamre: the same 
GEN.23.20	And the field, and the cave that 
GEN.24.1	And Abraham was old, 
GEN.24.2	And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 
GEN.24.3	and I will make thee swear by the 
GEN.24.4	but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. 
GEN.24.5	And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? 
GEN.24.6	And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. 
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. 
GEN.24.9	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.
GEN.24.10	And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master 
GEN.24.11	And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, 
GEN.24.12	And he said, O 
GEN.24.13	Behold, I stand 
GEN.24.14	and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: 
GEN.24.15	And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethu´el, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. 
GEN.24.16	And the damsel 
GEN.24.17	And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. 
GEN.24.18	And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. 
GEN.24.19	And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw 
GEN.24.20	And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw 
GEN.24.21	And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the 
GEN.24.22	And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten 
GEN.24.23	and said, Whose daughter 
GEN.24.24	And she said unto him, I 
GEN.24.25	She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. 
GEN.24.26	And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the 
GEN.24.27	And he said, Blessed 
GEN.24.28	And the damsel ran, and told 
GEN.24.29	And Rebekah had a brother, and his name 
GEN.24.30	And it came to pass, when he saw the earring, and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me, that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. 
GEN.24.31	And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the 
GEN.24.32	And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that 
GEN.24.33	And there was set 
GEN.24.34	And he said, I 
GEN.24.35	And the 
GEN.24.36	And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 
GEN.24.37	And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 
GEN.24.38	but thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. 
GEN.24.39	And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. 
GEN.24.40	And he said unto me, The 
GEN.24.41	then shalt thou be clear from 
GEN.24.42	And I came this day unto the well, and said, O 
GEN.24.43	behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw 
GEN.24.44	and she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: 
GEN.24.45	And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew 
GEN.24.46	And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her 
GEN.24.47	And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter 
GEN.24.48	And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the 
GEN.24.49	And now, if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethu´el answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the 
GEN.24.51	Behold, Rebekah 
GEN.24.52	And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the 
GEN.24.53	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave 
GEN.24.54	And they did eat and drink, he and the men that 
GEN.24.55	And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us 
GEN.24.56	And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the 
GEN.24.57	And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth. 
GEN.24.58	And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. 
GEN.24.59	And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. 
GEN.24.60	And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou 
GEN.24.61	And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
GEN.24.62	And Isaac came from the way of the well La´hai–roi; for he dwelt in the south country. 
GEN.24.63	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels 
GEN.24.64	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. 
GEN.24.65	For she 
GEN.24.66	And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. 
GEN.24.67	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's 
GEN.25.1	Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name 
GEN.25.2	And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Mid´i-an, and Ishbak, and Shu´ah. 
GEN.25.3	And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were As´shurim, and Let´ushim, and Le´ummim. 
GEN.25.4	And the sons of Mid´i-an; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abi´dah, and Elda´ah. All these 
GEN.25.5	And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 
GEN.25.6	But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
GEN.25.7	And these 
GEN.25.8	Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full 
GEN.25.9	And his sons Isaac and Ish´ma-el buried him in the cave of Machpe´lah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which 
GEN.25.10	 the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 
GEN.25.11	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well La´hai–roi.
GEN.25.12	Now these 
GEN.25.13	and these 
GEN.25.14	and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Ked´emah: 
GEN.25.16	these 
GEN.25.17	And these 
GEN.25.18	And they dwelt from Hav´ilah unto Shur, that 
GEN.25.19	And these 
GEN.25.20	and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethu´el the Syrian of Pa´dan–a´ram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 
GEN.25.21	And Isaac entreated the 
GEN.25.22	And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If 
GEN.25.23	 And the 
GEN.25.23	Two nations 
GEN.25.23	and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels;
GEN.25.23	and 
GEN.25.23	and the elder shall serve the younger.
GEN.25.24	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, 
GEN.25.25	And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 
GEN.25.26	And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac 
GEN.25.27	And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob 
GEN.25.28	And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of 
GEN.25.29	And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he 
GEN.25.30	and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red 
GEN.25.31	And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 
GEN.25.32	And Esau said, Behold, I 
GEN.25.33	 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. Thus Esau despised 
GEN.26.1	And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abim´elech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 
GEN.26.2	And the 
GEN.26.3	 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 
GEN.26.4	and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: 
GEN.26.5	because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
GEN.26.6	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. 
GEN.26.7	 And the men of the place asked 
GEN.26.8	And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abim´elech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac 
GEN.26.9	And Abim´elech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she 
GEN.26.10	And Abim´elech said, What 
GEN.26.11	And Abim´elech charged all 
GEN.26.12	Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold: and the 
GEN.26.13	And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: 
GEN.26.14	for he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. 
GEN.26.15	For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 
GEN.26.16	And Abim´elech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
GEN.26.17	And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
GEN.26.18	And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 
GEN.26.19	And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 
GEN.26.20	And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water 
GEN.26.21	And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
GEN.26.22	And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Reho´both;
GEN.26.23	And he went up from thence to Beer–sheba. 
GEN.26.24	And the 
GEN.26.25	And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the 
GEN.26.27	And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 
GEN.26.28	And they said, We saw certainly that the 
GEN.26.29	that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou 
GEN.26.30	And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 
GEN.26.31	And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
GEN.26.32	And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 
GEN.26.33	And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city 
GEN.26.34	And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Be-e´ri the Hittite, and Bash´emath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 
GEN.26.35	which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
GEN.27.1	And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, 
GEN.27.2	And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: 
GEN.27.3	now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me 
GEN.27.4	and make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring 
GEN.27.5	And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt 
GEN.27.6	And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 
GEN.27.7	Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the 
GEN.27.8	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee. 
GEN.27.9	Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 
GEN.27.10	and thou shalt bring 
GEN.27.11	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother 
GEN.27.12	my father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. 
GEN.27.13	And his mother said unto him, Upon me 
GEN.27.14	And he went, and fetched, and brought 
GEN.27.15	And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which 
GEN.27.16	and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: 
GEN.27.17	and she gave the savory meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
GEN.27.18	And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here 
GEN.27.19	And Jacob said unto his father, I 
GEN.27.20	And Isaac said unto his son, How 
GEN.27.21	And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou 
GEN.27.22	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice 
GEN.27.23	And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	And he said, 
GEN.27.25	And he said, Bring 
GEN.27.26	And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. 
GEN.27.27	 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said,
GEN.27.27	See, the smell of my son
GEN.27.28	therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven,
GEN.27.28	and the fatness of the earth,
GEN.27.28	and plenty of corn and wine:
GEN.27.29	and nations bow down to thee:
GEN.27.29	be lord over thy brethren,
GEN.27.29	and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:
GEN.27.29	cursed 
GEN.27.29	and blessed 
GEN.27.30	And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
GEN.27.31	And he also had made savory meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
GEN.27.32	And Isaac his father said unto him, Who 
GEN.27.33	And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where 
GEN.27.34	And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, 
GEN.27.35	And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. 
GEN.27.36	 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? 
GEN.27.37	And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? 
GEN.27.38	 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, 
GEN.27.39	Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth,
GEN.27.39	and of the dew of heaven from above;
GEN.27.40	and shalt serve thy brother:
GEN.27.40	and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,
GEN.27.40	that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
GEN.27.41	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 
GEN.27.42	And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, 
GEN.27.43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 
GEN.27.44	and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 
GEN.27.45	until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget 
GEN.27.46	And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these 
GEN.28.1	And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to Pa´dan–a´ram, to the house of Bethu´el thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother. 
GEN.28.3	And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 
GEN.28.4	 and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. 
GEN.28.5	And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Pa´dan–a´ram unto Laban, son of Bethu´el the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
GEN.28.6	When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Pa´dan–a´ram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; 
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Pa´dan–a´ram; 
GEN.28.8	and Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 
GEN.28.9	then went Esau unto Ish´ma-el, and took unto the wives which he had Ma´halath the daughter of Ish´ma-el Abraham's son, the sister of Neba´joth, to be his wife.
GEN.28.10	And Jacob went out from Beer–sheba, and went toward Haran. 
GEN.28.11	And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put 
GEN.28.12	 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
GEN.28.13	 And, behold, the 
GEN.28.14	 and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 
GEN.28.15	And, behold, I 
GEN.28.16	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the 
GEN.28.17	And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful 
GEN.28.18	And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put 
GEN.28.19	And he called the name of that place Beth–el:
GEN.28.20	And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 
GEN.28.21	so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the 
GEN.28.22	and this stone, which I have set 
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. 
GEN.29.2	And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there 
GEN.29.3	And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.
GEN.29.4	And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence 
GEN.29.5	And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know 
GEN.29.6	And he said unto them, 
GEN.29.7	And he said, Lo, 
GEN.29.8	And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and 
GEN.29.9	And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them. 
GEN.29.10	And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 
GEN.29.11	And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 
GEN.29.12	And Jacob told Rachel that he 
GEN.29.13	And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. 
GEN.29.14	And Laban said to him, Surely thou 
GEN.29.15	And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou 
GEN.29.16	And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder 
GEN.29.17	Le´ah 
GEN.29.18	And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. 
GEN.29.19	And Laban said, 
GEN.29.20	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him 
GEN.29.21	And Jacob said unto Laban, Give 
GEN.29.22	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 
GEN.29.23	And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Le´ah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. 
GEN.29.24	And Laban gave unto his daughter Le´ah Zilpah his maid 
GEN.29.25	And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it 
GEN.29.26	And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. 
GEN.29.27	Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 
GEN.29.28	And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. 
GEN.29.29	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. 
GEN.29.30	And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Le´ah, and served with him yet seven other years.
GEN.29.31	And when the 
GEN.29.32	And Le´ah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Reuben:
GEN.29.33	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the 
GEN.29.34	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
GEN.29.35	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she said, Now will I praise the 
GEN.30.1	And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. 
GEN.30.2	And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, 
GEN.30.3	And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. 
GEN.30.4	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her. 
GEN.30.5	And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.6	And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
GEN.30.7	And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naph´tali.
GEN.30.9	When Le´ah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 
GEN.30.10	And Zilpah Le´ah's maid bare Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.11	And Le´ah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad. 
GEN.30.12	And Zilpah Le´ah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.13	And Le´ah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.
GEN.30.14	And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Le´ah. Then Rachel said to Le´ah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. 
GEN.30.15	And she said unto her, 
GEN.30.16	And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Le´ah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 
GEN.30.17	And God hearkened unto Le´ah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. 
GEN.30.18	And Le´ah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Is´sachar.
GEN.30.19	And Le´ah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. 
GEN.30.20	And Le´ah said, God hath endued me 
GEN.30.21	And afterward she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. 
GEN.30.22	And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. 
GEN.30.23	And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 
GEN.30.24	and she called his name Joseph;
GEN.30.25	And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. 
GEN.30.26	Give 
GEN.30.27	And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, 
GEN.30.28	And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give 
GEN.30.29	And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. 
GEN.30.30	For 
GEN.30.31	And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed 
GEN.30.32	I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and 
GEN.30.33	So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that 
GEN.30.34	And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. 
GEN.30.35	And he removed that day the he goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, 
GEN.30.36	And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
GEN.30.37	And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and pilled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which 
GEN.30.38	And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. 
GEN.30.39	And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
GEN.30.40	And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. 
GEN.30.41	And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. 
GEN.30.42	But when the cattle were feeble, he put 
GEN.30.43	And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.
GEN.31.1	And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that 
GEN.31.2	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it 
GEN.31.3	And the 
GEN.31.4	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Le´ah to the field unto his flock, 
GEN.31.5	and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it 
GEN.31.6	And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 
GEN.31.7	And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. 
GEN.31.8	If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ring-streaked. 
GEN.31.9	Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given 
GEN.31.10	And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle 
GEN.31.11	And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, 
GEN.31.12	And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle 
GEN.31.13	 I 
GEN.31.14	And Rachel and Le´ah answered and said unto him, 
GEN.31.15	Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. 
GEN.31.16	For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that 
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; 
GEN.31.18	and he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Pa´dan–a´ram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.31.19	And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that 
GEN.31.20	And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. 
GEN.31.21	So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face 
GEN.31.22	And it was told Laban on the third day, that Jacob was fled. 
GEN.31.23	And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gil´e-ad. 
GEN.31.24	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
GEN.31.25	Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gil´e-ad. 
GEN.31.26	And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives 
GEN.31.27	Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? 
GEN.31.28	And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in 
GEN.31.29	It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 
GEN.31.30	And now, 
GEN.31.31	And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. 
GEN.31.32	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what 
GEN.31.33	And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Le´ah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found 
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found 
GEN.31.35	And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women 
GEN.31.36	And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What 
GEN.31.37	Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set 
GEN.31.38	This twenty years 
GEN.31.39	That which was torn 
GEN.31.40	 I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. 
GEN.31.41	Thus have I been twenty years in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle; and thou hast changed my wages ten times. 
GEN.31.42	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked 
GEN.31.43	And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, 
GEN.31.44	Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee. 
GEN.31.45	And Jacob took a stone, and set it up 
GEN.31.46	And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 
GEN.31.47	And Laban called it Je´gar–sahadu´tha:
GEN.31.48	And Laban said, This heap 
GEN.31.49	and Mizpah;
GEN.31.50	If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take 
GEN.31.51	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold 
GEN.31.52	this heap 
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. 
GEN.31.54	Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
GEN.31.55	And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
GEN.32.1	And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
GEN.32.2	And when Jacob saw them, he said, This 
GEN.32.3	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Se´ir, the country of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: 
GEN.32.5	and I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
GEN.32.6	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. 
GEN.32.7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that 
GEN.32.8	and said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
GEN.32.9	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the 
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 
GEN.32.11	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, 
GEN.32.12	 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
GEN.32.13	And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 
GEN.32.14	two hundred she goats and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she asses and ten foals. 
GEN.32.16	And he delivered 
GEN.32.17	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose 
GEN.32.18	Then thou shalt say, 
GEN.32.19	And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. 
GEN.32.20	And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob 
GEN.32.21	So went the present over before him; and himself lodged that night in the company.
GEN.32.22	And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. 
GEN.32.23	And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. 
GEN.32.24	And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 
GEN.32.25	And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. 
GEN.32.26	And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. 
GEN.32.27	And he said unto him, What 
GEN.32.28	 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 
GEN.32.29	And Jacob asked 
GEN.32.30	And Jacob called the name of the place Peni´el:
GEN.32.31	And as he passed over Penu´el the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 
GEN.32.32	Therefore the children of Israel eat not 
GEN.33.1	And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Le´ah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 
GEN.33.2	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Le´ah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 
GEN.33.3	And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
GEN.33.4	And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 
GEN.33.5	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who 
GEN.33.6	Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 
GEN.33.7	And Le´ah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 
GEN.33.8	And he said, What 
GEN.33.9	And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. 
GEN.33.10	And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. 
GEN.33.11	Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took 
GEN.33.12	And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. 
GEN.33.13	And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children 
GEN.33.14	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant; and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Se´ir.
GEN.33.15	And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee 
GEN.33.16	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Se´ir. 
GEN.33.17	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
GEN.33.18	And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which 
GEN.33.19	 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money. 
GEN.33.20	And he erected there an altar, and called it El–El´ohe–Israel.
GEN.34.1	And Dinah the daughter of Le´ah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 
GEN.34.2	And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. 
GEN.34.3	And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 
GEN.34.4	And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. 
GEN.34.5	And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. 
GEN.34.6	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. 
GEN.34.7	And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard 
GEN.34.8	And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 
GEN.34.9	And make ye marriages with us, 
GEN.34.10	And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 
GEN.34.11	And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. 
GEN.34.12	Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
GEN.34.13	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: 
GEN.34.14	and they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that 
GEN.34.15	but in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we 
GEN.34.16	then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 
GEN.34.17	But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
GEN.34.18	And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem Hamor's son. 
GEN.34.19	And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he 
GEN.34.20	And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 
GEN.34.21	These men 
GEN.34.22	Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they 
GEN.34.23	 not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs 
GEN.34.24	And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
GEN.34.25	And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. 
GEN.34.26	And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. 
GEN.34.27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
GEN.34.28	They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which 
GEN.34.29	and all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that 
GEN.34.30	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Per´izzites: and I 
GEN.34.31	And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?
GEN.35.2	Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that 
GEN.35.3	and let us arise, and go up to Beth–el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. 
GEN.35.4	And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which 
GEN.35.5	And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that 
GEN.35.6	So Jacob came to Luz which 
GEN.35.7	And he built there an altar, and called the place El–beth´–el;
GEN.35.8	But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Beth–el under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon–bach´uth.
GEN.35.9	And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Pa´dan–a´ram, and blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	 And God said unto him, Thy name 
GEN.35.11	 And God said unto him, I 
GEN.35.12	and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 
GEN.35.13	And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 
GEN.35.14	 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, 
GEN.35.15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth–el.
GEN.35.17	And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. 
GEN.35.18	And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died,) that she called his name Beno´ni:
GEN.35.19	And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which 
GEN.35.20	And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that 
GEN.35.21	And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
GEN.35.22	And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard 
GEN.35.22	Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
GEN.35.23	the sons of Le´ah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Is´sachar, and Zeb´ulun: 
GEN.35.24	the sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 
GEN.35.25	and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naph´tali: 
GEN.35.26	and the sons of Zilpah, Le´ah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher. These 
GEN.35.28	And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years. 
GEN.35.29	And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, 
GEN.36.1	Now these 
GEN.36.2	 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholiba´mah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zib´e-on the Hivite;

GEN.36.6	And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle. 
GEN.36.8	Thus dwelt Esau in mount Se´ir: Esau 
GEN.36.9	And these 
GEN.36.10	these 
GEN.36.11	And the sons of El´iphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.

GEN.36.23	And the children of Shobal

GEN.36.34	And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Te´mani reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.35	And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Mid´i-an in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city 
GEN.36.36	And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masre´kah reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.37	And Samlah died, and Saul of Reho´both 
GEN.36.38	And Saul died, and Ba´al–ha´nan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.

GEN.37.1	And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.37.2	These 
GEN.37.2	Joseph, 
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he 
GEN.37.4	And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
GEN.37.5	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told 
GEN.37.6	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 
GEN.37.7	for, behold, we 
GEN.37.8	And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 
GEN.37.9	And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 
GEN.37.10	And he told 
GEN.37.11	 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
GEN.37.12	And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed 
GEN.37.14	And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
GEN.37.15	And a certain man found him, and, behold, 
GEN.37.16	And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed 
GEN.37.17	And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 
GEN.37.18	And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. 
GEN.37.19	And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. 
GEN.37.20	Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams. 
GEN.37.21	And Reuben heard 
GEN.37.22	And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, 
GEN.37.23	And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, 
GEN.37.24	and they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit 
GEN.37.25	And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ish´maelites came from Gil´e-ad, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry 
GEN.37.26	And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit 
GEN.37.27	Come, and let us sell him to the Ish´maelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he 
GEN.37.28	 Then there passed by Mid´i-anites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ish´maelites for twenty 
GEN.37.29	And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph 
GEN.37.30	And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child 
GEN.37.31	And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 
GEN.37.32	and they sent the coat of 
GEN.37.33	And he knew it, and said, 
GEN.37.34	And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 
GEN.37.35	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. 
GEN.37.36	And the Mid´i-anites sold him into Egypt unto Pot´iphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, 
GEN.38.1	And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adul´lamite, whose name 
GEN.38.2	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name 
GEN.38.3	And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. 
GEN.38.4	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. 
GEN.38.5	And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 
GEN.38.6	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name 
GEN.38.7	And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the 
GEN.38.8	And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 
GEN.38.9	And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled 
GEN.38.10	And the thing which he did displeased the 
GEN.38.11	Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren 
GEN.38.12	And in process of time the daughter of Shu´ah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adul´lamite. 
GEN.38.13	And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. 
GEN.38.14	And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which 
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought her 
GEN.38.16	And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she 
GEN.38.17	And he said, I will send 
GEN.38.18	And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that 
GEN.38.19	And she arose, and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
GEN.38.20	And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adul´lamite, to receive 
GEN.38.21	Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where 
GEN.38.22	And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, 
GEN.38.23	And Judah said, Let her take 
GEN.38.24	And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she 
GEN.38.25	When she 
GEN.38.26	And Judah acknowledged 
GEN.38.27	And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins 
GEN.38.28	And it came to pass, when she travailed, that 
GEN.38.29	And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? 
GEN.38.30	And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
GEN.39.1	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Pot´iphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ish´maelites, which had brought him down thither. 
GEN.39.2	 And the 
GEN.39.3	And his master saw that the 
GEN.39.4	And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all 
GEN.39.5	And it came to pass from the time 
GEN.39.6	And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught he had, save the bread which he did eat.
GEN.39.6	And Joseph was a goodly person, and well-favored. 
GEN.39.7	And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 
GEN.39.8	But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what 
GEN.39.9	 none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou 
GEN.39.10	And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, 
GEN.39.11	And it came to pass about this time, that 
GEN.39.12	And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 
GEN.39.13	And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 
GEN.39.14	that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 
GEN.39.15	and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. 
GEN.39.16	And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. 
GEN.39.17	And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: 
GEN.39.18	and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.
GEN.39.19	And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. 
GEN.39.20	And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners 
GEN.39.21	 But the 
GEN.39.22	And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that 
GEN.39.23	The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing 
GEN.40.1	And it came to pass after these things, 
GEN.40.2	And Pharaoh was wroth against two 
GEN.40.3	And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph 
GEN.40.4	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward. 
GEN.40.5	And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which 
GEN.40.6	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they 
GEN.40.7	And he asked Pharaoh's officers that 
GEN.40.8	And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and 
GEN.40.9	And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine 
GEN.40.10	and in the vine 
GEN.40.11	and Pharaoh's cup 
GEN.40.12	And Joseph said unto him, This 
GEN.40.13	yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place; and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. 
GEN.40.14	But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 
GEN.40.15	for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also 
GEN.40.17	and in the uppermost basket 
GEN.40.18	And Joseph answered and said, This 
GEN.40.19	yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
GEN.40.20	And it came to pass the third day, 
GEN.40.21	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 
GEN.40.22	but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
GEN.40.23	Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
GEN.41.1	And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 
GEN.41.2	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored kine and fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 
GEN.41.3	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed; and stood by the 
GEN.41.4	And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
GEN.41.5	And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 
GEN.41.6	And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 
GEN.41.7	And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, 
GEN.41.8	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but 
GEN.41.9	Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, 
GEN.41.11	and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 
GEN.41.12	And 
GEN.41.13	And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved 
GEN.41.15	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and 
GEN.41.16	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, 
GEN.41.17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 
GEN.41.18	and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow: 
GEN.41.19	and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 
GEN.41.20	and the lean and the ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 
GEN.41.21	and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they 
GEN.41.22	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 
GEN.41.23	and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, 
GEN.41.24	and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told 
GEN.41.25	And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh 
GEN.41.26	The seven good kine 
GEN.41.27	And the seven thin and ill-favored kine that came up after them 
GEN.41.28	This 
GEN.41.29	Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 
GEN.41.30	and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 
GEN.41.31	and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it 
GEN.41.32	And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; 
GEN.41.33	Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh do 
GEN.41.35	And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 
GEN.41.36	And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
GEN.41.37	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 
GEN.41.38	And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find 
GEN.41.39	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all this, 
GEN.41.40	 thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. 
GEN.41.41	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.42	And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 
GEN.41.43	and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him 
GEN.41.44	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I 
GEN.41.45	And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaph´nath–paane´ah; and he gave him to wife As´enath the daughter of Potiphe´rah priest of On. And Joseph went out over 
GEN.41.46	And Joseph 
GEN.41.47	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 
GEN.41.48	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which 
GEN.41.49	And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for 
GEN.41.50	And unto Joseph were born two sons, before the years of famine came: which As´enath the daughter of Potiphe´rah priest of On bare unto him. 
GEN.41.51	And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manas´seh:
GEN.41.52	And the name of the second called he E´phra-im:
GEN.41.53	And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. 
GEN.41.54	 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
GEN.41.55	 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 
GEN.41.56	And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.57	And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy 
GEN.42.1	Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 
GEN.42.2	 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. 
GEN.42.3	And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 
GEN.42.5	And the sons of Israel came to buy 
GEN.42.6	And Joseph 
GEN.42.7	And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. 
GEN.42.8	And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 
GEN.42.9	 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye 
GEN.42.10	And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 
GEN.42.11	We 
GEN.42.12	And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 
GEN.42.13	And they said, Thy servants 
GEN.42.14	And Joseph said unto them, That 
GEN.42.15	hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 
GEN.42.16	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether 
GEN.42.17	And he put them all together into ward three days.
GEN.42.18	And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; 
GEN.42.19	if ye 
GEN.42.20	but bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. 
GEN.42.21	And they said one to another. We 
GEN.42.22	 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. 
GEN.42.23	And they knew not that Joseph understood 
GEN.42.24	And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. 
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
GEN.42.26	And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. 
GEN.42.27	And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it 
GEN.42.28	And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, 
GEN.42.29	And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 
GEN.42.30	The man, 
GEN.42.31	And we said unto him, We 
GEN.42.32	we 
GEN.42.33	And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye 
GEN.42.34	and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye 
GEN.42.35	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money 
GEN.42.36	And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved 
GEN.42.37	And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. 
GEN.42.38	And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
GEN.43.1	And the famine 
GEN.43.2	And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. 
GEN.43.3	And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother 
GEN.43.4	If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: 
GEN.43.5	but if thou wilt not send 
GEN.43.6	And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye 
GEN.43.7	And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, 
GEN.43.8	And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, 
GEN.43.9	I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 
GEN.43.10	for except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
GEN.43.11	And their father Israel said unto them, If 
GEN.43.12	and take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry 
GEN.43.13	Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 
GEN.43.14	and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved 
GEN.43.15	And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
GEN.43.16	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring 
GEN.43.17	And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 
GEN.43.18	And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. 
GEN.43.19	And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, 
GEN.43.20	and said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 
GEN.43.21	and it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, 
GEN.43.22	And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. 
GEN.43.23	And he said, Peace 
GEN.43.24	And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave 
GEN.43.25	And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
GEN.43.26	And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which 
GEN.43.27	And he asked them of 
GEN.43.28	And they answered, Thy servant our father 
GEN.43.29	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, 
GEN.43.30	And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought 
GEN.43.31	And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. 
GEN.43.32	And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that 
GEN.43.33	And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another. 
GEN.43.34	And he took 
GEN.44.1	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks 
GEN.44.2	And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
GEN.44.3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 
GEN.44.4	 when they were gone out of the city, 
GEN.44.5	 not this 
GEN.44.6	And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. 
GEN.44.7	And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 
GEN.44.8	behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? 
GEN.44.9	With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. 
GEN.44.10	And he said, Now also 
GEN.44.11	Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 
GEN.44.12	And he searched, 
GEN.44.13	Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he 
GEN.44.15	And Joseph said unto them, What deed 
GEN.44.16	And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we 
GEN.44.17	And he said, God forbid that I should do so: 
GEN.44.18	Then Judah came near unto him, and said, O my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou 
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 
GEN.44.20	And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 
GEN.44.21	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 
GEN.44.22	And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for 
GEN.44.23	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 
GEN.44.24	And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 
GEN.44.25	And our father said, Go again, 
GEN.44.26	And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother 
GEN.44.27	And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two 
GEN.44.28	and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 
GEN.44.29	and if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 
GEN.44.30	Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad 
GEN.44.31	it shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad 
GEN.44.32	For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. 
GEN.44.33	Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 
GEN.44.34	For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad 
GEN.45.2	And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. 
GEN.45.3	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I 
GEN.45.4	And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I 
GEN.45.5	Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. 
GEN.45.6	For these two years 
GEN.45.7	And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 
GEN.45.8	So now 
GEN.45.9	 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: 
GEN.45.10	and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 
GEN.45.11	and there will I nourish thee; for yet 
GEN.45.12	And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that 
GEN.45.13	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. 
GEN.45.14	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 
GEN.45.15	Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
GEN.45.16	And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. 
GEN.45.17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 
GEN.45.18	and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. 
GEN.45.19	Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. 
GEN.45.20	Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt 
GEN.45.21	And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 
GEN.45.22	To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred 
GEN.45.23	And to his father he sent after this 
GEN.45.24	So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. 
GEN.45.25	And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, 
GEN.45.26	and told him, saying, Joseph 
GEN.45.27	And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived. 
GEN.45.28	And Israel said, 
GEN.46.1	And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer–sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 
GEN.46.2	And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here 
GEN.46.3	And he said, I 
GEN.46.4	I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up 
GEN.46.5	And Jacob rose up from Beer–sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
GEN.46.6	 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: 
GEN.46.7	his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
GEN.46.8	And these 
GEN.46.9	And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 
GEN.46.10	And the sons of Simeon; Jem´u-el, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Sha´ul the son of a Canaanitish woman. 
GEN.46.11	And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Mera´ri. 
GEN.46.12	And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. 
GEN.46.13	And the sons of Is´sachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron. 
GEN.46.14	And the sons of Zeb´ulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jah´leel. 
GEN.46.15	These 
GEN.46.16	And the sons of Gad; Ziph´i-on, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Ar´odi, and Ar´eli. 
GEN.46.17	And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ish´u-ah, and Is´u-i, and Beri´ah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beri´ah; Heber, and Mal´chi-el. 
GEN.46.18	These 
GEN.46.19	The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manas´seh and E´phra-im, which As´enath the daughter of Potiphe´rah priest of On bare unto him. 
GEN.46.21	And the sons of Benjamin 
GEN.46.22	These 
GEN.46.23	And the sons of Dan; Hushim. 
GEN.46.24	And the sons of Naph´tali; Jah´zeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. 
GEN.46.25	These 
GEN.46.26	All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls 
GEN.46.27	 and the sons of Joseph, which were borne him in Egypt, 
GEN.46.28	And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 
GEN.46.29	And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 
GEN.46.30	And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou 
GEN.46.31	And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which 
GEN.46.32	and the men 
GEN.46.33	And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What 
GEN.46.34	That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, 
GEN.47.1	Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they 
GEN.47.2	And he took some of his brethren, 
GEN.47.3	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What 
GEN.47.4	They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine 
GEN.47.5	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: 
GEN.47.6	the land of Egypt 
GEN.47.7	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.8	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old 
GEN.47.9	And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage 
GEN.47.10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.11	And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Ram´eses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
GEN.47.12	And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to 
GEN.47.13	And 
GEN.47.14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 
GEN.47.15	And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. 
GEN.47.16	And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. 
GEN.47.17	And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread 
GEN.47.18	When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide 
GEN.47.19	wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give 
GEN.47.20	And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's. 
GEN.47.21	And as for the people, he removed them to cities from 
GEN.47.22	Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion 
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, 
GEN.47.24	And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth 
GEN.47.25	And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. 
GEN.47.26	And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, 
GEN.47.27	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly. 
GEN.47.28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred forty and seven years.
GEN.47.29	And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 
GEN.47.30	but I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. 
GEN.47.31	And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
GEN.48.1	And it came to pass after these things, that 
GEN.48.2	And 
GEN.48.3	 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
GEN.48.4	and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee 
GEN.48.5	And now thy two sons, E´phra-im and Manas´seh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, 
GEN.48.6	And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, 
GEN.48.7	 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet 
GEN.48.8	And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who 
GEN.48.9	And Joseph said unto his father, They 
GEN.48.10	Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, 
GEN.48.11	And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath showed me also thy seed. 
GEN.48.12	And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
GEN.48.13	And Joseph took them both, E´phra-im in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manas´seh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought 
GEN.48.14	And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid 
GEN.48.15	And he blessed Joseph, and said,
GEN.48.15	God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk,
GEN.48.15	the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
GEN.48.16	the angel which redeemed me from all evil,
GEN.48.16	bless the lads;
GEN.48.16	and let my name be named on them,
GEN.48.16	and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
GEN.48.16	and let them grow into a multitude
GEN.48.16	in the midst of the earth.
GEN.48.17	And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of E´phra-im, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from E´phra-im's head unto Manas´seh's head. 
GEN.48.18	And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this 
GEN.48.19	And his father refused, and said, I know 
GEN.48.20	 And he blessed them that day, saying,
GEN.48.20	In thee shall Israel bless, saying,
GEN.48.20	God make thee as E´phra-im and as Manas´seh:
GEN.48.20	and he set E´phra-im before Manas´seh. 
GEN.48.21	And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. 
GEN.48.22	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
GEN.49.1	And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you 
GEN.49.2	Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob;
GEN.49.2	and hearken unto Israel your father.
GEN.49.3	Reuben, thou 
GEN.49.3	my might, and the beginning of my strength,
GEN.49.3	the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
GEN.49.4	unstable as water, thou shalt not excel;
GEN.49.4	because thou wentest up to thy father's bed;
GEN.49.4	then defiledst thou 
GEN.49.5	Simeon and Levi 
GEN.49.5	instruments of cruelty 
GEN.49.6	O my soul, come not thou into their secret;
GEN.49.6	unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united:
GEN.49.6	for in their anger they slew a man,
GEN.49.6	and in their self-will they digged down a wall.
GEN.49.7	Cursed 
GEN.49.7	and their wrath, for it was cruel:
GEN.49.7	I will divide them in Jacob,
GEN.49.7	and scatter them in Israel.
GEN.49.8	Judah, thou 
GEN.49.8	thy hand 
GEN.49.8	thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
GEN.49.9	from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:
GEN.49.9	he stooped down, he couched as a lion,
GEN.49.9	and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
GEN.49.10	The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,
GEN.49.10	nor a lawgiver from between his feet,
GEN.49.10	until Shiloh come;
GEN.49.10	and unto him 
GEN.49.11	Binding his foal unto the vine,
GEN.49.11	and his ass's colt unto the choice vine;
GEN.49.11	he washed his garments in wine,
GEN.49.11	and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
GEN.49.12	his eyes 
GEN.49.12	and his teeth white with milk.
GEN.49.13	Zeb´ulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea;
GEN.49.13	and he 
GEN.49.13	and his border 
GEN.49.14	Is´sachar 
GEN.49.14	couching down between two burdens:
GEN.49.15	and he saw that rest 
GEN.49.15	and the land that 
GEN.49.15	and bowed his shoulder to bear,
GEN.49.15	and became a servant unto tribute.
GEN.49.16	Dan shall judge his people,
GEN.49.16	as one of the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan shall be a serpent by the way,
GEN.49.17	an adder in the path,
GEN.49.17	that biteth the horse heels,
GEN.49.17	so that his rider shall fall backward.
GEN.49.18	I have waited for thy salvation, O 
GEN.49.19	Gad, a troop shall overcome him:
GEN.49.19	but he shall overcome at the last.
GEN.49.20	Out of Asher his bread 
GEN.49.20	and he shall yield royal dainties.
GEN.49.21	Naph´tali 
GEN.49.21	he giveth goodly words.
GEN.49.22	Joseph 
GEN.49.23	the archers have sorely grieved him,
GEN.49.23	and shot 
GEN.49.24	but his bow abode in strength,
GEN.49.24	and the arms of his hands were made strong
GEN.49.24	by the hands of the mighty 
GEN.49.24	(from thence 
GEN.49.25	and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee
GEN.49.25	with blessings of heaven above,
GEN.49.25	blessings of the deep that lieth under,
GEN.49.25	blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
GEN.49.26	the blessings of thy father have prevailed
GEN.49.26	above the blessings of my progenitors
GEN.49.26	unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:
GEN.49.26	they shall be on the head of Joseph,
GEN.49.26	and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
GEN.49.27	Benjamin shall raven 
GEN.49.27	in the morning he shall devour the prey,
GEN.49.27	and at night he shall divide the spoil.
GEN.49.28	All these 
GEN.49.29	And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that 
GEN.49.30	 in the cave that 
GEN.49.31	 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Le´ah. 
GEN.49.32	The purchase of the field and of the cave that 
GEN.49.33	 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
GEN.50.1	And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
GEN.50.3	And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
GEN.50.4	And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
GEN.50.5	 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. 
GEN.50.6	And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. 
GEN.50.7	And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
GEN.50.8	and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. 
GEN.50.10	And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which 
GEN.50.11	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This 
GEN.50.12	And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 
GEN.50.13	 for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpe´lah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. 
GEN.50.14	And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
GEN.50.15	And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. 
GEN.50.16	And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, 
GEN.50.17	So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. 
GEN.50.18	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we 
GEN.50.19	And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for 
GEN.50.20	But as for you, ye thought evil against me; 
GEN.50.21	Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
GEN.50.22	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. 
GEN.50.23	And Joseph saw E´phra-im's children of the third 
GEN.50.24	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
GEN.50.25	 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died, 
EXO.1.1	Now these 
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
EXO.1.3	Is´sachar, Zeb´ulun, and Benjamin, 
EXO.1.4	Dan, and Naph´tali, Gad, and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt 
EXO.1.6	And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. 
EXO.1.7	 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
EXO.1.9	And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel 
EXO.1.10	 come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and 
EXO.1.11	Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raam´ses. 
EXO.1.12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 
EXO.1.13	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor: 
EXO.1.14	and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, 
EXO.1.15	And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one 
EXO.1.16	and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see 
EXO.1.17	But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. 
EXO.1.18	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? 
EXO.1.19	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women 
EXO.1.20	Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 
EXO.1.21	And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 
EXO.1.22	 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
EXO.2.1	And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took 
EXO.2.2	 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he 
EXO.2.3	And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid 
EXO.2.4	And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. 
EXO.2.5	And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash 
EXO.2.6	And when she had opened 
EXO.2.7	Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 
EXO.2.8	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. 
EXO.2.9	And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give 
EXO.2.10	 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses:
EXO.2.12	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that 
EXO.2.13	And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 
EXO.2.14	And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 
EXO.2.15	 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
EXO.2.15	But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Mid´i-an: and he sat down by a well. 
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Mid´i-an had seven daughters: and they came and drew 
EXO.2.17	And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
EXO.2.18	And when they came to Reu´el their father, he said, How 
EXO.2.19	And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew 
EXO.2.20	And he said unto his daughters, And where 
EXO.2.21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zippo´rah his daughter. 
EXO.2.22	And she bare 
EXO.2.23	And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 
EXO.2.24	 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto 
EXO.3.1	Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Mid´i-an: and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, 
EXO.3.2	 And the angel of the 
EXO.3.3	And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 
EXO.3.4	And when the 
EXO.3.5	And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest 
EXO.3.6	Moreover he said, I 
EXO.3.7	And the 
EXO.3.8	and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Per´izzites, and the Hivites, and the Jeb´usites. 
EXO.3.9	Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. 
EXO.3.10	Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. 
EXO.3.11	And Moses said unto God, Who 
EXO.3.12	And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this 
EXO.3.14	 And God said unto Moses, 
EXO.3.15	And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The 
EXO.3.16	Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The 
EXO.3.17	and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Per´izzites, and the Hivites, and the Jeb´usites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. 
EXO.3.18	And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The 
EXO.3.19	And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. 
EXO.3.20	And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. 
EXO.3.21	 And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: 
EXO.3.22	but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put 
EXO.4.1	And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The 
EXO.4.2	And the 
EXO.4.3	And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 
EXO.4.4	And the 
EXO.4.5	that they may believe that the 
EXO.4.6	And the 
EXO.4.7	And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his 
EXO.4.8	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 
EXO.4.9	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour 
EXO.4.10	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.4.11	And the 
EXO.4.12	Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. 
EXO.4.13	And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand 
EXO.4.14	And the anger of the 
EXO.4.15	And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 
EXO.4.16	And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, 
EXO.4.17	And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.
EXO.4.18	And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which 
EXO.4.19	And the 
EXO.4.20	And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
EXO.4.21	And the 
EXO.4.22	And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the 
EXO.4.23	 and I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, 
EXO.4.24	And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the 
EXO.4.25	Then Zippo´rah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast 
EXO.4.26	So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband 
EXO.4.27	And the 
EXO.4.28	And Moses told Aaron all the words of the 
EXO.4.29	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: 
EXO.4.30	and Aaron spake all the words which the 
EXO.4.31	And the people believed: and when they heard that the 
EXO.5.1	And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the 
EXO.5.2	And Pharaoh said, Who 
EXO.5.3	And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the 
EXO.5.4	And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. 
EXO.5.5	And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now 
EXO.5.6	And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 
EXO.5.7	Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
EXO.5.8	And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish 
EXO.5.9	Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard vain words.
EXO.5.10	And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 
EXO.5.11	Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not aught of your work shall be diminished. 
EXO.5.12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 
EXO.5.13	And the taskmasters hasted 
EXO.5.14	And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, 
EXO.5.15	Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 
EXO.5.16	There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants 
EXO.5.17	But he said, Ye 
EXO.5.18	Go therefore now, 
EXO.5.19	And the officers of the children of Israel did see 
EXO.5.20	And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 
EXO.5.21	and they said unto them, The 
EXO.5.22	And Moses returned unto the 
EXO.5.23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
EXO.6.1	Then the 
EXO.6.3	and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by 
EXO.6.4	And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. 
EXO.6.5	And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. 
EXO.6.6	Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, 
EXO.6.7	and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I 
EXO.6.8	And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I 
EXO.6.9	And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
EXO.6.10	And the 
EXO.6.11	Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
EXO.6.12	And Moses spake before the 
EXO.6.13	And the 
EXO.6.14	These 
EXO.6.15	And the sons of Simeon; Jem´u-el, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Sha´ul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these 
EXO.6.16	 And these 
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families. 
EXO.6.18	And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uz´zi-el: and the years of the life of Kohath 
EXO.6.19	And the sons of Mera´ri; Ma´hali and Mushi: these 
EXO.6.20	And Amram took him Joch´ebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram 
EXO.6.21	And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 
EXO.6.22	And the sons of Uz´zi-el; Mish´a-el, and Elza´phan, and Zithri. 
EXO.6.23	And Aaron took him Elish´eba, daughter of Ammin´adab, sister of Naa´shon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab and Abi´hu, Ele-a´zar and Ith´amar. 
EXO.6.24	And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elka´nah, and Abi´asaph: these 
EXO.6.25	And Ele-a´zar Aaron's son took him 
EXO.6.26	These 
EXO.6.27	These 
EXO.6.28	And it came to pass on the day 
EXO.6.29	that the 
EXO.6.30	And Moses said before the 
EXO.7.1	And the 
EXO.7.2	Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 
EXO.7.3	 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.4	But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, 
EXO.7.5	And the Egyptians shall know that I 
EXO.7.6	And Moses and Aaron did as the 
EXO.7.7	And Moses 
EXO.7.8	And the 
EXO.7.9	When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast 
EXO.7.10	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the 
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 
EXO.7.12	For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 
EXO.7.13	And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the 
EXO.7.14	And the 
EXO.7.15	Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 
EXO.7.16	And thou shalt say unto him, The 
EXO.7.17	 Thus saith the 
EXO.7.18	And the fish that 
EXO.7.19	And the 
EXO.7.20	And Moses and Aaron did so, as the 
EXO.7.21	And the fish that 
EXO.7.22	And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the 
EXO.7.23	And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. 
EXO.7.24	And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
EXO.7.25	And seven days were fulfilled, after that the 
EXO.8.1	And the 
EXO.8.2	And if thou refuse to let 
EXO.8.3	and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: 
EXO.8.4	and the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. 
EXO.8.5	And the 
EXO.8.6	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.7	And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the 
EXO.8.9	And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, 
EXO.8.10	And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, 
EXO.8.11	And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. 
EXO.8.12	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the 
EXO.8.13	And the 
EXO.8.14	And they gathered them together upon heaps; and the land stank. 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the 
EXO.8.16	And the 
EXO.8.17	And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.18	And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 
EXO.8.19	Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This 
EXO.8.20	And the 
EXO.8.21	Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they 
EXO.8.22	And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I 
EXO.8.23	And I will put a division between my people and thy people: tomorrow shall this sign be. 
EXO.8.24	And the 
EXO.8.25	And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 
EXO.8.26	And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the 
EXO.8.27	We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.28	And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.29	And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the 
EXO.8.30	And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the 
EXO.8.31	And the 
EXO.8.32	And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	For if thou refuse to let 
EXO.9.3	behold, the hand of the 
EXO.9.4	And the 
EXO.9.5	And the 
EXO.9.6	And the 
EXO.9.7	And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	And the 
EXO.9.9	And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth 
EXO.9.10	 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth 
EXO.9.11	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	And the 
EXO.9.13	And the 
EXO.9.14	For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that 
EXO.9.15	For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. 
EXO.9.16	 And in very deed for this 
EXO.9.17	As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? 
EXO.9.18	Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now. 
EXO.9.19	Send therefore now, 
EXO.9.20	He that feared the word of the 
EXO.9.21	and he that regarded not the word of the 
EXO.9.22	And the 
EXO.9.23	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the 
EXO.9.24	 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
EXO.9.25	And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that 
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel 
EXO.9.27	And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the 
EXO.9.28	Entreat the 
EXO.9.29	And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the 
EXO.9.30	But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the 
EXO.9.31	And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they 
EXO.9.33	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the 
EXO.9.34	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
EXO.9.35	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the 
EXO.10.1	And the 
EXO.10.2	and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I 
EXO.10.3	And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
EXO.10.4	Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast: 
EXO.10.5	and they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: 
EXO.10.6	and they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
EXO.10.7	And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the 
EXO.10.8	And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the 
EXO.10.9	And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we 
EXO.10.10	And he said unto them, Let the 
EXO.10.11	Not so: go now ye 
EXO.10.12	And the 
EXO.10.13	And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the 
EXO.10.14	 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous 
EXO.10.15	For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the 
EXO.10.18	And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the 
EXO.10.19	And the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.22	And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 
EXO.10.23	they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. 
EXO.10.24	And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the 
EXO.10.25	And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the 
EXO.10.26	Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in 
EXO.10.29	And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.
EXO.11.1	And the 
EXO.11.2	Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. 
EXO.11.3	And the 
EXO.11.4	And Moses said, Thus saith the 
EXO.11.5	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that 
EXO.11.6	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 
EXO.11.7	But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the 
EXO.11.8	And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. 
EXO.11.9	And the 
EXO.11.10	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the 
EXO.12.2	This month 
EXO.12.3	Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth 
EXO.12.4	and if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his house take 
EXO.12.5	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take 
EXO.12.6	and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. 
EXO.12.7	And they shall take of the blood, and strike 
EXO.12.8	And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; 
EXO.12.9	Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast 
EXO.12.10	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. 
EXO.12.11	And thus shall ye eat it; 
EXO.12.12	For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I 
EXO.12.13	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye 
EXO.12.15	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 
EXO.12.16	And in the first day 
EXO.12.17	And ye shall observe 
EXO.12.18	In the first 
EXO.12.19	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. 
EXO.12.20	Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
EXO.12.21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. 
EXO.12.22	And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip 
EXO.12.23	 For the 
EXO.12.24	And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 
EXO.12.25	And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the 
EXO.12.26	And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? 
EXO.12.27	That ye shall say, It 
EXO.12.28	And the children of Israel went away, and did as the 
EXO.12.30	And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for 
EXO.12.31	And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, 
EXO.12.32	Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
EXO.12.33	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We 
EXO.12.34	And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 
EXO.12.35	 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: 
EXO.12.36	and the 
EXO.12.37	And the children of Israel journeyed from Ram´eses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot 
EXO.12.38	And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, 
EXO.12.39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.
EXO.12.41	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the 
EXO.12.42	It 
EXO.12.43	And the 
EXO.12.44	but every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. 
EXO.12.45	A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof. 
EXO.12.46	 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 
EXO.12.47	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
EXO.12.48	And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the 
EXO.12.49	One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.
EXO.12.50	Thus did all the children of Israel; as the 
EXO.12.51	And it came to pass the selfsame day, 
EXO.13.1	And the 
EXO.13.2	 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, 
EXO.13.3	And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the 
EXO.13.4	This day came ye out in the month Abib. 
EXO.13.5	And it shall be when the 
EXO.13.6	Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day 
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. 
EXO.13.8	And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, 
EXO.13.9	And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the 
EXO.13.10	Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.
EXO.13.11	And it shall be when the 
EXO.13.12	 that thou shalt set apart unto the 
EXO.13.13	And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. 
EXO.13.14	And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What 
EXO.13.15	and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the 
EXO.13.16	And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the 
EXO.13.17	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not 
EXO.13.18	but God led the people about, 
EXO.13.19	 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. 
EXO.13.20	And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
EXO.13.21	And the 
EXO.13.22	He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, 
EXO.14.1	And the 
EXO.14.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi–hahi´roth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Ba´al–ze´phon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. 
EXO.14.3	For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They 
EXO.14.4	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I 
EXO.14.5	And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 
EXO.14.6	And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: 
EXO.14.7	and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 
EXO.14.8	And the 
EXO.14.9	But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses 
EXO.14.10	And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the 
EXO.14.11	And they said unto Moses, Because 
EXO.14.12	 not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For 
EXO.14.13	And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	And the 
EXO.14.16	but lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry 
EXO.14.17	And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 
EXO.14.18	And the Egyptians shall know that I 
EXO.14.19	And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: 
EXO.14.20	and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness 
EXO.14.21	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the 
EXO.14.22	 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry 
EXO.14.23	And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, 
EXO.14.24	And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the 
EXO.14.25	and took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the 
EXO.14.26	And the 
EXO.14.27	And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the 
EXO.14.28	And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, 
EXO.14.29	But the children of Israel walked upon dry 
EXO.14.30	Thus the 
EXO.14.31	And Israel saw that great work which the 
EXO.15.1	I will sing unto the 
EXO.15.1	the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
EXO.15.2	and he is become my salvation:
EXO.15.2	he 
EXO.15.2	my father's God, and I will exalt him.
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.3	the 
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea:
EXO.15.4	his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
EXO.15.5	The depths have covered them:
EXO.15.5	they sank into the bottom as a stone.
EXO.15.6	Thy right hand, O 
EXO.15.6	thy right hand, O 
EXO.15.7	And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee:
EXO.15.7	thou sentest forth thy wrath, 
EXO.15.8	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together,
EXO.15.8	the floods stood upright as a heap,
EXO.15.9	The enemy said,
EXO.15.9	I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
EXO.15.9	my lust shall be satisfied upon them;
EXO.15.9	I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
EXO.15.10	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them:
EXO.15.10	they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	Who 
EXO.15.11	Who 
EXO.15.11	fearful 
EXO.15.12	Thou stretchedst out thy right hand,
EXO.15.12	the earth swallowed them.
EXO.15.13	Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people 
EXO.15.13	thou hast guided 
EXO.15.14	The people shall hear, 
EXO.15.14	sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palesti´na.
EXO.15.15	Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed;
EXO.15.15	the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them;
EXO.15.15	all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
EXO.15.16	Fear and dread shall fall upon them;
EXO.15.16	by the greatness of thine arm they shall be 
EXO.15.16	till thy people pass over, O 
EXO.15.16	till the people pass over, 
EXO.15.17	Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance,
EXO.15.18	The 
EXO.15.19	For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the 
EXO.15.20	And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. 
EXO.15.21	And Miriam answered them,
EXO.15.21	Sing ye to the 
EXO.15.21	the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
EXO.15.22	So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 
EXO.15.23	And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they 
EXO.15.24	And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 
EXO.15.25	And he cried unto the 
EXO.15.25	There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, 
EXO.15.26	and said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the 
EXO.15.27	And they came to Elim, where 
EXO.16.1	And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which 
EXO.16.2	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 
EXO.16.3	and the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the 
EXO.16.5	And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare 
EXO.16.6	And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the 
EXO.16.7	and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the 
EXO.16.8	And Moses said, 
EXO.16.9	And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the 
EXO.16.10	And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the 
EXO.16.11	And the 
EXO.16.12	I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I 
EXO.16.13	And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. 
EXO.16.14	And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness 
EXO.16.15	And when the children of Israel saw 
EXO.16.16	This 
EXO.16.17	And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. 
EXO.16.18	 And when they did mete 
EXO.16.19	And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 
EXO.16.20	Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. 
EXO.16.21	And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
EXO.16.22	And it came to pass, 
EXO.16.23	 And he said unto them, This 
EXO.16.24	And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. 
EXO.16.25	And Moses said, Eat that today; for today 
EXO.16.26	Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, 
EXO.16.27	And it came to pass, 
EXO.16.28	And the 
EXO.16.29	See, for that the 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.32	And Moses said, This 
EXO.16.33	 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the 
EXO.16.34	As the 
EXO.16.35	 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited: they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. 
EXO.16.36	Now an omer 
EXO.17.2	Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the 
EXO.17.3	And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore 
EXO.17.4	And Moses cried unto the 
EXO.17.5	And the 
EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
EXO.17.7	And he called the name of the place Massah,
EXO.17.8	Then came Am´alek, and fought with Israel in Reph´idim. 
EXO.17.9	And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Am´alek: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. 
EXO.17.10	So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Am´alek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Am´alek prevailed. 
EXO.17.12	But Moses' hands 
EXO.17.13	And Joshua discomfited Am´alek and his people with the edge of the sword.
EXO.17.15	And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah–nis´si:
EXO.17.16	for he said, Because the 
EXO.18.1	When Jethro, the priest of Mid´i-an, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, 
EXO.18.2	 then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zippo´rah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back, 
EXO.18.3	 and her two sons; of which the name of the one 
EXO.18.4	and the name of the other 
EXO.18.5	and Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 
EXO.18.6	and he said unto Moses, I thy father-in-law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. 
EXO.18.7	And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of 
EXO.18.8	And Moses told his father-in-law all that the 
EXO.18.9	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the 
EXO.18.10	And Jethro said, Blessed 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the 
EXO.18.12	And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
EXO.18.13	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. 
EXO.18.14	And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What 
EXO.18.15	And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God: 
EXO.18.16	when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make 
EXO.18.17	And Moses' father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest 
EXO.18.18	Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that 
EXO.18.19	Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to Godward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: 
EXO.18.20	and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
EXO.18.21	Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place 
EXO.18.22	and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, 
EXO.18.23	If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee 
EXO.18.24	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. 
EXO.18.25	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
EXO.18.26	And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
EXO.18.27	And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
EXO.19.1	In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they 
EXO.19.2	For they were departed from Reph´idim, and were come 
EXO.19.3	And Moses went up unto God, and the 
EXO.19.4	Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and 
EXO.19.5	 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth 
EXO.19.6	 and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These 
EXO.19.7	And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the 
EXO.19.8	And all the people answered together, and said, All that the 
EXO.19.9	And the 
EXO.19.9	And Moses told the words of the people unto the 
EXO.19.10	And the 
EXO.19.11	and be ready against the third day: for the third day the 
EXO.19.12	 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, 
EXO.19.13	there shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether 
EXO.19.14	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 
EXO.19.15	And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at 
EXO.19.17	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
EXO.19.18	And mount Si´nai was altogether on a smoke, because the 
EXO.19.19	And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 
EXO.19.20	And the 
EXO.19.21	And the 
EXO.19.22	And let the priests also, which come near to the 
EXO.19.23	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.19.24	And the 
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.
EXO.20.1	And God spake all these words, saying,
EXO.20.2	I 
EXO.20.3	Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
EXO.20.5	 thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the 
EXO.20.6	and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
EXO.20.9	 Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: 
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day 
EXO.20.11	 for 
EXO.20.19	And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 
EXO.20.20	And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
EXO.20.21	And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God 
EXO.20.22	And the 
EXO.20.23	Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. 
EXO.20.24	An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. 
EXO.20.25	 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. 
EXO.20.26	Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
EXO.21.1	Now these 
EXO.21.2	 If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 
EXO.21.3	If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him. 
EXO.21.4	If his master have given him a wife, and she have borne him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. 
EXO.21.5	And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: 
EXO.21.6	then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the doorpost; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
EXO.21.7	And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. 
EXO.21.8	If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. 
EXO.21.9	And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. 
EXO.21.10	If he take him another 
EXO.21.11	And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.
EXO.21.13	 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver 
EXO.21.14	But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.
EXO.21.15	And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
EXO.21.18	And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with 
EXO.21.19	if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote 
EXO.21.20	And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. 
EXO.21.21	Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he 
EXO.21.22	If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart 
EXO.21.23	And if 
EXO.21.24	 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
EXO.21.25	burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
EXO.21.26	And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. 
EXO.21.27	And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.
EXO.21.28	If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox 
EXO.21.29	But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. 
EXO.21.30	If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 
EXO.21.31	Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

EXO.30.19	For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:

EXO.31.1	And the 
EXO.31.2	See, I have called by name Bez´aleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
EXO.31.3	and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 
EXO.31.4	to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
EXO.31.5	and in cutting of stones, to set 
EXO.31.6	And I, behold, I have given with him Aho´li-ab, the son of Ahis´amach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; 
EXO.31.7	the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that 
EXO.31.8	and the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, 
EXO.31.9	and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, 
EXO.31.10	and the clothes of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office, 
EXO.31.11	and the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy 
EXO.31.12	And the 
EXO.31.13	Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it 
EXO.31.14	Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it 
EXO.31.15	 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh 
EXO.31.16	Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, 
EXO.31.17	It 
EXO.31.18	And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Si´nai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
EXO.32.2	And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which 
EXO.32.3	And all the people brake off the golden earrings which 
EXO.32.4	 And he received 
EXO.32.5	And when Aaron saw 
EXO.32.6	 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
EXO.32.7	And the 
EXO.32.8	they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These 
EXO.32.9	And the 
EXO.32.10	now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
EXO.32.12	Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 
EXO.32.13	 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit 
EXO.32.14	And the 
EXO.32.15	And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony 
EXO.32.16	And the tables 
EXO.32.17	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, 
EXO.32.18	And he said, 
EXO.32.19	And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 
EXO.32.20	And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt 
EXO.32.21	And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? 
EXO.32.22	And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they 
EXO.32.23	For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for 
EXO.32.24	And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break 
EXO.32.25	And when Moses saw that the people 
EXO.32.26	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who 
EXO.32.27	And he said unto them, Thus saith the 
EXO.32.28	And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
EXO.32.29	For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the 
EXO.32.30	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the 
EXO.32.31	And Moses returned unto the 
EXO.32.32	 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 
EXO.32.33	And the 
EXO.32.34	Therefore now go, lead the people unto 
EXO.32.35	And the 
EXO.33.2	and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Per´izzite, the Hivite, and the Jeb´usite: 
EXO.33.3	unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou 
EXO.33.4	And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. 
EXO.33.5	For the 
EXO.33.6	And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.
EXO.33.7	And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, 
EXO.33.8	And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, 
EXO.33.9	And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood 
EXO.33.10	And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand 
EXO.33.11	And the 
EXO.33.12	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.33.13	Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation 
EXO.33.14	And he said, My presence shall go 
EXO.33.15	And he said unto him, If thy presence go not 
EXO.33.16	For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? 
EXO.33.17	And the 
EXO.33.18	And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory. 
EXO.33.19	 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the 
EXO.33.20	And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. 
EXO.33.21	And the 
EXO.33.22	and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 
EXO.33.23	and I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts; but my face shall not be seen.
EXO.34.1	And the 
EXO.34.2	And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Si´nai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. 
EXO.34.3	And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. 
EXO.34.4	And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Si´nai, as the 
EXO.34.5	And the 
EXO.34.6	 And the 
EXO.34.7	keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear 
EXO.34.8	And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. 
EXO.34.9	And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it 
EXO.34.10	And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou 
EXO.34.11	Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Per´izzite, and the Hivite, and the Jeb´usite. 
EXO.34.12	Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: 
EXO.34.13	 but ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: 
EXO.34.14	for thou shalt worship no other god: for the 
EXO.34.15	Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and 
EXO.34.16	and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.
EXO.34.19	 All that openeth the matrix 
EXO.34.20	 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem 
EXO.34.22	 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. 
EXO.34.23	Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord 
EXO.34.24	For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the 
EXO.34.26	 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the 
EXO.34.27	And the 
EXO.34.28	And he was there with the 
EXO.34.30	And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 
EXO.34.31	And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. 
EXO.34.32	And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the 
EXO.34.33	And 
EXO.34.34	But when Moses went in before the 
EXO.34.35	And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
EXO.35.1	And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These 
EXO.35.2	 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the 
EXO.35.3	Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
EXO.35.4	And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This 
EXO.35.5	Take ye from among you an offering unto the 
EXO.35.6	and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' 
EXO.35.7	and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

EXO.35.9	and onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
EXO.35.10	And every wise-hearted among you shall come, and make all that the 
EXO.35.11	the tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets; 
EXO.35.12	the ark, and the staves thereof,

EXO.35.20	And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
EXO.35.21	And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, 
EXO.35.22	And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, 
EXO.35.23	And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' 
EXO.35.24	Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the

EXO.35.28	and spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 
EXO.35.29	The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the 
EXO.35.30	And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the 
EXO.35.31	and he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 
EXO.35.32	and to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
EXO.35.33	and in the cutting of stones, to set

EXO.36.4	And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made; 
EXO.36.5	and they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the 
EXO.36.6	And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. 
EXO.36.7	For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
EXO.36.8	And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains

EXO.39.42	According to all that the 
EXO.39.43	And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the 
EXO.40.1	And the 
EXO.40.2	On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
EXO.40.3	And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the veil. 
EXO.40.4	And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 
EXO.40.5	And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. 
EXO.40.6	And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
EXO.40.7	And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 
EXO.40.8	And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate. 
EXO.40.9	And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that 
EXO.40.10	And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.

EXO.40.16	Thus did Moses: according to all that the 
EXO.40.17	And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first 
EXO.40.18	And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. 
EXO.40.19	And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the 
EXO.40.20	And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 
EXO.40.21	and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the 
EXO.40.22	And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil. 
EXO.40.23	And he set the bread in order upon it before the 
EXO.40.24	And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
EXO.40.25	And he lighted the lamps before the 
EXO.40.26	And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil: 
EXO.40.27	and he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the 
EXO.40.28	And he set up the hanging 
EXO.40.29	And he put the altar of burnt offering 
EXO.40.30	And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash 
EXO.40.31	And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: 
EXO.40.32	when they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the 
EXO.40.33	And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.
EXO.40.34	Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.35	And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.36	And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 
EXO.40.37	but if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.

LEV.8.5	And Moses said unto the congregation, This 
LEV.8.6	And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 
LEV.8.7	And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound 
LEV.8.8	And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim. 
LEV.8.9	And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, 
LEV.8.10	And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that 
LEV.8.11	And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them. 
LEV.8.12	And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. 
LEV.8.13	And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the 
LEV.8.14	And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering. 
LEV.8.15	And he slew 
LEV.8.16	And he took all the fat that 
LEV.8.17	But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the 
LEV.8.18	And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.19	And he killed 
LEV.8.20	And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat. 
LEV.8.21	And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it 
LEV.8.22	And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.23	And he slew 
LEV.8.24	And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. 
LEV.8.25	And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that 
LEV.8.26	and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that 
LEV.8.27	and he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them 
LEV.8.28	And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt 
LEV.8.29	And Moses took the breast, and waved it 
LEV.8.30	And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which 
LEV.8.31	And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh 
LEV.8.32	And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. 
LEV.8.33	And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 
LEV.8.34	As he hath done this day, 
LEV.8.35	Therefore shall ye abide 
LEV.8.36	So Aaron and his sons did all things which the 
LEV.9.1	And it came to pass on the eighth day, 
LEV.9.2	and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer 
LEV.9.3	And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, 
LEV.9.4	also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the 
LEV.9.5	And they brought 
LEV.9.6	And Moses said, This 
LEV.9.7	And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the 
LEV.9.8	Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which 
LEV.9.9	And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put 
LEV.9.10	but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the 
LEV.9.11	And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
LEV.9.12	And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. 
LEV.9.13	And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt 
LEV.9.14	And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt 
LEV.9.15	And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which 
LEV.9.16	And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner. 
LEV.9.17	And he brought the meat offering, and took a handful thereof, and burnt 
LEV.9.19	and the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth 
LEV.9.20	and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: 
LEV.9.21	and the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved 
LEV.9.23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the 
LEV.9.24	And there came a fire out from before the 
LEV.10.1	And Nadab and Abi´hu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the 
LEV.10.2	And there went out fire from the 
LEV.10.3	Then Moses said unto Aaron, This 
LEV.10.4	And Moses called Mish´a-el and Elza´phan, the sons of Uz´zi-el the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. 
LEV.10.5	So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said. 
LEV.10.6	And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Ele-a´zar and unto Ith´amar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the 
LEV.10.7	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the 
LEV.10.8	And the 
LEV.10.9	Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: 
LEV.10.10	and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;

LEV.18.13	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she 
LEV.18.14	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she 
LEV.18.15	 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she 
LEV.18.16	 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it 
LEV.18.17	 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; 
LEV.18.18	Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex 
LEV.18.20	 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor's wife, to defile thyself with her. 
LEV.18.21	 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through 
LEV.18.22	 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it 
LEV.18.23	 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it 
LEV.18.24	Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: 
LEV.18.25	and the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants. 
LEV.18.26	Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit 
LEV.18.27	(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, which 
LEV.18.28	that the land spew not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spewed out the nations that 
LEV.18.29	For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit 
LEV.18.30	Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that 
LEV.19.1	And the 
LEV.19.2	 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the 
LEV.19.3	 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I 
LEV.19.4	 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I 
LEV.19.5	And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the 
LEV.19.6	It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire. 
LEV.19.7	And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it 
LEV.19.8	Therefore 
LEV.19.10	And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather 
LEV.19.12	 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I 
LEV.19.14	 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I 
LEV.19.16	Thou shalt not go up and down 
LEV.19.17	Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him. 
LEV.19.18	 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I 
LEV.19.20	And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that 
LEV.19.21	And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the 
LEV.19.22	And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the 
LEV.19.23	And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of. 
LEV.19.24	But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the 
LEV.19.25	And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I 
LEV.19.27	 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. 
LEV.19.28	Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I 
LEV.19.30	 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I 
LEV.19.32	Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I 
LEV.19.34	 the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I 
LEV.19.36	Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I 
LEV.19.37	Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I 
LEV.20.1	And the 
LEV.20.2	Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever 
LEV.20.3	And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 
LEV.20.4	And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not; 
LEV.20.5	then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
LEV.20.6	And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. 
LEV.20.7	Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I 
LEV.20.8	And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I 
LEV.20.9	 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood 
LEV.20.11	 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood 
LEV.20.12	 And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood 
LEV.20.13	 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood 
LEV.20.14	 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it 
LEV.20.15	 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death; and ye shall slay the beast. 
LEV.20.16	And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood 
LEV.20.18	 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people. 
LEV.20.19	 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister; for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity. 
LEV.20.20	And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. 
LEV.20.21	 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it 
LEV.20.22	Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spew you not out. 
LEV.20.23	And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. 
LEV.20.24	But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I 
LEV.20.25	Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. 
LEV.20.26	And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the 
LEV.20.27	A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones; their blood 
LEV.21.1	And the 
LEV.21.2	but for his kin, that is near unto him, 
LEV.21.3	and for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled. 
LEV.21.4	 he shall not defile himself, 
LEV.21.5	 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 
LEV.21.6	They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the 
LEV.21.7	They shall not take a wife 
LEV.21.8	Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the 
LEV.21.9	And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
LEV.21.10	And 
LEV.21.11	neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 
LEV.21.12	neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God 
LEV.21.13	And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 
LEV.21.14	A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, 
LEV.21.15	Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the 
LEV.21.16	And the 
LEV.21.17	Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever 
LEV.21.18	For whatsoever man 
LEV.21.19	or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed, 
LEV.21.20	or crookbacked, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 
LEV.21.21	no man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the 
LEV.21.22	He shall eat the bread of his God, 
LEV.21.23	Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the 
LEV.21.24	And Moses told 
LEV.22.1	And the 
LEV.22.2	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name 
LEV.22.3	Say unto them, Whosoever 
LEV.22.4	What man soever of the seed of Aaron 
LEV.22.5	or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 
LEV.22.6	the soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water. 
LEV.22.7	And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it 
LEV.22.8	That which dieth of itself, or is torn 
LEV.22.9	They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the 
LEV.22.10	There shall no stranger eat 
LEV.22.11	But if the priest buy 
LEV.22.12	If the priest's daughter also be 
LEV.22.13	But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof. 
LEV.22.14	And if a man eat 
LEV.22.15	And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the 
LEV.22.16	or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the 
LEV.22.17	And the 
LEV.22.18	Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever 
LEV.22.19	 at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. 
LEV.22.21	And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the 
LEV.22.22	Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the 
LEV.22.23	Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer 
LEV.22.24	Ye shall not offer unto the 
LEV.22.25	Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption 
LEV.22.26	And the 
LEV.22.27	When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.22.28	And 
LEV.22.29	And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the 
LEV.22.30	On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I 
LEV.22.31	Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I 
LEV.22.32	Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I 
LEV.22.33	that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I 
LEV.23.1	And the 
LEV.23.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, 
LEV.23.3	 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day 
LEV.23.4	These 
LEV.23.5	 In the fourteenth 
LEV.23.6	 And on the fifteenth day of the same month 
LEV.23.7	In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. 
LEV.23.8	But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.9	And the 
LEV.23.10	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: 
LEV.23.11	and he shall wave the sheaf before the 
LEV.23.12	And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf a he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the 
LEV.23.13	And the meat offering thereof 
LEV.23.14	And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: 
LEV.23.16	even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the 
LEV.23.17	Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; 
LEV.23.18	And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be 
LEV.23.19	Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. 
LEV.23.20	And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits 
LEV.23.21	And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, 
LEV.23.23	And the 
LEV.23.24	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first 
LEV.23.25	Ye shall do no servile work 
LEV.23.27	Also on the tenth 
LEV.23.28	And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it 
LEV.23.29	For whatsoever soul 
LEV.23.30	And whatsoever soul 
LEV.23.31	Ye shall do no manner of work: 
LEV.23.32	It 
LEV.23.34	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month 
LEV.23.35	On the first day 
LEV.23.36	Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LEV.23.37	These 
LEV.23.38	beside the sabbaths of the 
LEV.23.40	And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the 
LEV.23.41	And ye shall keep it a feast unto the 
LEV.23.42	Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: 
LEV.23.43	that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I 
LEV.23.44	And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the 
LEV.24.1	And the 
LEV.24.2	Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually. 
LEV.24.3	Without the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the 
LEV.24.4	He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the 
LEV.24.6	And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the 
LEV.24.7	And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon 
LEV.24.8	Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the 
LEV.24.9	 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it 
LEV.24.10	And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father 
LEV.24.11	and the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name 
LEV.24.12	and they put him in ward, that the mind of the 
LEV.24.13	And the 
LEV.24.14	Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard 
LEV.24.15	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. 
LEV.24.16	And he that blasphemeth the name of the 
LEV.24.17	 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death. 
LEV.24.18	And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast. 
LEV.24.19	And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him; 
LEV.24.20	 breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him 
LEV.24.21	And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death. 
LEV.24.22	 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I 
LEV.24.23	And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones: and the children of Israel did as the 
LEV.25.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the 
LEV.25.3	Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 
LEV.25.4	but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the 
LEV.25.5	That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: 
LEV.25.6	And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee, 
LEV.25.7	and for thy cattle, and for the beast that 
LEV.25.8	And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years. 
LEV.25.9	Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth 
LEV.25.10	And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout 
LEV.25.11	A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather 
LEV.25.12	For it 
LEV.25.13	In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession. 
LEV.25.14	And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buyest 
LEV.25.15	according to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, 
LEV.25.16	according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for 
LEV.25.17	Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I 
LEV.25.18	Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. 
LEV.25.19	And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. 
LEV.25.20	And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 
LEV.25.21	then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years. 
LEV.25.22	And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat 
LEV.25.23	The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land 
LEV.25.24	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
LEV.25.25	If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away 
LEV.25.26	And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it; 
LEV.25.27	then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession. 
LEV.25.28	But if he be not able to restore 
LEV.25.29	And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; 
LEV.25.30	And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that 
LEV.25.31	But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee. 
LEV.25.32	Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, 
LEV.25.33	And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in 
LEV.25.34	But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it 
LEV.25.36	Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. 
LEV.25.37	 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. 
LEV.25.38	I 
LEV.25.40	 as a hired servant, 
LEV.25.41	and 
LEV.25.42	For they 
LEV.25.43	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor; but shalt fear thy God. 
LEV.25.44	Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, 
LEV.25.45	Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that 
LEV.25.46	And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit 
LEV.25.47	And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother 
LEV.25.48	after that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him: 
LEV.25.49	either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or 
LEV.25.50	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him. 
LEV.25.51	If 
LEV.25.52	And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, 
LEV.25.53	 as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: 
LEV.25.54	And if he be not redeemed in these 
LEV.25.55	For unto me the children of Israel 
LEV.26.2	Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I 
LEV.26.4	then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 
LEV.26.5	And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. 
LEV.26.6	And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make 
LEV.26.7	And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 
LEV.26.8	And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 
LEV.26.9	For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. 
LEV.26.10	And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new. 
LEV.26.11	And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. 
LEV.26.12	 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. 
LEV.26.13	I 
LEV.26.14	But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; 
LEV.26.15	and if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, 
LEV.26.16	I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. 
LEV.26.17	And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. 
LEV.26.18	And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. 
LEV.26.19	And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 
LEV.26.20	and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
LEV.26.21	And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. 
LEV.26.22	I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your 
LEV.26.23	And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; 
LEV.26.24	then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. 
LEV.26.25	And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of 
LEV.26.26	 when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver 
LEV.26.27	And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; 
LEV.26.28	then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. 
LEV.26.29	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. 
LEV.26.30	And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. 
LEV.26.31	And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors. 
LEV.26.32	And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 
LEV.26.33	And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
LEV.26.34	Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye 
LEV.26.35	As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 
LEV.26.36	And upon them that are left 
LEV.26.37	And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. 
LEV.26.38	And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.

NUM.11.4	And the mixed multitude that 
NUM.11.5	We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:

NUM.11.12	Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? 
NUM.11.13	Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. 
NUM.11.14	I am not able to bear all this people alone, because

NUM.13.22	And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahi´man, She´shai, and Tal´mai, the children of Anak, 
NUM.13.23	And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and 
NUM.13.24	The place was called the brook Eshcol,
NUM.13.25	And they returned from searching of the land after forty days. 
NUM.13.26	And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. 
NUM.13.27	And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this

NUM.13.30	And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. 
NUM.13.31	But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they 
NUM.13.32	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, 
NUM.13.33	 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak,

NUM.14.2	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! 
NUM.14.3	And wherefore hath the

NUM.14.21	 but 
NUM.14.22	Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 
NUM.14.23	surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: 
NUM.14.24	 but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. 
NUM.14.25	(Now the Amal´ekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

NUM.14.32	But 
NUM.14.33	 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness. 
NUM.14.34	After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, 
NUM.14.35	I the 
NUM.14.36	And the men which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, 
NUM.14.37	even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the 
NUM.14.38	But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephun´neh,

NUM.15.10	And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half a hin of wine, 
NUM.15.11	Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. 
NUM.15.12	According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number. 
NUM.15.13	All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the 
NUM.15.14	And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever 
NUM.15.15	One ordinance 
NUM.15.16	 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
NUM.15.17	And the 
NUM.15.18	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you, 
NUM.15.19	then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave offering unto the 
NUM.15.20	Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough 
NUM.15.21	Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the 
NUM.15.22	And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the 
NUM.15.23	 all that the 
NUM.15.24	then it shall be, if

NUM.15.26	and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people 
NUM.15.28	And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the 
NUM.15.29	Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, 
NUM.15.30	But the soul that doeth 
NUM.15.31	Because he hath despised the word of the 
NUM.15.32	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. 
NUM.15.33	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 
NUM.15.34	And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. 
NUM.15.35	And the 
NUM.15.36	And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the 
NUM.15.37	And the 
NUM.15.38	 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments, throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 
NUM.15.39	and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the 
NUM.15.40	that ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. 
NUM.15.41	I 
NUM.16.1	Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abi´ram, the sons of Eli´ab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took 
NUM.16.2	and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 
NUM.16.3	and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, 
NUM.16.4	And when Moses heard 
NUM.16.5	and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even tomorrow the 
NUM.16.6	This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 
NUM.16.7	and put fire therein, and put incense in them before the 
NUM.16.8	And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi: 
NUM.16.9	 a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.16.10	And he hath brought thee near 
NUM.16.11	For which cause 
NUM.16.12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abi´ram, the sons of Eli´ab; which said, We will not come up: 
NUM.16.13	 a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us? 
NUM.16.14	Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
NUM.16.15	And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the 
NUM.16.16	And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the 
NUM.16.17	and take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the 
NUM.16.18	And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.16.19	And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the 
NUM.16.20	And the 
NUM.16.21	Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. 
NUM.16.22	And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation? 
NUM.16.23	And the 
NUM.16.24	Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abi´ram.
NUM.16.25	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abi´ram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 
NUM.16.26	And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins. 
NUM.16.27	So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abi´ram, on every side: and Dathan and Abi´ram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children. 
NUM.16.28	And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the 
NUM.16.29	If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; 
NUM.16.30	But if the 
NUM.16.31	And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that 
NUM.16.32	and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that 
NUM.16.33	They, and all that 
NUM.16.34	And all Israel that 
NUM.16.35	And there came out a fire from the 
NUM.16.36	And the 
NUM.16.37	Speak unto Ele-a´zar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed. 
NUM.16.38	The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates 
NUM.16.39	And Ele-a´zar the priest took the brazen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad 
NUM.16.40	 a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which 
NUM.16.41	But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the 
NUM.16.42	And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the 
NUM.16.43	And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
NUM.16.44	And the 
NUM.16.45	Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces. 
NUM.16.46	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the 
NUM.16.47	And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people. 
NUM.16.48	And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 
NUM.16.49	Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah. 
NUM.16.50	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.
NUM.17.1	And the 
NUM.17.2	Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of 
NUM.17.3	And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod 
NUM.17.4	And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you. 
NUM.17.5	And it shall come to pass, 
NUM.17.6	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, 
NUM.17.7	And Moses laid up the rods before the 
NUM.17.9	And Moses brought out all the rods from before the 
NUM.17.10	And the 
NUM.17.11	And Moses did 
NUM.17.12	And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish. 
NUM.17.13	Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the 
NUM.18.1	And the 
NUM.18.2	And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee 
NUM.18.3	And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die. 
NUM.18.4	And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. 
NUM.18.5	And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel. 
NUM.18.6	And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you 
NUM.18.7	Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for every thing of the altar, and within the veil; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office 
NUM.18.8	And the 
NUM.18.9	This shall be thine of the most holy things, 
NUM.18.10	In the most holy 
NUM.18.11	And this 
NUM.18.12	All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the 
NUM.18.13	 whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the 
NUM.18.14	 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 
NUM.18.15	Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the 
NUM.18.16	And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which 
NUM.18.17	But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they 
NUM.18.18	And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine. 
NUM.18.19	All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the 
NUM.18.20	And the 
NUM.18.22	Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die. 
NUM.18.23	But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: 
NUM.18.24	But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer 
NUM.18.25	And the 
NUM.18.26	Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave offering of it for the 
NUM.18.27	And 
NUM.18.28	Thus ye also shall offer a heave offering unto the 
NUM.18.29	Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the 
NUM.18.30	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. 
NUM.18.31	And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it 
NUM.18.32	And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.
NUM.19.1	And the 
NUM.19.2	This 
NUM.19.3	And ye shall give her unto Ele-a´zar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and 
NUM.19.4	and Ele-a´zar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times. 
NUM.19.5	And 
NUM.19.6	and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast 
NUM.19.7	Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. 
NUM.19.8	And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. 
NUM.19.9	 And a man 
NUM.19.10	And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
NUM.19.11	He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days. 
NUM.19.12	He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. 
NUM.19.13	Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the 
NUM.19.14	This 
NUM.19.15	And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, 
NUM.19.16	And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. 
NUM.19.17	And for an unclean 
NUM.19.18	and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip 
NUM.19.19	and the clean 
NUM.19.20	But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the 
NUM.19.21	And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even. 
NUM.19.22	And whatsoever the unclean 
NUM.20.1	Then came the children of Israel, 
NUM.20.3	And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the 
NUM.20.4	And why have ye brought up the congregation of the 
NUM.20.5	And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it 
NUM.20.6	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the 
NUM.20.7	And the 
NUM.20.8	Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. 
NUM.20.9	And Moses took the rod from before the 
NUM.20.10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? 
NUM.20.11	And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts 
NUM.20.12	And the 
NUM.20.13	This 
NUM.20.14	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: 
NUM.20.15	how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers: 
NUM.20.16	and when we cried unto the 
NUM.20.17	Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink 
NUM.20.18	And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword. 
NUM.20.19	And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without 
NUM.20.20	And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. 
NUM.20.21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
NUM.20.22	And the children of Israel, 
NUM.20.23	And the 
NUM.20.24	Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Mer´ibah. 
NUM.20.25	Take Aaron and Ele-a´zar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: 
NUM.20.26	and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Ele-a´zar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered 
NUM.20.27	And Moses did as the 
NUM.20.28	 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Ele-a´zar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Ele-a´zar came down from the mount. 
NUM.20.29	And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, 
NUM.21.2	And Israel vowed a vow unto the 
NUM.21.3	And the 
NUM.21.5	And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for 
NUM.21.6	And the 
NUM.21.7	Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the 
NUM.21.8	And the 
NUM.21.9	 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole; and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
NUM.21.10	And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. 
NUM.21.11	And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije–ab´arim, in the wilderness which 
NUM.21.12	From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. 
NUM.21.13	From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which 
NUM.21.14	Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the 
NUM.21.14	What he did in the Red sea,
NUM.21.14	and in the brooks of Arnon,
NUM.21.15	and at the stream of the brooks
NUM.21.15	that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar,
NUM.21.15	and lieth upon the border of Moab.
NUM.21.16	And from thence 
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song,
NUM.21.17	Spring up, O well;
NUM.21.17	sing ye unto it:
NUM.21.18	the princes digged the well,
NUM.21.18	the nobles of the people digged it,
NUM.21.18	by 
NUM.21.18	And from the wilderness 
NUM.21.19	and from Matta´nah to Naha´li-el: and from Naha´li-el to Bamoth: 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth 
NUM.21.21	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
NUM.21.22	Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink 
NUM.21.23	And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
NUM.21.24	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon 
NUM.21.25	And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof. 
NUM.21.26	For Heshbon 
NUM.21.27	Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say,
NUM.21.27	Come into Heshbon,
NUM.21.27	let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
NUM.21.28	for there is a fire gone out of Heshbon,
NUM.21.28	a flame from the city of Sihon:
NUM.21.28	it hath consumed Ar of Moab,
NUM.21.29	Woe to thee, Moab!
NUM.21.29	Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh:
NUM.21.29	he hath given his sons that escaped,
NUM.21.29	and his daughters, into captivity
NUM.21.29	unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
NUM.21.30	We have shot at them;
NUM.21.30	Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon,
NUM.21.30	and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah,
NUM.21.30	which 
NUM.21.31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.32	And Moses sent to spy out Jaa´zer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that 
NUM.21.33	And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Ed´re-i. 
NUM.21.34	And the 
NUM.21.35	So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.
NUM.22.1	And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan 
NUM.22.2	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
NUM.22.3	And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they 
NUM.22.4	And Moab said unto the elders of Mid´i-an, Now shall this company lick up all 
NUM.22.5	He sent messengers therefore unto Ba´laam the son of Be´or to Pethor, which 
NUM.22.6	come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they 
NUM.22.7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Mid´i-an departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Ba´laam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 
NUM.22.8	And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the 
NUM.22.9	And God came unto Ba´laam, and said, What men 
NUM.22.10	And Ba´laam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, 
NUM.22.11	Behold, 
NUM.22.12	And God said unto Ba´laam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they 
NUM.22.13	And Ba´laam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the 
NUM.22.14	And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Ba´laam refuseth to come with us.
NUM.22.15	And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they. 
NUM.22.16	And they came to Ba´laam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: 
NUM.22.17	for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. 
NUM.22.18	And Ba´laam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the 
NUM.22.19	Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the 
NUM.22.20	And God came unto Ba´laam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, 
NUM.22.21	And Ba´laam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. 
NUM.22.22	And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the 
NUM.22.23	And the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.24	But the angel of the 
NUM.22.25	And when the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.26	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.27	And when the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.28	And the 
NUM.22.29	And Ba´laam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee. 
NUM.22.30	And the ass said unto Ba´laam, 
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.33	and the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive. 
NUM.22.34	And Ba´laam said unto the angel of the 
NUM.22.35	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.36	And when Balak heard that Ba´laam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which 
NUM.22.37	And Balak said unto Ba´laam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor? 
NUM.22.38	And Ba´laam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. 
NUM.22.39	And Ba´laam went with Balak, and they came unto Kir´jath–hu´zoth. 
NUM.22.40	And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Ba´laam, and to the princes that 
NUM.22.41	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Ba´laam, and brought him up into the high places of Ba´al, that thence he might see the utmost 
NUM.23.1	And Ba´laam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 
NUM.23.2	And Balak did as Ba´laam had spoken; and Balak and Ba´laam offered on 
NUM.23.3	And Ba´laam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the 
NUM.23.4	And God met Ba´laam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon 
NUM.23.5	And the 
NUM.23.6	And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab. 
NUM.23.7	And he took up his parable, and said,
NUM.23.7	Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram,
NUM.23.7	out of the mountains of the east, 
NUM.23.7	Come, curse me Jacob,
NUM.23.7	and come, defy Israel.
NUM.23.8	How shall I curse, 
NUM.23.8	Or how shall I defy, 
NUM.23.9	For from the top of the rocks I see him,
NUM.23.9	and from the hills I behold him:

NUM.23.11	And Balak said unto Ba´laam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed 
NUM.23.12	And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the 
NUM.23.13	And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence. 
NUM.23.14	And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on 
NUM.23.15	And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet 
NUM.23.16	And the 
NUM.23.17	And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the

NUM.23.18	Rise up, Balak, and hear;

NUM.23.19	neither the son of man, that he should repent:
NUM.23.19	hath he said, and shall he not do 
NUM.23.19	Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
NUM.23.20	Behold, I have received 
NUM.23.20	and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
NUM.23.21	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob,
NUM.23.21	neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel:
NUM.23.21	the 
NUM.23.21	and the shout of a king 
NUM.23.22	God brought them out of Egypt;
NUM.23.22	he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn.
NUM.23.23	Surely 
NUM.23.23	neither 
NUM.23.23	according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,
NUM.23.23	What hath God wrought!
NUM.23.24	Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion,
NUM.23.24	and lift up himself as a young lion:
NUM.23.24	he shall not lie down until he eat 
NUM.23.24	and drink the blood of the slain.
NUM.23.25	And Balak said unto Ba´laam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all. 
NUM.23.26	But Ba´laam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the 
NUM.23.27	And Balak said unto Ba´laam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. 
NUM.23.28	And Balak brought Ba´laam unto the top of Pe´or, that looketh toward Jeshi´mon. 
NUM.23.29	And Ba´laam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 
NUM.23.30	And Balak did as Ba´laam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on 
NUM.24.1	And when Ba´laam saw that it pleased the 
NUM.24.2	And Ba´laam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding 
NUM.24.3	And he took up his parable, and said,
NUM.24.3	Ba´laam the son of Be´or hath said,
NUM.24.3	and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
NUM.24.4	he hath said, 
NUM.24.4	which saw the vision of the Almighty,

NUM.24.5	How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,
NUM.24.6	As the valleys are they spread forth,
NUM.24.6	as gardens by the river's side,
NUM.24.6	as the trees of lignaloes which the

NUM.24.9	Blessed 
NUM.24.9	and cursed

NUM.24.11	Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honor; but, lo, the 
NUM.24.12	And Ba´laam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, 
NUM.24.13	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the 
NUM.24.14	And now, behold, I go unto my people: come 
NUM.24.15	And he took up his parable, and said,
NUM.24.15	Ba´laam the son of Be´or hath said,
NUM.24.15	and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
NUM.24.16	he hath said, which heard the words of God,
NUM.24.16	and knew the knowledge of the Most High,

NUM.24.17	I shall see him, but not now:
NUM.24.17	I shall behold him, but not nigh:
NUM.24.17	there shall come a Star out of Jacob,
NUM.24.17	and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel,
NUM.24.17	and shall smite the corners of Moab,
NUM.24.17	and destroy all the children of Sheth.

NUM.24.19	Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion,
NUM.24.19	and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.

NUM.24.21	and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.
NUM.24.22	Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted,
NUM.24.22	until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.

NUM.24.24	And ships 
NUM.24.24	and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber,
NUM.24.24	and he also shall perish for ever.
NUM.24.25	And Ba´laam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.
NUM.25.1	And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

NUM.25.9	And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
NUM.25.10	And the 
NUM.25.11	Phin´ehas, the son of Ele-a´zar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.

NUM.31.41	And Moses gave the tribute, 
NUM.31.42	And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred, 
NUM.31.43	(now the half 
NUM.31.44	and thirty and six thousand beeves, 
NUM.31.45	and thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 
NUM.31.46	and sixteen thousand persons,) 
NUM.31.47	even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, 
NUM.31.48	And the officers which 
NUM.31.49	and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which 
NUM.31.50	We have therefore brought an oblation for the 
NUM.31.51	And Moses and Ele-a´zar the priest took the gold of them, 
NUM.31.52	And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the 
NUM.31.53	(
NUM.31.54	And Moses and Ele-a´zar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, 
NUM.32.1	Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gil´e-ad, that, behold, the place 
NUM.32.2	the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Ele-a´zar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying, 
NUM.32.3	At´aroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Ele-a´leh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Be´on, 
NUM.32.4	 the country which the 
NUM.32.5	wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, 
NUM.32.6	And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? 
NUM.32.7	And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the 
NUM.32.8	 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Ka´desh–barne´a to see the land. 
NUM.32.9	For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the 
NUM.32.10	 And the 
NUM.32.11	Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: 
NUM.32.12	save Caleb the son of Jephun´neh the Ken´ezite, and Joshua the son of Nun; for they have wholly followed the 
NUM.32.13	And the 
NUM.32.14	And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the 
NUM.32.15	For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
NUM.32.16	And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 
NUM.32.17	but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities, because of the inhabitants of the land. 
NUM.32.18	We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance: 
NUM.32.19	for we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward. 
NUM.32.20	And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the 
NUM.32.21	and will go all of you armed over Jordan before the 
NUM.32.22	and the land be subdued before the 
NUM.32.23	But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the 
NUM.32.24	Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. 
NUM.32.25	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. 
NUM.32.26	Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gil´e-ad: 
NUM.32.27	but thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the 
NUM.32.29	and Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the 
NUM.32.30	but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan. 
NUM.32.31	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the 
NUM.32.32	We will pass over armed before the 
NUM.32.33	And Moses gave unto them, 
NUM.32.34	And the children of Gad built Dibon, and At´aroth, and Aro´er, 
NUM.32.35	and Atroth, Shophan, and Jaa´zer, and Jog´behah, 
NUM.32.36	and Beth–nim´rah, and Beth–ha´ran, fenced cities; and folds for sheep. 
NUM.32.37	And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Ele-a´leh, and Kirjatha´im, 
NUM.32.38	and Nebo, and Ba´al–me´on, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded. 
NUM.32.39	And the children of Machir the son of Manas´seh went to Gil´e-ad, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which 
NUM.32.40	And Moses gave Gil´e-ad unto Machir the son of Manas´seh; and he dwelt therein. 
NUM.32.41	And Ja´ir the son of Manas´seh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havoth–ja´ir. 
NUM.32.42	And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

NUM.33.53	and ye shall dispossess 
NUM.33.54	And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families;

NUM.34.17	These 
NUM.34.18	And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance. 
NUM.34.19	And the names of the men 
NUM.34.20	And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shem´u-el the son of Ammi´hud.

NUM.35.2	Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites, of the inheritance of their possession, cities to dwell in; and ye shall give 
NUM.35.3	And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts. 
NUM.35.4	And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, 
NUM.35.5	And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city 
NUM.35.6	And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites 
NUM.35.7	 all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites 
NUM.35.8	And the cities which ye shall give 
NUM.35.10	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
NUM.35.11	then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares. 
NUM.35.12	And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment. 
NUM.35.13	And of these cities which ye shall give, six cities shall ye have for refuge. 
NUM.35.14	Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, 
NUM.35.15	These six cities shall be a refuge, 
NUM.35.16	And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he 
NUM.35.17	And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he 
NUM.35.18	Or 
NUM.35.19	The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him. 
NUM.35.20	But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die; 
NUM.35.21	or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote 
NUM.35.22	But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait, 
NUM.35.23	or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing 
NUM.35.24	then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments: 
NUM.35.25	and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil. 
NUM.35.26	But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 
NUM.35.27	and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood: 
NUM.35.28	because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
NUM.35.29	So these 
NUM.35.30	 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person 
NUM.35.31	Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which 
NUM.35.32	And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. 
NUM.35.33	So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye 
NUM.35.34	Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the 
NUM.36.1	And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gil´e-ad, the son of Machir, the son of Manas´seh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel: 
NUM.36.2	 and they said, The 
NUM.36.3	And if they be married to any of the sons of the 
NUM.36.4	And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
NUM.36.5	And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the 
NUM.36.6	This 
NUM.36.7	So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
NUM.36.8	And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers. 
NUM.36.9	Neither shall the inheritance remove from 
NUM.36.10	Even as the 
NUM.36.11	for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelo´phehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons: 
NUM.36.12	 they were married into the families of the sons of Manas´seh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.

DEU.1.1	These 
DEU.1.2	(
DEU.1.3	And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first 
DEU.1.4	 after he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Ash´taroth in Ed´re-i: 
DEU.1.5	on this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 
DEU.1.6	The 
DEU.1.7	turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all 
DEU.1.8	Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.1.9	And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: 
DEU.1.10	the 
DEU.1.11	(The 
DEU.1.12	How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 
DEU.1.13	Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. 
DEU.1.14	And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken 
DEU.1.15	So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. 
DEU.1.16	And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear 
DEU.1.17	Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; 
DEU.1.18	And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
DEU.1.19	And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the 
DEU.1.20	And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the 
DEU.1.21	Behold, the 
DEU.1.22	And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come. 
DEU.1.23	And the saying pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe: 
DEU.1.24	and they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out. 
DEU.1.25	And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought 
DEU.1.27	and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the 
DEU.1.28	Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people 
DEU.1.29	Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. 
DEU.1.30	The 
DEU.1.31	 and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the 
DEU.1.32	 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the 
DEU.1.33	who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents 
DEU.1.35	Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers, 
DEU.1.36	save Caleb the son of Jephun´neh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the 
DEU.1.37	Also the 
DEU.1.38	 Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
DEU.1.39	Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. 
DEU.1.40	But 
DEU.1.41	Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the 
DEU.1.42	And the 
DEU.1.43	So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the 
DEU.1.44	And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Se´ir, 
DEU.1.45	And ye returned and wept before the 
DEU.1.46	So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode 
DEU.2.2	And the 
DEU.2.3	Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. 
DEU.2.4	 And command thou the people, saying, Ye 
DEU.2.5	meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a footbreadth; because I have given mount Se´ir unto Esau 
DEU.2.6	Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. 
DEU.2.7	For the 
DEU.2.8	And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Se´ir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from E´zi-on–ge´ber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 
DEU.2.9	 And the 
DEU.2.10	The Emim dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the An´akim; 
DEU.2.11	which also were accounted giants, as the An´akim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 
DEU.2.12	The Horim also dwelt in Se´ir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the 
DEU.2.13	Now rise up, 
DEU.2.14	 And the space in which we came from Ka´desh–barne´a, until we were come over the brook Zered, 
DEU.2.15	For indeed the hand of the 
DEU.2.16	So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 
DEU.2.17	that the 
DEU.2.18	Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: 
DEU.2.19	 and 
DEU.2.20	(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzum´mim; 
DEU.2.21	a people great, and many, and tall, as the An´akim; but the 
DEU.2.22	as he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Se´ir, when he destroyed the Horim from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: 
DEU.2.23	and the Avim which dwelt in Haz´erim, 
DEU.2.24	Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess 
DEU.2.25	This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations 
DEU.2.26	And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kede´moth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
DEU.2.27	Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 
DEU.2.28	Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet: 
DEU.2.29	(as the children of Esau which dwell in Se´ir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me:) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the 
DEU.2.30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the 
DEU.2.31	And the 
DEU.2.32	Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. 
DEU.2.33	And the 
DEU.2.34	And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain: 
DEU.2.35	only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took. 
DEU.2.36	From Aro´er, which 
DEU.2.37	only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, 
DEU.3.1	Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Ed´re-i. 
DEU.3.2	And the 
DEU.3.3	So the 
DEU.3.4	And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.5	All these cities 
DEU.3.6	And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. 
DEU.3.7	But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. 
DEU.3.8	And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that 
DEU.3.9	(
DEU.3.10	all the cities of the plain, and all Gil´e-ad, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Ed´re-i, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead 
DEU.3.12	And this land, 
DEU.3.13	And the rest of Gil´e-ad, and all Bashan, 
DEU.3.14	Ja´ir the son of Manas´seh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Gesh´uri and Ma-ach´athi; and called them after his own name, Ba´shan–hav´oth–ja´ir, unto this day. 
DEU.3.15	And I gave Gil´e-ad unto Machir. 
DEU.3.16	And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gil´e-ad even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, 
DEU.3.17	the plain also, and Jordan, and the coast 
DEU.3.19	But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (
DEU.3.20	until the 
DEU.3.21	And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the 
DEU.3.22	Ye shall not fear them: for the 
DEU.3.24	O Lord 
DEU.3.25	I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that 
DEU.3.26	But the 
DEU.3.27	Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold 
DEU.3.28	But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. 
DEU.3.29	So we abode in the valley over against Beth–pe´or.
DEU.4.1	Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do 
DEU.4.2	 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish 
DEU.4.3	 Your eyes have seen what the 
DEU.4.4	But ye that did cleave unto the 
DEU.4.5	Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the 
DEU.4.6	Keep therefore and do 
DEU.4.7	For what nation 
DEU.4.8	And what nation 
DEU.4.9	Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons; 
DEU.4.10	 the day that thou stoodest before the 
DEU.4.11	 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. 
DEU.4.12	And the 
DEU.4.13	 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, 
DEU.4.14	 And the 
DEU.4.15	Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day 
DEU.4.16	 lest ye corrupt 
DEU.4.17	the likeness of any beast that 
DEU.4.18	the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that 
DEU.4.19	and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, 
DEU.4.20	 But the 
DEU.4.21	 Furthermore the 
DEU.4.22	but I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land. 
DEU.4.23	Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the 
DEU.4.24	 For the 
DEU.4.25	When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt 
DEU.4.26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong 
DEU.4.27	 And the 
DEU.4.28	And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
DEU.4.29	 But if from thence thou shalt seek the 
DEU.4.30	When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, 
DEU.4.31	(for the 
DEU.4.32	For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and 
DEU.4.33	Did 
DEU.4.34	Or hath God assayed to go 
DEU.4.35	 Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that the 
DEU.4.36	Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he showed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. 
DEU.4.37	And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt; 
DEU.4.38	to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou 
DEU.4.39	Know therefore this day, and consider 
DEU.4.40	Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong 
DEU.4.42	that the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 
DEU.4.43	, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gil´e-ad, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manas´sites.
DEU.4.44	And this 
DEU.4.45	these 
DEU.4.46	on this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth–pe´or, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt: 
DEU.4.47	and they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which 
DEU.4.48	from Aro´er, which 
DEU.4.49	and all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep and do them. 
DEU.5.2	The 
DEU.5.3	The 
DEU.5.4	The

DEU.5.15	And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and 
DEU.5.23	And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, 
DEU.5.24	and ye said, Behold, the 
DEU.5.25	Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the 
DEU.5.26	For who 
DEU.5.27	Go thou near, and hear all that the 
DEU.5.28	And the 
DEU.5.29	Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! 
DEU.5.30	Go say to them, Get you into your tents again. 
DEU.5.31	But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do

DEU.6.6	 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: 
DEU.6.7	and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 
DEU.6.8	And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. 
DEU.6.9	And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
DEU.6.11	and houses full of all good 
DEU.6.12	 beware lest thou forget the 
DEU.6.13	 Thou shalt fear the 
DEU.6.14	Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which 
DEU.6.15	(for the 
DEU.6.17	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the 
DEU.6.18	And thou shalt do 
DEU.6.19	to cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the 
DEU.6.21	then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the 
DEU.6.22	and the 
DEU.6.23	and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. 
DEU.6.24	And the 
DEU.6.25	And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the 
DEU.7.2	and when the 
DEU.7.3	neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. 
DEU.7.4	For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the 
DEU.7.5	 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.

DEU.7.9	 Know therefore that the 
DEU.7.10	and repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face. 
DEU.7.11	Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.
DEU.7.13	and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee. 
DEU.7.14	Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. 
DEU.7.15	And the 
DEU.7.16	And thou shalt consume all the people which the 
DEU.7.17	If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations 
DEU.7.18	Thou shalt not be afraid of them: 
DEU.7.19	the great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the 
DEU.7.20	Moreover the 
DEU.7.21	Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the 
DEU.7.22	And the 
DEU.7.23	But the 
DEU.7.24	And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them. 
DEU.7.25	The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold 
DEU.7.26	Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: 
DEU.8.1	All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.8.2	And thou shalt remember all the way which the 
DEU.8.3	 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every 
DEU.8.4	Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. 
DEU.8.5	Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, 
DEU.8.6	Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the 
DEU.8.7	For the 
DEU.8.8	a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 
DEU.8.9	a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any 
DEU.8.10	When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the 
DEU.8.12	lest 
DEU.8.13	and 
DEU.8.14	then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the 
DEU.8.15	who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, 
DEU.8.16	who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end; 
DEU.8.17	and thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of 
DEU.8.18	But thou shalt remember the 
DEU.8.19	And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the 
DEU.8.20	As the nations which the 
DEU.9.1	Hear, O Israel: Thou 
DEU.9.2	a people great and tall, the children of the An´akim, whom thou knowest, and 
DEU.9.3	Understand therefore this day, that the 
DEU.9.4	Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the 
DEU.9.5	Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the 
DEU.9.6	Understand therefore, that the 
DEU.9.7	Remember, 
DEU.9.8	Also in Horeb ye provoked the 
DEU.9.9	 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, 
DEU.9.10	and the 
DEU.9.11	And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, 
DEU.9.12	And the 
DEU.9.13	Furthermore the 
DEU.9.14	let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. 
DEU.9.15	So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant 
DEU.9.16	And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the 
DEU.9.17	And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. 
DEU.9.18	And I fell down before the 
DEU.9.19	 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the 
DEU.9.20	And the 
DEU.9.21	And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, 
DEU.9.23	 Likewise when the 
DEU.9.24	Ye have been rebellious against the 
DEU.9.25	Thus I fell down before the 
DEU.9.26	I prayed therefore unto the 
DEU.9.27	Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin: 
DEU.9.28	lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the 
DEU.9.29	Yet they 
DEU.10.1	At that time the 
DEU.10.2	And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. 
DEU.10.3	And I made an ark 
DEU.10.4	And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the 
DEU.10.5	And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the 
DEU.10.7	From thence they journeyed unto Gudgo´dah; and from Gudgo´dah to Jot´bath, a land of rivers of waters. 
DEU.10.8	 At that time the 
DEU.10.9	Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the 
DEU.10.11	And the 
DEU.10.12	And now, Israel, what doth the 
DEU.10.13	to keep the commandments of the 
DEU.10.14	Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens 
DEU.10.15	Only the 
DEU.10.16	Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. 
DEU.10.17	 For the 
DEU.10.18	he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. 
DEU.10.19	Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	Thou shalt fear the 
DEU.10.21	He 
DEU.10.22	 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the 
DEU.11.1	Therefore thou shalt love the 
DEU.11.2	And know ye this day: for 
DEU.11.3	 and his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 
DEU.11.4	 and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and 
DEU.11.5	and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place; 
DEU.11.6	 and what he did unto Dathan and Abi´ram, the sons of Eli´ab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that 
DEU.11.7	but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the 
DEU.11.8	Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it; 
DEU.11.9	and that ye may prolong 
DEU.11.10	For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, 
DEU.11.11	but the land, whither ye go to possess it, 
DEU.11.12	a land which the 
DEU.11.14	that I will give 
DEU.11.15	And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full. 
DEU.11.16	Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 
DEU.11.17	and 
DEU.11.19	And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 
DEU.11.20	And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine house, and upon thy gates: 
DEU.11.21	that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the 
DEU.11.22	For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the 
DEU.11.23	then will the 
DEU.11.24	 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphra´tes, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. 
DEU.11.25	There shall no man be able to stand before you: 
DEU.11.26	Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 
DEU.11.27	a blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the 
DEU.11.28	and a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the 
DEU.11.29	 And it shall come to pass, when the 
DEU.11.30	 they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? 
DEU.11.31	For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the 
DEU.11.32	And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.
DEU.12.1	These 
DEU.12.2	Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: 
DEU.12.3	 and ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. 
DEU.12.4	Ye shall not do so unto the 
DEU.12.5	But unto the place which the 
DEU.12.6	and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: 
DEU.12.7	and there ye shall eat before the 
DEU.12.8	Ye shall not do after all 
DEU.12.9	For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the 
DEU.12.10	But 
DEU.12.11	then there shall be a place which the 
DEU.12.12	and ye shall rejoice before the 
DEU.12.13	Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest: 
DEU.12.14	but in the place which the 
DEU.12.15	Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the 
DEU.12.16	 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water. 
DEU.12.17	Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand: 
DEU.12.18	but thou must eat them before the 
DEU.12.19	Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.
DEU.12.20	When the 
DEU.12.21	If the place which the 
DEU.12.22	Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat 
DEU.12.23	 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood 
DEU.12.24	Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water. 
DEU.12.25	Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do 
DEU.12.26	Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the 
DEU.12.27	and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the 
DEU.12.28	Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest 
DEU.12.29	When the 
DEU.12.30	take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. 
DEU.12.31	Thou shalt not do so unto the 
DEU.13.1	If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, 
DEU.13.2	and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; 
DEU.13.3	thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the 
DEU.13.4	Ye shall walk after the 
DEU.13.5	And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn 
DEU.13.6	If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which 
DEU.13.7	, of the gods of the people which 
DEU.13.8	thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 
DEU.13.9	but thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. 
DEU.13.10	And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the 
DEU.13.11	And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.
DEU.13.12	If thou shalt hear 
DEU.13.13	 men, the children of Be´li-al, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known; 
DEU.13.14	then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, 
DEU.13.15	thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that 
DEU.13.16	And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the 
DEU.13.17	And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the 
DEU.13.18	when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the 
DEU.14.2	 For thou 
DEU.14.3	Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. 
DEU.14.4	These 
DEU.14.5	the hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois. 
DEU.14.6	And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, 
DEU.14.7	Nevertheless these ye shall not eat, of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; 
DEU.14.8	And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it 
DEU.14.9	These ye shall eat, of all that 
DEU.14.10	and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it 
DEU.14.12	But these 
DEU.14.13	and the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind, 
DEU.14.14	and every raven after his kind, 
DEU.14.15	and the owl, and the nighthawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind, 
DEU.14.16	the little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 
DEU.14.17	and the pelican, and the gier-eagle, and the cormorant, 
DEU.14.18	and the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 
DEU.14.19	And every creeping thing that flieth 
DEU.14.20	 all clean fowls ye may eat.
DEU.14.21	Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
DEU.14.23	And thou shalt eat before the 
DEU.14.24	And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; 
DEU.14.25	then shalt thou turn 
DEU.14.26	and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the 
DEU.14.27	and the Levite that 
DEU.14.28	At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay 
DEU.14.29	and the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which 
DEU.15.1	At the end of 
DEU.15.2	And this 
DEU.15.3	Of a foreigner thou mayest exact 
DEU.15.4	save when there shall be no poor among you; for the 
DEU.15.5	only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.15.6	For the 
DEU.15.8	but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, 
DEU.15.9	Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the 
DEU.15.10	Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the 
DEU.15.11	 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.
DEU.15.13	And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty: 
DEU.15.14	thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: 
DEU.15.15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the 
DEU.15.16	And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee; 
DEU.15.17	then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust 
DEU.15.18	It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant 
DEU.15.20	Thou shalt eat 
DEU.15.21	And if there be 
DEU.15.22	Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean 
DEU.15.23	 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.
DEU.16.2	Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the 
DEU.16.3	Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, 
DEU.16.4	And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there 
DEU.16.5	Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the 
DEU.16.6	but at the place which the 
DEU.16.7	And thou shalt roast and eat 
DEU.16.8	Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day 
DEU.16.10	And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the 
DEU.16.11	and thou shalt rejoice before the 
DEU.16.12	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.
DEU.16.14	and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that 
DEU.16.15	Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the 
DEU.16.16	Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the 
DEU.16.17	every man 
DEU.16.18	Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the 
DEU.16.19	 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous. 
DEU.16.20	That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the 
DEU.16.22	 Neither shalt thou set thee up 
DEU.17.1	Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the 
DEU.17.2	If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the 
DEU.17.3	 and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded; 
DEU.17.4	and it be told thee, and thou hast heard 
DEU.17.5	then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, 
DEU.17.6	 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; 
DEU.17.7	The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.
DEU.17.8	If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, 
DEU.17.9	and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment: 
DEU.17.10	and thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the 
DEU.17.11	according to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall show thee, 
DEU.17.12	And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the 
DEU.17.13	And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
DEU.17.15	thou shalt in any wise set 
DEU.17.16	 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the 
DEU.17.17	 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
DEU.17.18	And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of 
DEU.17.19	and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear the 
DEU.17.20	that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, 
DEU.18.1	The priests the Levites, 
DEU.18.2	 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the 
DEU.18.3	And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether 
DEU.18.4	The firstfruit 
DEU.18.5	For the 
DEU.18.6	And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the 
DEU.18.7	then he shall minister in the name of the 
DEU.18.8	They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.
DEU.18.9	When thou art come into the land which the 
DEU.18.10	 There shall not be found among you 
DEU.18.11	 or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 
DEU.18.12	For all that do these things 
DEU.18.13	 Thou shalt be perfect with the 
DEU.18.14	For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the 
DEU.18.16	according to all that thou desiredst of the 
DEU.18.17	And the 
DEU.18.18	I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. 
DEU.18.19	 And it shall come to pass, 
DEU.18.20	But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die. 
DEU.18.21	And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the 
DEU.18.22	when a prophet speaketh in the name of the 
DEU.19.2	thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the 
DEU.19.3	Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the 
DEU.19.4	And this 
DEU.19.5	as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live: 
DEU.19.6	lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he 
DEU.19.7	Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee. 
DEU.19.8	And if the 
DEU.19.9	if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the 
DEU.19.10	that innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the 
DEU.19.11	But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities; 
DEU.19.12	then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 
DEU.19.13	Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away 
DEU.19.16	If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him 
DEU.19.17	then both the men, between whom the controversy 
DEU.19.18	and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, 
DEU.19.19	then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you. 
DEU.19.20	And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you. 
DEU.19.21	 And thine eye shall not pity; 
DEU.20.1	When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, 
DEU.20.2	And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, 
DEU.20.3	and shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them; 
DEU.20.4	for the 
DEU.20.5	And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man 
DEU.20.6	And what man 
DEU.20.7	And what man 
DEU.20.8	And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man 
DEU.20.9	And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.
DEU.20.10	When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. 
DEU.20.11	And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, 
DEU.20.12	And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: 
DEU.20.13	and when the 
DEU.20.14	but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, 
DEU.20.15	Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities 
DEU.20.16	But of the cities of these people, which the 
DEU.20.17	but thou shalt utterly destroy them; 
DEU.20.18	that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the 
DEU.20.19	When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field 
DEU.20.20	only the trees which thou knowest that they 
DEU.21.1	If 
DEU.21.2	then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which 
DEU.21.3	and it shall be, 
DEU.21.4	and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley. 
DEU.21.5	And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the 
DEU.21.6	and all the elders of that city, 
DEU.21.7	and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen 
DEU.21.8	Be merciful, O 
DEU.21.9	So shalt thou put away the 
DEU.21.10	When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the 
DEU.21.11	and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; 
DEU.21.12	then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; 
DEU.21.13	and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. 
DEU.21.14	And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.
DEU.21.15	If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have borne him children, 
DEU.21.16	then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit 
DEU.21.17	but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated 
DEU.21.18	If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and 
DEU.21.19	then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 
DEU.21.20	and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son 
DEU.21.21	And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
DEU.21.22	And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: 
DEU.21.23	 his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged 
DEU.22.2	And if thy brother 
DEU.22.3	In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost things of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself. 
DEU.22.4	Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift 
DEU.22.5	The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so 
DEU.22.6	If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, 
DEU.22.7	 thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and 
DEU.22.8	When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.
DEU.22.10	Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together. 
DEU.22.11	Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, 
DEU.22.13	If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, 
DEU.22.14	and give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid: 
DEU.22.15	then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth 
DEU.22.16	and the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; 
DEU.22.17	and, lo, he hath given occasions of speech 
DEU.22.18	And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him; 
DEU.22.19	and they shall amerce him in a hundred 
DEU.22.20	But if this thing be true, 
DEU.22.21	then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die; because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.
DEU.22.22	If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, 
DEU.22.23	If a damsel 
DEU.22.24	then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, 
DEU.22.25	But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die: 
DEU.22.26	but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; 
DEU.22.27	for he found her in the field, 
DEU.22.29	then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty 
DEU.23.1	He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.2	A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.4	 because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Ba´laam the son of Be´or of Pethor of Mesopota´mi-a, to curse thee. 
DEU.23.5	 Nevertheless, the 
DEU.23.6	Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.
DEU.23.7	Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he 
DEU.23.8	The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.9	When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.
DEU.23.10	If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp: 
DEU.23.11	but it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash 
DEU.23.12	Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad: 
DEU.23.13	and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee: 
DEU.23.14	for the 
DEU.23.15	Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee: 
DEU.23.16	he shall dwell with thee, 
DEU.23.18	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the 
DEU.23.20	unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the 
DEU.23.22	But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. 
DEU.23.23	That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; 
DEU.23.24	When thou comest into thy neighbor's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put 
DEU.23.25	When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbor, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbor's standing corn.
DEU.24.2	And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's 
DEU.24.3	And 
DEU.24.4	her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that 
DEU.24.5	When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: 
DEU.24.6	No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh 
DEU.24.9	 Remember what the 
DEU.24.11	Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee. 
DEU.24.12	And if the man 
DEU.24.13	in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the 
DEU.24.15	at his day thou shalt give 
DEU.24.18	but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the 
DEU.24.20	When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 
DEU.24.21	When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean 
DEU.24.22	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
DEU.25.1	If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that 
DEU.25.2	And it shall be, if the wicked man 
DEU.25.3	Forty stripes he may give him, 
DEU.25.6	And it shall be, 
DEU.25.7	 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother. 
DEU.25.8	Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and 
DEU.25.9	then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house. 
DEU.25.10	And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.
DEU.25.11	When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: 
DEU.25.12	then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity 
DEU.25.14	thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small: 
DEU.25.15	 thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the 
DEU.25.16	For all that do such things, 
DEU.25.18	how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, 
DEU.25.19	Therefore it shall be, when the 
DEU.26.1	And it shall be, when thou 
DEU.26.2	 that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the 
DEU.26.3	And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the 
DEU.26.4	And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the 
DEU.26.5	And thou shalt speak and say before the 
DEU.26.6	and the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage: 
DEU.26.7	and when we cried unto the 
DEU.26.8	and the 
DEU.26.9	and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, 
DEU.26.10	And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O 
DEU.26.11	and thou shalt rejoice in every good 
DEU.26.13	then thou shalt say before the 
DEU.26.14	I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away 
DEU.26.15	Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
DEU.26.16	This day the 
DEU.26.17	Thou hast avouched the 
DEU.26.18	 and the 
DEU.26.19	and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people unto the 
DEU.27.1	And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day. 
DEU.27.2	 And it shall be, on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the 
DEU.27.3	and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the 
DEU.27.4	Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, 
DEU.27.5	 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the 
DEU.27.6	Thou shalt build the altar of the 
DEU.27.7	and thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the 
DEU.27.8	And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.
DEU.27.9	And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the 
DEU.27.10	Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the 
DEU.27.11	And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, 
DEU.27.12	 These shall stand upon mount Ger´izim to bless the people, when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Is´sachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin: 
DEU.27.13	and these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zeb´ulun, Dan, and Naph´tali. 
DEU.27.14	And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
DEU.27.15	and all the people shall answer and say,
DEU.27.15	Amen.
DEU.27.16	and all the people shall say,
DEU.27.16	Amen.
DEU.27.17	and all the people shall say,
DEU.27.17	Amen.
DEU.27.18	and all the people shall say,
DEU.27.18	Amen.
DEU.27.19	and all the people shall say,
DEU.27.19	Amen.
DEU.27.20	and all the people shall say,
DEU.27.20	Amen.
DEU.27.21	and all the people shall say,
DEU.27.21	Amen.
DEU.27.22	and all the people shall say,
DEU.27.22	Amen.
DEU.27.23	and all the people shall say,
DEU.27.23	Amen.
DEU.27.24	Cursed 
DEU.27.24	and all the people shall say,
DEU.27.24	Amen.

DEU.28.19	Cursed 
DEU.28.19	and cursed 
DEU.28.20	The

DEU.28.30	Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof. 
DEU.28.31	Thine ox 
DEU.28.32	Thy sons and thy daughters 
DEU.28.33	The fruit of thy land, and all thy labors, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway: 
DEU.28.34	so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 
DEU.28.35	The 
DEU.28.36	The 
DEU.28.37	And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the 
DEU.28.38	Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather 
DEU.28.39	Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress 
DEU.28.40	Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint 
DEU.28.41	Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity. 
DEU.28.42	All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume. 
DEU.28.43	The stranger that 
DEU.28.44	He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail. 
DEU.28.45	Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.46	And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.
DEU.28.47	Because thou servedst not the 
DEU.28.48	therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies, which the

DEU.28.56	The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, 
DEU.28.57	 and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all 
DEU.28.58	If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, 
DEU.28.59	then the 
DEU.28.60	Moreover, he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. 
DEU.28.61	Also every sickness, and every plague, which 
DEU.28.62	And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the 
DEU.28.63	And it shall come to pass, 
DEU.28.64	And the 
DEU.28.65	And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the 
DEU.28.66	and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 
DEU.28.67	in the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 
DEU.28.68	And the 
DEU.29.1	These 
DEU.29.2	And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the 
DEU.29.3	the great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles: 
DEU.29.4	yet the 
DEU.29.5	And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot. 
DEU.29.6	Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I 
DEU.29.7	 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them: 
DEU.29.8	 and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manas´seh. 
DEU.29.9	Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
DEU.29.10	Ye stand this day all of you before the 
DEU.29.11	your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that 
DEU.29.12	that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the 
DEU.29.13	that he may establish thee today for a people unto himself, and 
DEU.29.14	Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; 
DEU.29.15	but with 
DEU.29.16	(for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by; 
DEU.29.17	and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which 
DEU.29.18	 lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the 
DEU.29.19	and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination
DEU.29.20	the 
DEU.29.21	And the 
DEU.29.22	so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the 
DEU.29.24	even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the 
DEU.29.25	Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the 
DEU.29.26	for they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and 
DEU.29.27	and the anger of the 
DEU.29.28	and the 
DEU.29.29	The secret 
DEU.30.1	And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call 
DEU.30.2	and shalt return unto the 
DEU.30.3	that then the 
DEU.30.4	If 
DEU.30.5	and the 
DEU.30.6	And the 
DEU.30.7	And the 
DEU.30.8	And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the 
DEU.30.9	And the 
DEU.30.10	if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.30.11	For this commandment which I command thee this day, it 
DEU.30.12	 It 
DEU.30.13	Neither 
DEU.30.14	But the word 
DEU.30.15	See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; 
DEU.30.16	in that I command thee this day to love the 
DEU.30.17	But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 
DEU.30.18	I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, 
DEU.30.19	I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, 
DEU.30.20	 that thou mayest love the 
DEU.31.1	And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. 
DEU.31.2	 And he said unto them, I 
DEU.31.3	The 
DEU.31.4	 And the 
DEU.31.5	And the 
DEU.31.6	Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the 
DEU.31.7	And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the 
DEU.31.8	 And the 
DEU.31.9	And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.10	 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of 
DEU.31.11	when all Israel is come to appear before the 
DEU.31.12	Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that 
DEU.31.13	and 
DEU.31.14	And the 
DEU.31.15	And the 
DEU.31.16	And the 
DEU.31.17	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God 
DEU.31.18	And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods. 
DEU.31.19	Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. 
DEU.31.20	For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant. 
DEU.31.21	And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware. 
DEU.31.22	Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
DEU.31.24	And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 
DEU.31.25	that Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.26	Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.27	For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the 
DEU.31.28	Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them. 
DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt 
DEU.31.30	And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.
DEU.32.1	Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;
DEU.32.1	and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
DEU.32.2	My doctrine shall drop as the rain,
DEU.32.2	my speech shall distil as the dew,
DEU.32.2	as the small rain upon the tender herb,
DEU.32.2	and as the showers upon the grass:
DEU.32.3	because I will publish the name of the 
DEU.32.3	ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
DEU.32.4	for all his ways 
DEU.32.4	a God of truth and without iniquity,
DEU.32.4	just and right 
DEU.32.5	They have corrupted themselves,
DEU.32.5	their spot 
DEU.32.6	Do ye thus requite the 
DEU.32.6	O foolish people and unwise?
DEU.32.6	Hath he not made thee, and established thee?
DEU.32.7	Remember the days of old,
DEU.32.7	consider the years of many generations:
DEU.32.7	ask thy father, and he will show thee;
DEU.32.7	thy elders, and they will tell thee.
DEU.32.8	When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
DEU.32.8	when he separated the sons of Adam,
DEU.32.8	he set the bounds of the people
DEU.32.8	according to the number of the children of Israel.
DEU.32.9	For the 
DEU.32.9	Jacob 
DEU.32.10	He found him in a desert land,
DEU.32.10	and in the waste howling wilderness;
DEU.32.10	he led him about, he instructed him,
DEU.32.10	he kept him as the apple of his eye.
DEU.32.11	As an eagle stirreth up her nest,
DEU.32.11	fluttereth over her young,
DEU.32.11	spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,
DEU.32.11	beareth them on her wings:
DEU.32.12	and 
DEU.32.13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
DEU.32.13	that he might eat the increase of the fields;
DEU.32.13	and he made him to suck honey out of the rock,
DEU.32.13	and oil out of the flinty rock;
DEU.32.14	butter of kine, and milk of sheep,
DEU.32.14	with fat of lambs,
DEU.32.14	and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,
DEU.32.14	with the fat of kidneys of wheat;
DEU.32.14	and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.
DEU.32.15	But Jesh´urun waxed fat, and kicked:
DEU.32.15	thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick,
DEU.32.15	thou art covered 
DEU.32.15	then he forsook God 
DEU.32.15	and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
DEU.32.16	They provoked him to jealousy with strange 
DEU.32.16	with abominations provoked they him to anger.
DEU.32.17	to gods whom they knew not,
DEU.32.17	to new 
DEU.32.17	whom your fathers feared not.
DEU.32.18	Of the Rock 
DEU.32.18	and hast forgotten God that formed thee.
DEU.32.19	And when the 
DEU.32.19	because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.
DEU.32.20	And he said, I will hide my face from them,
DEU.32.20	I will see what their end 
DEU.32.20	for they 
DEU.32.20	children in whom 
DEU.32.21	they have provoked me to anger with their vanities:
DEU.32.21	and I will move them to jealousy with 
DEU.32.21	I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
DEU.32.22	For a fire is kindled in mine anger,
DEU.32.22	and shall burn unto the lowest hell,
DEU.32.22	and shall consume the earth with her increase,
DEU.32.22	and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
DEU.32.23	I will heap mischiefs upon them;
DEU.32.23	I will spend mine arrows upon them.
DEU.32.24	and with bitter destruction:
DEU.32.24	I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them,
DEU.32.24	with the poison of serpents of the dust.
DEU.32.25	The sword without, and terror within,
DEU.32.25	shall destroy both the young man and the virgin,
DEU.32.25	the suckling 
DEU.32.26	I said, I would scatter them into corners,
DEU.32.26	I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:
DEU.32.27	were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy,
DEU.32.27	lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely,
DEU.32.27	and the 
DEU.32.28	For they 
DEU.32.28	neither 
DEU.32.29	O that they were wise, 
DEU.32.30	How should one chase a thousand,
DEU.32.30	and two put ten thousand to flight,
DEU.32.30	except their Rock had sold them,
DEU.32.30	and the 
DEU.32.31	For their rock 
DEU.32.31	even our enemies themselves 
DEU.32.32	For their vine 
DEU.32.32	and of the fields of Gomor´rah:
DEU.32.32	their grapes 
DEU.32.32	their clusters 
DEU.32.33	their wine 
DEU.32.33	and the cruel venom of asps.
DEU.32.35	their foot shall slide in 
DEU.32.35	for the day of their calamity 
DEU.32.35	and the things that shall come upon them make haste.
DEU.32.36	For the 
DEU.32.36	and repent himself for his servants,
DEU.32.36	when he seeth that 
DEU.32.36	and 
DEU.32.37	And he shall say, Where 
DEU.32.38	which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,
DEU.32.38	Let them rise up and help you,
DEU.32.39	See now that I, 
DEU.32.39	and 
DEU.32.39	I kill, and I make alive;
DEU.32.39	I wound, and I heal:
DEU.32.39	neither 
DEU.32.40	For I lift up my hand to heaven,
DEU.32.40	and say, I live for ever.
DEU.32.41	If I whet my glittering sword,
DEU.32.41	and mine hand take hold on judgment;
DEU.32.41	I will render vengeance to mine enemies,
DEU.32.41	and will reward them that hate me.
DEU.32.42	I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,
DEU.32.42	and my sword shall devour flesh;
DEU.32.42	from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
DEU.32.43	for he will avenge the blood of his servants,
DEU.32.43	and will render vengeance to his adversaries,
DEU.32.43	and will be merciful unto his land, 
DEU.32.44	And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshe´a the son of Nun. 
DEU.32.45	And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel: 
DEU.32.46	and he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. 
DEU.32.47	For it 
DEU.32.49	Get thee up into this mountain Ab´arim, 
DEU.32.50	and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: 
DEU.32.51	because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Mer´ibah–Ka´desh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. 
DEU.32.52	Yet thou shalt see the land before 
DEU.33.1	And this 
DEU.33.2	And he said,
DEU.33.2	The 
DEU.33.2	and rose up from Se´ir unto them;
DEU.33.2	he shined forth from mount Paran,
DEU.33.2	and he came with ten thousands of saints:
DEU.33.2	from his right hand 
DEU.33.3	Yea, he loved the people;
DEU.33.3	all his saints 
DEU.33.3	and they sat down at thy feet;
DEU.33.4	Moses commanded us a law,
DEU.33.5	And he was king in Jesh´urun,
DEU.33.5	when the heads of the people 
DEU.33.6	Let Reuben live, and not die;
DEU.33.6	and let 
DEU.33.7	And this 
DEU.33.7	Hear, 
DEU.33.7	and bring him unto his people:
DEU.33.7	let his hands be sufficient for him;
DEU.33.7	and be thou a help 
DEU.33.8	whom thou didst prove at Massah,
DEU.33.9	who said unto his father and to his mother,
DEU.33.9	I have not seen him;
DEU.33.9	neither did he acknowledge his brethren,
DEU.33.9	nor knew his own children:
DEU.33.9	for they have observed thy word,
DEU.33.9	and kept thy covenant.
DEU.33.10	They shall teach Jacob thy judgments,
DEU.33.10	and Israel thy law:
DEU.33.10	they shall put incense before thee,
DEU.33.10	and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.
DEU.33.11	Bless, 
DEU.33.11	and accept the work of his hands:
DEU.33.11	smite through the loins of them that rise against him,
DEU.33.11	and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
DEU.33.12	The beloved of the 
DEU.33.12	and he shall dwell between his shoulders.
DEU.33.13	And of Joseph he said,
DEU.33.13	Blessed of the 
DEU.33.13	for the precious things of heaven, for the dew,
DEU.33.13	and for the deep that coucheth beneath,
DEU.33.14	and for the precious fruits 
DEU.33.14	and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
DEU.33.15	and for the chief things of the ancient mountains,
DEU.33.15	and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
DEU.33.16	and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof,
DEU.33.16	and 
DEU.33.16	let 
DEU.33.16	and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.
DEU.33.17	His glory 
DEU.33.17	and his horns 
DEU.33.17	with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth:
DEU.33.17	and they 
DEU.33.17	and they 
DEU.33.18	And of Zeb´ulun he said,
DEU.33.18	Rejoice, Zeb´ulun, in thy going out;
DEU.33.18	and, Is´sachar, in thy tents.
DEU.33.19	They shall call the people unto the mountain;
DEU.33.19	there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness:
DEU.33.19	for they shall suck 
DEU.33.19	and 
DEU.33.20	And of Gad he said,
DEU.33.20	Blessed 
DEU.33.20	he dwelleth as a lion,
DEU.33.20	and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.
DEU.33.21	And he provided the first part for himself,
DEU.33.21	because there, 
DEU.33.21	and he came with the heads of the people,
DEU.33.21	he executed the justice of the 
DEU.33.21	and his judgments with Israel.
DEU.33.22	And of Dan he said,
DEU.33.22	Dan 
DEU.33.22	he shall leap from Bashan.
DEU.33.23	And of Naph´tali he said,
DEU.33.23	O Naph´tali, satisfied with favor,
DEU.33.23	and full with the blessing of the 
DEU.33.23	possess thou the west and the south.
DEU.33.24	And of Asher he said,
DEU.33.24	let him be acceptable to his brethren,
DEU.33.24	and let him dip his foot in oil.
DEU.33.25	Thy shoes 
DEU.33.25	and as thy days, 
DEU.33.26	and in his excellency on the sky.
DEU.33.27	The eternal God 
DEU.33.27	and underneath 
DEU.33.27	and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee;
DEU.33.27	and shall say, Destroy 
DEU.33.28	Israel then shall dwell in safety alone:
DEU.33.28	the fountain of Jacob 
DEU.33.28	also his heavens shall drop down dew.
DEU.33.29	Happy 
DEU.33.29	who 
DEU.33.29	the shield of thy help,

DEU.34.1	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that 
DEU.34.2	and all Naph´tali, and the land of E´phra-im, and Manas´seh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, 
DEU.34.3	and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zo´ar. 
DEU.34.4	 And the 
DEU.34.5	So Moses the servant of the 
DEU.34.6	And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth–pe´or: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. 
DEU.34.7	And Moses 
DEU.34.8	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping 
DEU.34.9	And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the 
DEU.34.10	 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the 
DEU.34.11	in all the signs and the wonders which the 
DEU.34.12	and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	Now after the death of Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.2	Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, 
JOS.1.3	 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. 
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphra´tes, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. 
JOS.1.5	 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, 
JOS.1.6	 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them. 
JOS.1.7	Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it 
JOS.1.8	This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. 
JOS.1.9	Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the 
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
JOS.1.11	Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the 
JOS.1.13	Remember the word which Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them; 
JOS.1.15	until the 
JOS.1.16	And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. 
JOS.1.17	According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the 
JOS.1.18	Whosoever 
JOS.2.2	And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither tonight of the children of Israel to search out the country. 
JOS.2.3	And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country. 
JOS.2.4	And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they 
JOS.2.5	and it came to pass 
JOS.2.6	But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof. 
JOS.2.7	And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
JOS.2.8	And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof; 
JOS.2.9	and she said unto the men, I know that the 
JOS.2.10	 For we have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	And as soon as we had heard 
JOS.2.12	Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the 
JOS.2.13	and 
JOS.2.14	And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the 
JOS.2.15	Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house 
JOS.2.16	And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way. 
JOS.2.17	And the men said unto her, We 
JOS.2.18	Behold, 
JOS.2.19	And it shall be, 
JOS.2.20	And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. 
JOS.2.21	And she said, According unto your words, so 
JOS.2.22	And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought 
JOS.2.23	So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all 
JOS.2.24	and they said unto Joshua, Truly the 
JOS.3.1	And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over. 
JOS.3.2	And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host; 
JOS.3.3	and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.3.4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed 
JOS.3.5	And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the 
JOS.3.6	And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
JOS.3.7	And the 
JOS.3.8	And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. 
JOS.3.9	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the 
JOS.3.10	And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God 
JOS.3.11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan. 
JOS.3.12	Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man. 
JOS.3.13	And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the 
JOS.3.14	And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people; 
JOS.3.15	and as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,) 
JOS.3.16	that the waters which came down from above stood 
JOS.3.17	And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.1	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the 
JOS.4.2	Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 
JOS.4.3	and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night. 
JOS.4.4	Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 
JOS.4.5	and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the 
JOS.4.6	that this may be a sign among you, 
JOS.4.7	then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.8	And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the 
JOS.4.9	And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day. 
JOS.4.10	For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the 
JOS.4.10	And the people hasted and passed over. 
JOS.4.11	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the 
JOS.4.12	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manas´seh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them: 
JOS.4.13	about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the 
JOS.4.14	On that day the 
JOS.4.15	And the 
JOS.4.16	Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan. 
JOS.4.17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan. 
JOS.4.18	And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.19	And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth 
JOS.4.20	And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal. 
JOS.4.21	And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What 
JOS.4.22	then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. 
JOS.4.23	For the 
JOS.4.24	that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the 
JOS.5.1	And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which 
JOS.5.2	At that time the 
JOS.5.3	And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. 
JOS.5.4	And this 
JOS.5.5	Now all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people 
JOS.5.6	 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people 
JOS.5.7	And their children, 
JOS.5.8	And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole. 
JOS.5.9	And the 
JOS.5.11	And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched 
JOS.5.12	 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
JOS.5.13	And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, 
JOS.5.14	And he said, Nay; but 
JOS.5.15	And the captain of the 
JOS.6.1	Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in. 
JOS.6.2	And the 
JOS.6.3	And ye shall compass the city, all 
JOS.6.4	And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. 
JOS.6.5	And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long 
JOS.6.6	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.7	And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the 
JOS.6.8	And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the 
JOS.6.9	And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rearward came after the ark, 
JOS.6.10	And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall 
JOS.6.11	So the ark of the 
JOS.6.12	And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the 
JOS.6.13	And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.14	And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.
JOS.6.15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the 
JOS.6.17	And the city shall be accursed, 
JOS.6.18	And ye, in any wise keep 
JOS.6.19	But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, 
JOS.6.20	 So the people shouted when 
JOS.6.21	And they utterly destroyed all that 
JOS.6.22	But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her. 
JOS.6.23	And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. 
JOS.6.24	And they burnt the city with fire, and all that 
JOS.6.25	 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel 
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the 
JOS.7.2	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to A´i, which 
JOS.7.3	And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite A´i; 
JOS.7.4	So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; and they fled before the men of A´i. 
JOS.7.5	And the men of A´i smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them 
JOS.7.6	And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the 
JOS.7.7	And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord 
JOS.7.8	O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies! 
JOS.7.9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear 
JOS.7.10	And the 
JOS.7.11	Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put 
JOS.7.12	Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, 
JOS.7.13	Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith the 
JOS.7.14	In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, 
JOS.7.15	And it shall be, 
JOS.7.16	So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 
JOS.7.17	and he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: 
JOS.7.18	and he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. 
JOS.7.19	And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the 
JOS.7.20	And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they 
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, 
JOS.7.23	And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the 
JOS.7.24	And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor. 
JOS.7.25	And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the 
JOS.7.26	And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the 
JOS.8.1	And the 
JOS.8.2	and thou shalt do to A´i and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
JOS.8.3	So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against A´i: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night. 
JOS.8.4	And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, 
JOS.8.5	and I, and all the people that 
JOS.8.6	(for they will come out after us,) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them. 
JOS.8.7	Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the 
JOS.8.8	And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, 
JOS.8.9	Joshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth–el and A´i, on the west side of A´i: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
JOS.8.10	And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to A´i. 
JOS.8.11	And all the people, 
JOS.8.12	And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beth–el and A´i, on the west side of the city. 
JOS.8.13	And when they had set the people, 
JOS.8.14	And it came to pass, when the king of A´i saw 
JOS.8.15	And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 
JOS.8.16	And all the people that 
JOS.8.17	And there was not a man left in A´i or Beth–el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
JOS.8.18	And the 
JOS.8.19	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire. 
JOS.8.20	And when the men of A´i looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. 
JOS.8.21	And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of A´i. 
JOS.8.22	And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. 
JOS.8.23	And the king of A´i they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of A´i in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto A´i, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.8.25	And 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of A´i. 
JOS.8.27	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the 
JOS.8.28	And Joshua burnt A´i, and made it a heap for ever, 
JOS.8.29	And the king of A´i he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, 
JOS.8.31	 as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.8.32	And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 
JOS.8.33	 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.8.34	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among
JOS.9.1	And it came to pass, when all the kings which 
JOS.9.2	that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
JOS.9.3	And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to A´i, 
JOS.9.4	they did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; 
JOS.9.5	and old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry 
JOS.9.6	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us. 
JOS.9.7	 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you? 
JOS.9.8	And they said unto Joshua, We 
JOS.9.9	And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come, because of the name of the 
JOS.9.10	 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that 
JOS.9.11	Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We 
JOS.9.12	This our bread we took hot 
JOS.9.13	and these bottles of wine, which we filled, 
JOS.9.14	And the men took of their victuals, and asked not 
JOS.9.15	And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.
JOS.9.16	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they 
JOS.9.17	And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities 
JOS.9.18	And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the 
JOS.9.19	But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the 
JOS.9.20	This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them. 
JOS.9.21	And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
JOS.9.22	And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We 
JOS.9.23	Now therefore ye 
JOS.9.24	And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the 
JOS.9.25	And now, behold, we 
JOS.9.26	And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. 
JOS.9.27	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the 
JOS.10.1	Now it came to pass, when Ado´ni–ze´dek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken A´i, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to A´i and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them; 
JOS.10.2	that they feared greatly, because Gibeon 
JOS.10.3	Wherefore Ado´ni–ze´dek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhi´a king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
JOS.10.4	Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. 
JOS.10.5	Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
JOS.10.6	And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us. 
JOS.10.7	So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. 
JOS.10.8	And the 
JOS.10.9	Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, 
JOS.10.10	And the 
JOS.10.11	And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, 
JOS.10.12	Then spake Joshua to the 
JOS.10.12	Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;
JOS.10.12	and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aj´alon.
JOS.10.13	until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.
JOS.10.14	And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the 
JOS.10.15	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makke´dah. 
JOS.10.17	And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makke´dah. 
JOS.10.18	And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them: 
JOS.10.19	and stay ye not, 
JOS.10.20	And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest 
JOS.10.21	And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makke´dah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
JOS.10.22	Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave. 
JOS.10.23	And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, 
JOS.10.24	And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. 
JOS.10.25	And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the 
JOS.10.26	And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening. 
JOS.10.27	And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, 
JOS.10.28	And that day Joshua took Makke´dah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that 
JOS.10.29	Then Joshua passed from Makke´dah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah: 
JOS.10.30	and the 
JOS.10.31	And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 
JOS.10.32	and the 
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
JOS.10.34	And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: 
JOS.10.35	and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that 
JOS.10.36	And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it: 
JOS.10.37	and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that 
JOS.10.38	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it: 
JOS.10.39	and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that 
JOS.10.40	So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the 
JOS.10.41	And Joshua smote them from Ka´desh–barne´a even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the 
JOS.10.43	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard 
JOS.11.2	and to the kings that 
JOS.11.3	 the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and 
JOS.11.4	And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that 
JOS.11.5	And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
JOS.11.6	And the 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them. 
JOS.11.8	And the 
JOS.11.9	And Joshua did unto them as the 
JOS.11.10	And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms. 
JOS.11.11	And they smote all the souls that 
JOS.11.12	And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, 
JOS.11.13	But 
JOS.11.14	And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe. 
JOS.11.15	As the 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same; 
JOS.11.17	 from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Se´ir, even unto Ba´al–gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them. 
JOS.11.18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 
JOS.11.19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all 
JOS.11.20	 For it was of the 
JOS.11.21	And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the An´akim from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities. 
JOS.11.22	There was none of the An´akim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained. 
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the 
JOS.12.2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, 
JOS.12.3	and from the plain to the sea of Chin´neroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, 
JOS.12.4	and the coast of Og king of Bashan, 
JOS.12.5	and reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Gesh´urites and the Ma-ach´athites, and half Gil´e-ad, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. 
JOS.12.6	 Them did Moses the servant of the 
JOS.12.7	And these 
JOS.12.8	in the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Per´izzites, the Hivites, and the Jeb´usites: 
JOS.12.9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of A´i, which 
JOS.12.10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
JOS.12.11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
JOS.12.12	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 
JOS.12.13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
JOS.12.14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 
JOS.12.15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adul´lam, one; 
JOS.12.16	the king of Makke´dah, one; the king of Beth–el, one; 
JOS.12.17	the king of Tap´pu-ah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 
JOS.12.18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasha´ron, one; 
JOS.12.19	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 
JOS.12.20	the king of Shim´ron–me´ron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 
JOS.12.21	the king of Ta´anach, one; the king of Megid´do, one; 
JOS.12.22	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jok´ne-am of Carmel, one; 
JOS.12.23	the king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one; 
JOS.12.24	the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.
JOS.13.1	Now Joshua was old 
JOS.13.2	This 
JOS.13.3	from Sihor, which 
JOS.13.4	from the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Me-a´rah that 
JOS.13.5	and the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon toward the sunrising, from Ba´al–gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath. 
JOS.13.6	 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Mis´rephoth–ma´im, 
JOS.13.7	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manas´seh, 
JOS.13.8	 with whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, 
JOS.13.9	from Aro´er, that 
JOS.13.10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon; 
JOS.13.11	and Gil´e-ad, and the border of the Gesh´urites and Ma-ach´athites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 
JOS.13.12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ash´taroth and in Ed´re-i, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out. 
JOS.13.13	Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Gesh´urites, nor the Ma-ach´athites: but the Gesh´urites and the Ma-ach´athites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
JOS.13.15	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben 
JOS.13.16	And their coast was from Aro´er, that 
JOS.13.17	Heshbon, and all her cities that 
JOS.13.18	and Jaha´za, and Kede´moth, and Meph´a-ath, 
JOS.13.19	and Kirjatha´im, and Sibmah, and Za´reth–sha´har in the mount of the valley, 
JOS.13.20	and Beth–pe´or, and Ash´doth–pis´gah, and Beth–jesh´imoth, 
JOS.13.21	and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Mid´i-an, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, 
JOS.13.22	Ba´laam also the son of Be´or, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them. 
JOS.13.23	And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border 
JOS.13.24	And Moses gave 
JOS.13.25	And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gil´e-ad, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aro´er that 
JOS.13.26	and from Heshbon unto Ra´math–miz´peh, and Beto´nim; and from Mahana´im unto the border of Debir; 
JOS.13.27	and in the valley, Beth–a´ram, and Beth–nim´rah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and 
JOS.13.28	This 
JOS.13.29	And Moses gave 
JOS.13.30	And their coast was from Mahana´im, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Ja´ir, which 
JOS.13.31	and half Gil´e-ad, and Ash´taroth, and Ed´re-i, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, 
JOS.13.32	These 
JOS.13.33	 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not 
JOS.14.1	And these 
JOS.14.2	 By lot 
JOS.14.3	 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them. 
JOS.14.4	For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manas´seh and E´phra-im: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell 
JOS.14.5	As the 
JOS.14.7	 Forty years old 
JOS.14.8	Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the 
JOS.14.9	 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the 
JOS.14.10	And now, behold, the 
JOS.14.11	As yet I 
JOS.14.12	Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the 
JOS.14.13	And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephun´neh Hebron for an inheritance. 
JOS.14.14	Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephun´neh the Ken´ezite unto this day; because that he wholly followed the 
JOS.14.15	And the name of Hebron before 
JOS.15.2	And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward: 
JOS.15.3	and it went out to the south side to Ma´aleh–acrab´bim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Ka´desh–barne´a, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Kar´kaa: 
JOS.15.4	 it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast. 
JOS.15.5	And the east border 
JOS.15.6	and the border went up to Beth–hog´la, and passed along by the north of Beth–ar´abah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: 
JOS.15.7	and the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that 
JOS.15.8	and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jeb´usite; the same 
JOS.15.9	and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephto´ah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Ba´alah, which 
JOS.15.10	and the border compassed from Ba´alah westward unto mount Se´ir, and passed along unto the side of mount Je´arim, which 
JOS.15.11	and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Ba´alah, and went out unto Jab´neel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea. 
JOS.15.12	And the west border 
JOS.15.14	And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, She´shai, and Ahi´man, and Tal´mai, the children of Anak. 
JOS.15.15	And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before 
JOS.15.16	And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kir´jath–se´pher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
JOS.15.17	And Oth´ni-el the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
JOS.15.18	And it came to pass, as she came 
JOS.15.19	Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
JOS.15.20	This 
JOS.15.21	And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kab´zeel, and Eder, and Jagur,

JOS.16.4	So the children of Joseph, Manas´seh and E´phra-im, took their inheritance.
JOS.16.5	And the border of the children of E´phra-im according to their families was 
JOS.16.6	and the border went out toward the sea to Mich´methah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Ta´anath–shi´loh, and passed by it on the east to Jano´hah;

JOS.18.6	Ye shall therefore describe the land 
JOS.18.7	But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the

JOS.19.30	Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.31	This 
JOS.19.32	The sixth lot came out to the children of Naph´tali, 
JOS.19.33	And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Za-anan´nim, and Ad´ami, Nekeb, and Jab´neel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan: 
JOS.19.34	and 
JOS.19.35	And the fenced cities

JOS.19.37	and Kedesh, and Ed´re-i, and En–ha´zor, 
JOS.19.38	and Iron, and Mig´dal–el, Horem, and Beth–a´nath, and Beth–she´mesh; nineteen cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.39	This 
JOS.19.41	And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshta´ol, and Ir–she´mesh,

JOS.19.46	and Me–jar´kon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho. 
JOS.19.47	 And the coast of the children of Dan went out 
JOS.19.48	This 
JOS.19.49	When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them: 
JOS.19.50	according to the word of the 
JOS.19.51	These 
JOS.20.2	Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses: 
JOS.20.3	that the slayer that killeth 
JOS.20.4	And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. 
JOS.20.5	And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbor unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime. 
JOS.20.6	And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, 
JOS.20.7	And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naph´tali, and Shechem in mount E´phra-im, and Kir´jath–ar´ba, which 
JOS.20.8	And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gil´e-ad out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manas´seh. 
JOS.20.9	These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth 
JOS.21.1	Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Ele-a´zar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel; 
JOS.21.2	 and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The 
JOS.21.3	And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the 
JOS.21.4	And the lot came out for the families of the Ko´hathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, 
JOS.21.5	And the rest of the children of Kohath 
JOS.21.6	And the children of Gershon 
JOS.21.7	The children of Mera´ri by their families 
JOS.21.8	And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the 
JOS.21.9	And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are 
JOS.21.10	which the children of Aaron, 
JOS.21.11	And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which 
JOS.21.12	But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephun´neh for his possession.
JOS.21.13	Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.14	and Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemo´a with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.15	and Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.16	and A´in with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.17	And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.18	An´athoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.19	All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, 
JOS.21.20	And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of E´phra-im. 
JOS.21.21	For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount E´phra-im, 
JOS.21.22	and Kibza´im with her suburbs, and Beth–ho´ron with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.23	And out of the tribe of Dan, Elte´keh with her suburbs, Gib´bethon with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.24	Ai´jalon with her suburbs, Gath–rim´mon with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.25	And out of the half tribe of Manas´seh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gath–rim´mon with her suburbs; two cities. 
JOS.21.26	All the cities 
JOS.21.27	And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the 
JOS.21.28	And out of the tribe of Is´sachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dab´erath with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth with her suburbs, En–gan´nim with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.30	And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.31	Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.32	And out of the tribe of Naph´tali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.33	All the cities of the Ger´shonites according to their families 
JOS.21.34	And unto the families of the children of Mera´ri, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zeb´ulun, Jok´ne-am with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah with her suburbs, Na´halal with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.36	And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jaha´zah with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.37	Kede´moth with her suburbs, and Meph´a-ath with her suburbs; four cities. 
JOS.21.38	And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gil´e-ad with her suburbs, 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all. 
JOS.21.40	So all the cities for the children of Mera´ri by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were 
JOS.21.41	All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel 
JOS.21.42	These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus 
JOS.21.43	And the 
JOS.21.44	And the 
JOS.21.45	There failed not aught of any good thing which the 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manas´seh, 
JOS.22.2	 and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.3	ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the 
JOS.22.4	And now the 
JOS.22.5	But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.6	So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.
JOS.22.7	Now to the 
JOS.22.8	and he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. 
JOS.22.9	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manas´seh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which 
JOS.22.10	And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that 
JOS.22.11	And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manas´seh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel. 
JOS.22.12	And when the children of Israel heard 
JOS.22.13	And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manas´seh, into the land of Gil´e-ad, Phin´ehas the son of Ele-a´zar the priest, 
JOS.22.14	and with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one 
JOS.22.15	And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manas´seh, unto the land of Gil´e-ad, and they spake with them, saying, 
JOS.22.16	 Thus saith the whole congregation of the 
JOS.22.18	but that ye must turn away this day from following the 
JOS.22.19	Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession 
JOS.22.20	 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
JOS.22.21	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manas´seh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel, 
JOS.22.22	The 
JOS.22.23	that we have built us an altar to turn from following the 
JOS.22.24	and if we have not 
JOS.22.25	For the 
JOS.22.26	Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice: 
JOS.22.27	but 
JOS.22.28	Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should 
JOS.22.29	God forbid that we should rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	And when Phin´ehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which 
JOS.22.31	And Phin´ehas the son of Ele-a´zar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manas´seh, This day we perceive that the 
JOS.22.32	And Phin´ehas the son of Ele-a´zar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gil´e-ad, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. 
JOS.22.33	And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt. 
JOS.22.34	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar 
JOS.23.1	And it came to pass, a long time after that the 
JOS.23.2	And Joshua called for all Israel, 
JOS.23.3	and ye have seen all that the 
JOS.23.4	Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward. 
JOS.23.5	And the 
JOS.23.6	Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom 
JOS.23.7	that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear 
JOS.23.8	but cleave unto the 
JOS.23.9	For the 
JOS.23.10	 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the 
JOS.23.11	Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the 
JOS.23.12	Else, if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, 
JOS.23.13	know for a certainty that the 
JOS.23.14	And, behold, this day I 
JOS.23.15	Therefore it shall come to pass, 
JOS.23.16	When ye have transgressed the covenant of the 
JOS.24.1	And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God. 
JOS.24.2	 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the 
JOS.24.3	 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. 
JOS.24.4	 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Se´ir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. 
JOS.24.5	 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out. 
JOS.24.6	 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea. 
JOS.24.7	And when they cried unto the 
JOS.24.8	 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you. 
JOS.24.9	 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Ba´laam the son of Be´or to curse you: 
JOS.24.10	but I would not hearken unto Ba´laam, therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand. 
JOS.24.11	 And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Per´izzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Gir´gashites, the Hivites, and the Jeb´usites; and I delivered them into your hand. 
JOS.24.12	 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, 
JOS.24.13	 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
JOS.24.14	Now therefore fear the 
JOS.24.15	And if it seem evil unto you to serve the 
JOS.24.16	And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the 
JOS.24.17	for the 
JOS.24.18	and the 
JOS.24.19	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the 
JOS.24.20	If ye forsake the 
JOS.24.21	And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the 
JOS.24.22	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye 
JOS.24.23	Now therefore put away, 
JOS.24.24	And the people said unto Joshua, The 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 
JOS.24.26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that 
JOS.24.27	And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the 
JOS.24.28	So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
JOS.24.29	And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JOS.24.30	 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Tim´nath–se´rah, which 
JOS.24.31	And Israel served the 
JOS.24.33	And Ele-a´zar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill 
JDG.1.1	Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the 
JDG.1.2	And the 
JDG.1.3	And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him. 
JDG.1.4	And Judah went up; and the 
JDG.1.5	And they found Adon´i–be´zek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Per´izzites. 
JDG.1.6	But Adon´i–be´zek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. 
JDG.1.7	And Adon´i–be´zek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered 
JDG.1.8	Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. 
JDG.1.9	And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley. 
JDG.1.10	And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: now the name of Hebron before 
JDG.1.11	And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before 
JDG.1.12	and Caleb said, He that smiteth Kir´jath–se´pher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
JDG.1.13	And Oth´ni-el the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
JDG.1.14	And it came to pass, when she came 
JDG.1.15	And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
JDG.1.16	And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which 
JDG.1.17	And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah. 
JDG.1.18	Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Ash´kelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. 
JDG.1.19	And the 
JDG.1.20	 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak. 
JDG.1.21	 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jeb´usites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jeb´usites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
JDG.1.22	And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth–el: and the 
JDG.1.23	And the house of Joseph sent to descry Beth–el. (Now the name of the city before 
JDG.1.24	And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy. 
JDG.1.25	And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family. 
JDG.1.26	And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which 
JDG.1.28	And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
JDG.1.30	Neither did Zeb´ulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Na´halol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
JDG.1.31	Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob: 
JDG.1.32	but the Ash´erites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
JDG.1.33	Neither did Naph´tali drive out the inhabitants of Beth–she´mesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth–a´nath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth–she´mesh and of Beth–a´nath became tributaries unto them.
JDG.1.34	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: 
JDG.1.35	but the Amorites would dwell in mount Her´es in Ai´jalon, and in Sha-al´bim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries. 
JDG.1.36	And the coast of the Amorites 
JDG.2.1	And an angel of the 
JDG.2.2	 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice; why have ye done this? 
JDG.2.3	Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be 
JDG.2.4	And it came to pass, when the angel of the 
JDG.2.5	And they called the name of that place Bochim:
JDG.2.6	And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. 
JDG.2.7	And the people served the 
JDG.2.8	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JDG.2.9	 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Tim´nath–he´res, in the mount of E´phra-im, on the north side of the hill Ga´ash. 
JDG.2.10	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the 
JDG.2.11	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.2.12	and they forsook the 
JDG.2.13	And they forsook the 
JDG.2.14	And the anger of the 
JDG.2.15	Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the 
JDG.2.16	Nevertheless the 
JDG.2.17	And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the 
JDG.2.18	And when the 
JDG.2.19	And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, 
JDG.2.20	And the anger of the 
JDG.2.21	I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died: 
JDG.2.22	that through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the 
JDG.2.23	Therefore the 
JDG.3.1	Now these 
JDG.3.2	only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 
JDG.3.3	, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sido´nians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Ba´al–her´mon unto the entering in of Hamath. 
JDG.3.4	And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the 
JDG.3.5	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Per´izzites, and Hivites, and Jeb´usites: 
JDG.3.6	and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
JDG.3.7	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.3.8	Therefore the anger of the 
JDG.3.9	And when the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.3.10	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	And the land had rest forty years: and Oth´ni-el the son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the 
JDG.3.13	And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Am´alek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees. 
JDG.3.14	So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	But when the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.3.16	But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. 
JDG.3.17	And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon 
JDG.3.18	And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. 
JDG.3.19	But he himself turned again from the quarries that 
JDG.3.20	And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of 
JDG.3.21	And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 
JDG.3.22	and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlor upon him, and locked them.
JDG.3.24	When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor 
JDG.3.25	And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlor; therefore they took a key, and opened 
JDG.3.26	And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Se-i´rath. 
JDG.3.27	And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of E´phra-im, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them. 
JDG.3.28	And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the 
JDG.3.29	And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor; and there escaped not a man. 
JDG.3.30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
JDG.3.31	And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad: and he also delivered Israel.
JDG.4.1	And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.4.2	And the 
JDG.4.3	And the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.4.4	And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lap´idoth, she judged Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth–el in mount E´phra-im: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
JDG.4.6	And she sent and called Barak the son of Abin´o-am out of Kedesh–naph´tali, and said unto him, Hath not the 
JDG.4.7	And I will draw unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sis´era the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. 
JDG.4.8	And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, 
JDG.4.9	And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for the 
JDG.4.10	And Barak called Zeb´ulun and Naph´tali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite, 
JDG.4.12	And they showed Sis´era that Barak the son of Abin´o-am was gone up to mount Tabor. 
JDG.4.13	And Sis´era gathered together all his chariots, 
JDG.4.14	And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this 
JDG.4.15	And the 
JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Haro´sheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sis´era fell upon the edge of the sword; 
JDG.4.17	Howbeit Sis´era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja´el the wife of Heber the Kenite: for 
JDG.4.18	And Ja´el went out to meet Sis´era, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. 
JDG.4.19	And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. 
JDG.4.20	Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No. 
JDG.4.21	Then Ja´el Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died. 
JDG.4.22	And, behold, as Barak pursued Sis´era, Ja´el came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her 
JDG.4.23	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. 
JDG.4.24	And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
JDG.5.1	Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abin´o-am on that day, saying,
JDG.5.2	Praise ye the 
JDG.5.2	when the people willingly offered themselves.
JDG.5.3	Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes;
JDG.5.3	I, 
JDG.5.3	I will sing 
JDG.5.4	when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom,
JDG.5.4	the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped,
JDG.5.4	the clouds also dropped water.
JDG.5.6	In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,
JDG.5.6	in the days of Ja´el,
JDG.5.6	the highways were unoccupied,
JDG.5.6	and the travelers walked through byways.
JDG.5.7	they ceased in Israel,
JDG.5.7	until that I Deborah arose,
JDG.5.7	that I arose a mother in Israel.
JDG.5.8	They chose new gods;
JDG.5.8	then 
JDG.5.8	was there a shield or spear seen
JDG.5.8	among forty thousand in Israel?
JDG.5.9	My heart 
JDG.5.9	that offered themselves willingly among the people.
JDG.5.9	Bless ye the 
JDG.5.10	Speak, ye that ride on white asses,
JDG.5.10	ye that sit in judgment,
JDG.5.10	and walk by the way.
JDG.5.11	there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the 
JDG.5.11	then shall the people of the 
JDG.5.12	Awake, awake, Deborah:
JDG.5.12	awake, awake, utter a song:
JDG.5.12	arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive,
JDG.5.12	thou son of Abin´o-am.
JDG.5.13	Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people:
JDG.5.13	the 
JDG.5.14	Out of E´phra-im 
JDG.5.14	after thee, Benjamin, among thy people;
JDG.5.14	out of Machir came down governors,
JDG.5.14	and out of Zeb´ulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
JDG.5.15	And the princes of Is´sachar 
JDG.5.15	even Is´sachar, and also Barak:
JDG.5.15	he was sent on foot into the valley.
JDG.5.15	For the divisions of Reuben
JDG.5.16	Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds,
JDG.5.16	to hear the bleatings of the flocks?
JDG.5.16	For the divisions of Reuben
JDG.5.17	Gil´e-ad abode beyond Jordan:
JDG.5.17	and why did Dan remain in ships?
JDG.5.17	Asher continued on the seashore,
JDG.5.17	and abode in his breaches.
JDG.5.18	Zeb´ulun and Naph´tali 
JDG.5.19	The kings came 
JDG.5.19	then fought the kings of Canaan
JDG.5.19	in Ta´anach by the waters of Megid´do;
JDG.5.19	they took no gain of money.
JDG.5.20	They fought from heaven;
JDG.5.20	the stars in their courses fought against Sis´era.
JDG.5.21	The river of Kishon swept them away,
JDG.5.21	that ancient river, the river Kishon.
JDG.5.21	O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.
JDG.5.22	Then were the horsehoofs broken
JDG.5.22	by the means of the prancings,
JDG.5.22	the prancings of their mighty ones.
JDG.5.23	Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the 
JDG.5.23	curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof;
JDG.5.23	because they came not to the help of the 
JDG.5.23	to the help of the 
JDG.5.24	Blessed above women shall Ja´el the wife of Heber the Kenite be;
JDG.5.24	blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
JDG.5.25	He asked water, 
JDG.5.25	she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
JDG.5.26	She put her hand to the nail,
JDG.5.26	and her right hand to the workmen's hammer;
JDG.5.26	and with the hammer she smote Sis´era, she smote off his head,
JDG.5.26	when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.
JDG.5.27	At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down:
JDG.5.27	at her feet he bowed, he fell:
JDG.5.27	where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
JDG.5.28	The mother of Sis´era looked out at a window,
JDG.5.28	and cried through the lattice,
JDG.5.28	Why is his chariot 
JDG.5.28	Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
JDG.5.29	Her wise ladies answered her,
JDG.5.29	yea, she returned answer to herself,
JDG.5.30	Have they not sped? have they 
JDG.5.30	to every man a damsel 
JDG.5.30	to Sis´era a prey of divers colors,
JDG.5.30	a prey of divers colors of needlework,
JDG.5.30	of divers colors of needlework on both sides,
JDG.5.31	So let all thine enemies perish, O 
JDG.5.31	but 
JDG.5.31	And the land had rest forty years.
JDG.6.1	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.6.2	And the hand of Mid´i-an prevailed against Israel: 
JDG.6.3	And 
JDG.6.4	and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. 
JDG.6.5	For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; 
JDG.6.6	And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Mid´i-anites; and the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.6.7	And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.6.8	that the 
JDG.6.9	and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land; 
JDG.6.10	and I said unto you, I 
JDG.6.11	And there came an angel of the 
JDG.6.12	And the angel of the 
JDG.6.13	And Gideon said unto him, O my Lord, if the 
JDG.6.14	And the 
JDG.6.15	And he said unto him, O my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family 
JDG.6.16	And the 
JDG.6.17	And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me. 
JDG.6.18	Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set 
JDG.6.19	And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought 
JDG.6.20	And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay 
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of the 
JDG.6.22	And when Gideon perceived that he 
JDG.6.23	And the 
JDG.6.24	Then Gideon built an altar there unto the 
JDG.6.25	And it came to pass the same night, that the 
JDG.6.26	and build an altar unto the 
JDG.6.27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the 
JDG.6.28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Ba´al was cast down, and the grove was cut down that 
JDG.6.29	And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Jo´ash hath done this thing. 
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the city said unto Jo´ash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Ba´al, and because he hath cut down the grove that 
JDG.6.31	And Jo´ash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Ba´al? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst 
JDG.6.32	Therefore on that day he called him Jerubba´al,
JDG.6.33	Then all the Mid´i-anites and the Amal´ekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. 
JDG.6.34	But the Spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manas´seh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zeb´ulun, and unto Naph´tali; and they came up to meet them.
JDG.6.36	And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, 
JDG.6.37	behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; 
JDG.6.38	And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. 
JDG.6.39	And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. 
JDG.6.40	And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
JDG.7.1	Then Jerubba´al, who 
JDG.7.2	And the 
JDG.7.3	 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever 
JDG.7.4	And the 
JDG.7.5	So he brought down the people unto the water: and the 
JDG.7.6	And the number of them that lapped, 
JDG.7.7	And the 
JDG.7.8	So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all 
JDG.7.9	And it came to pass the same night, that the 
JDG.7.10	But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host: 
JDG.7.11	and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that 
JDG.7.12	And the Mid´i-anites and the Amal´ekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels 
JDG.7.13	And when Gideon was come, behold, 
JDG.7.14	And his fellow answered and said, This 
JDG.7.15	And it was 
JDG.7.16	And he divided the three hundred men 
JDG.7.17	And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be 
JDG.7.18	When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that 
JDG.7.19	So Gideon, and the hundred men that 
JDG.7.20	And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow 
JDG.7.21	And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled. 
JDG.7.22	And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the 
JDG.7.23	And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naph´tali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manas´seh, and pursued after the Mid´i-anites.
JDG.7.24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount E´phra-im, saying, Come down against the Mid´i-anites, and take before them the waters unto Beth–ba´rah and Jordan. Then all the men of E´phra-im gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth–ba´rah and Jordan. 
JDG.7.25	And they took two princes of the Mid´i-anites, Oreb and Ze´eb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Ze´eb they slew at the winepress of Ze´eb, and pursued Mid´i-an, and brought the heads of Oreb and Ze´eb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.
JDG.8.1	And the men of E´phra-im said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Mid´i-anites? And they did chide with him sharply. 
JDG.8.2	And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? 
JDG.8.3	God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Mid´i-an, Oreb and Ze´eb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
JDG.8.4	And Gideon came to Jordan, 
JDG.8.5	And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they 
JDG.8.6	And the princes of Succoth said, 
JDG.8.7	And Gideon said, Therefore when the 
JDG.8.8	And he went up thence to Penu´el, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penu´el answered him as the men of Succoth had answered 
JDG.8.9	And he spake also unto the men of Penu´el, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmun´na 
JDG.8.11	And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jog´behah, and smote the host: for the host was secure. 
JDG.8.12	And when Zebah and Zalmun´na fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Mid´i-an, Zebah and Zalmun´na, and discomfited all the host.
JDG.8.13	And Gideon the son of Jo´ash returned from battle before the sun 
JDG.8.14	and caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, 
JDG.8.15	And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmun´na, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, 
JDG.8.16	And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness, and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. 
JDG.8.17	And he beat down the tower of Penu´el, and slew the men of the city.
JDG.8.18	Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmun´na, What manner of men 
JDG.8.19	And he said, They 
JDG.8.20	And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, 
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmun´na said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man 
JDG.8.22	Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Mid´i-an. 
JDG.8.23	And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the 
JDG.8.24	And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they 
JDG.8.25	And they answered, We will willingly give 
JDG.8.26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred 
JDG.8.27	And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, 
JDG.8.28	Thus was Mid´i-an subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
JDG.8.29	And Jerubba´al the son of Jo´ash went and dwelt in his own house. 
JDG.8.30	And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	And his concubine that 
JDG.8.32	And Gideon the son of Jo´ash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Jo´ash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ez´rites.
JDG.8.33	And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Ba´alim, and made Ba´al–be´rith their god. 
JDG.8.34	And the children of Israel remembered not the 
JDG.8.35	neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubba´al, 
JDG.9.1	And Abim´elech the son of Jerubba´al went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying, 
JDG.9.2	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether 
JDG.9.3	And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abim´elech; for they said, He 
JDG.9.4	And they gave him threescore and ten 
JDG.9.5	And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubba´al, 
JDG.9.6	And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abim´elech king, by the plain of the pillar that 
JDG.9.7	And when they told 
JDG.9.8	The trees went forth 
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? 
JDG.9.10	And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, 
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees? 
JDG.9.12	Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, 
JDG.9.13	And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? 
JDG.9.14	Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, 
JDG.9.15	And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, 
JDG.9.16	Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abim´elech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubba´al and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands: 
JDG.9.17	(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Mid´i-an: 
JDG.9.18	and ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abim´elech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he 
JDG.9.19	if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubba´al and with his house this day, 
JDG.9.20	but if not, let fire come out from Abim´elech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abim´elech. 
JDG.9.21	And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abim´elech his brother.
JDG.9.22	When Abim´elech had reigned three years over Israel, 
JDG.9.23	then God sent an evil spirit between Abim´elech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abim´elech: 
JDG.9.24	that the cruelty 
JDG.9.25	And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abim´elech.
JDG.9.26	And Ga´al the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. 
JDG.9.27	And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode 
JDG.9.28	And Ga´al the son of Ebed said, Who 
JDG.9.29	And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abim´elech. And he said to Abim´elech, Increase thine army, and come out.
JDG.9.30	And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Ga´al the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. 
JDG.9.31	And he sent messengers unto Abim´elech privily, saying, Behold, Ga´al the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee. 
JDG.9.32	Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that 
JDG.9.33	and it shall be, 
JDG.9.34	And Abim´elech rose up, and all the people that 
JDG.9.35	And Ga´al the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abim´elech rose up, and the people that 
JDG.9.36	And when Ga´al saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as 
JDG.9.37	And Ga´al spake again and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Me-o´nenim. 
JDG.9.38	Then said Zebul unto him, Where 
JDG.9.39	And Ga´al went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abim´elech. 
JDG.9.40	And Abim´elech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown 
JDG.9.41	And Abim´elech dwelt at Aru´mah: and Zebul thrust out Ga´al and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
JDG.9.42	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abim´elech. 
JDG.9.43	And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people 
JDG.9.44	And Abim´elech, and the company that 
JDG.9.45	And Abim´elech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that 
JDG.9.46	And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard 
JDG.9.47	And it was told Abim´elech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 
JDG.9.48	And Abim´elech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that 
JDG.9.49	And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abim´elech, and put 
JDG.9.50	Then went Abim´elech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut 
JDG.9.52	And Abim´elech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
JDG.9.53	And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abim´elech's head, and all to brake his skull. 
JDG.9.54	Then he called hastily unto the young man his armor-bearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abim´elech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. 
JDG.9.56	Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abim´elech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 
JDG.9.57	and all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubba´al.
JDG.10.1	And after Abim´elech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Pu´ah, the son of Dodo, a man of Is´sachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount E´phra-im. 
JDG.10.2	And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	And after him arose Ja´ir, a Gil´e-adite, and judged Israel twenty and two years. 
JDG.10.4	And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth–ja´ir unto this day, which 
JDG.10.5	And Ja´ir died, and was buried in Camon.
JDG.10.6	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the 
JDG.10.7	And the anger of the 
JDG.10.8	And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that 
JDG.10.9	Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of E´phra-im; so that Israel was sore distressed.
JDG.10.10	And the children of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.10.11	And the 
JDG.10.12	The Zido´ni-ans also, and the Amal´ekites, and the Ma´onites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand. 
JDG.10.13	Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. 
JDG.10.15	And the children of Israel said unto the 
JDG.10.16	And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the 
JDG.10.17	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gil´e-ad. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh. 
JDG.10.18	And the people 
JDG.11.1	Now Jephthah the Gil´e-adite was a mighty man of valor, and he 
JDG.11.2	And Gil´e-ad's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou 
JDG.11.3	Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.
JDG.11.4	And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel. 
JDG.11.5	And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gil´e-ad went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob: 
JDG.11.6	and they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon. 
JDG.11.7	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gil´e-ad, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress? 
JDG.11.8	And the elders of Gil´e-ad said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gil´e-ad. 
JDG.11.9	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gil´e-ad, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the 
JDG.11.10	And the elders of Gil´e-ad said unto Jephthah, The 
JDG.11.11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gil´e-ad, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the 
JDG.11.12	And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land? 
JDG.11.13	And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those 
JDG.11.14	And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon: 
JDG.11.15	and said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon: 
JDG.11.16	but when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; 
JDG.11.17	 then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken 
JDG.11.18	 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon 
JDG.11.19	 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place. 
JDG.11.20	But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
JDG.11.21	And the 
JDG.11.22	And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan. 
JDG.11.23	So now the 
JDG.11.24	Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the 
JDG.11.25	 And now 
JDG.11.26	while Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aro´er and her towns, and in all the cities that 
JDG.11.27	Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the 
JDG.11.28	Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
JDG.11.29	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.11.30	And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the 
JDG.11.31	then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the 
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the 
JDG.11.33	And he smote them from Aro´er, even till thou come to Minnith, 
JDG.11.34	And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she 
JDG.11.35	 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the 
JDG.11.36	And she said unto him, My father, 
JDG.11.37	And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows. 
JDG.11.38	And he said, Go. And he sent her away 
JDG.11.39	And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her 
JDG.11.40	 the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gil´e-adite four days in a year.
JDG.12.1	And the men of E´phra-im gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire. 
JDG.12.2	And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands. 
JDG.12.3	And when I saw that ye delivered 
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gil´e-ad, and fought with E´phra-im: and the men of Gil´e-ad smote E´phra-im, because they said, Ye Gil´e-adites 
JDG.12.5	And the Gil´e-adites took the passages of Jordan before the E´phra-imites: and it was 
JDG.12.6	then said they unto him, Say now Shib´boleth: and he said Sib´boleth: for he could not frame to pronounce 
JDG.12.7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gil´e-adite, and was buried in 
JDG.12.8	And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
JDG.12.9	And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, 
JDG.12.10	Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	And after him Elon, a Zeb´ulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. 
JDG.12.12	And Elon the Zeb´ulonite died, and was buried in Ai´jalon in the country of Zeb´ulun.
JDG.12.13	And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pira´thonite, judged Israel. 
JDG.12.14	And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years. 
JDG.12.15	And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pira´thonite died, and was buried in Pira´thon in the land of E´phra-im, in the mount of the Amal´ekites.
JDG.13.1	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the 
JDG.13.2	And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name 
JDG.13.3	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.4	Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean 
JDG.13.5	 for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. 
JDG.13.6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance 
JDG.13.7	but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean 
JDG.13.8	Then Mano´ah entreated the 
JDG.13.9	And God hearkened to the voice of Mano´ah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Mano´ah her husband 
JDG.13.10	And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the 
JDG.13.11	And Mano´ah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, 
JDG.13.12	And Mano´ah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and 
JDG.13.13	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.14	She may not eat of any 
JDG.13.15	And Mano´ah said unto the angel of the 
JDG.13.16	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.17	And Mano´ah said unto the angel of the 
JDG.13.18	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.19	So Mano´ah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered 
JDG.13.20	For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the 
JDG.13.21	But the angel of the 
JDG.13.22	And Mano´ah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. 
JDG.13.23	But his wife said unto him, If the 
JDG.13.24	And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the 
JDG.13.25	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.1	And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. 
JDG.14.2	And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. 
JDG.14.3	Then his father and his mother said unto him, 
JDG.14.4	But his father and his mother knew not that it 
JDG.14.5	Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him. 
JDG.14.6	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.7	And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. 
JDG.14.8	And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, 
JDG.14.9	And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.
JDG.14.10	So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. 
JDG.14.11	And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. 
JDG.14.12	And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find 
JDG.14.13	but if ye cannot declare 
JDG.14.14	And he said unto them,
JDG.14.14	Out of the eater came forth meat,
JDG.14.14	and out of the strong came forth sweetness.
JDG.14.14	And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
JDG.14.15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? 
JDG.14.16	And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told 
JDG.14.17	And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people. 
JDG.14.18	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down,
JDG.14.18	What 
JDG.14.18	And what 
JDG.14.18	And he said unto them,
JDG.14.18	If ye had not plowed with my heifer,
JDG.14.18	ye had not found out my riddle.
JDG.14.19	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.20	But Samson's wife was 
JDG.15.1	But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in. 
JDG.15.2	And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: 
JDG.15.3	And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. 
JDG.15.4	And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails. 
JDG.15.5	And when he had set the brands on fire, he let 
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. 
JDG.15.7	And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease. 
JDG.15.8	And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.
JDG.15.9	Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us. 
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines 
JDG.15.12	And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves. 
JDG.15.13	And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
JDG.15.15	And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith. 
JDG.15.16	And Samson said,
JDG.15.16	With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
JDG.15.16	with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
JDG.15.17	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ra´math–le´hi.
JDG.15.18	And he was sore athirst, and called on the 
JDG.15.19	But God clave a hollow place that 
JDG.15.20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
JDG.16.1	Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in unto her. 
JDG.16.2	 the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed 
JDG.16.3	And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put 
JDG.16.4	And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name 
JDG.16.5	And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength 
JDG.16.6	And Deli´lah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength 
JDG.16.7	And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. 
JDG.16.8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. 
JDG.16.9	Now 
JDG.16.10	And Deli´lah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. 
JDG.16.11	And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied,
JDG.16.12	Deli´lah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines 
JDG.16.13	And Deli´lah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. 
JDG.16.14	And she fastened 
JDG.16.15	And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart 
JDG.16.16	And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, 
JDG.16.17	that he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I 
JDG.16.18	And when Deli´lah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand. 
JDG.16.19	And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. 
JDG.16.20	And she said, The Philistines 
JDG.16.21	But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house. 
JDG.16.22	Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
JDG.16.23	Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. 
JDG.16.24	And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us. 
JDG.16.25	And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars. 
JDG.16.26	And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. 
JDG.16.27	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines 
JDG.16.28	And Samson called unto the 
JDG.16.29	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left. 
JDG.16.30	And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with 
JDG.16.31	Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought 
JDG.17.1	And there was a man of mount E´phra-im, whose name 
JDG.17.2	And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred 
JDG.17.3	And when he had restored the eleven hundred 
JDG.17.4	Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred 
JDG.17.5	And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. 
JDG.17.6	 In those days 
JDG.17.7	And there was a young man out of Beth–lehem–judah of the family of Judah, who 
JDG.17.8	And the man departed out of the city from Beth–lehem–judah to sojourn where he could find 
JDG.17.9	And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I 
JDG.17.10	And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten 
JDG.17.11	And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. 
JDG.17.12	And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.13	Then said Micah, Now know I that the 
JDG.18.1	In those days 
JDG.18.2	And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshta´ol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount E´phra-im, to the house of Micah, they lodged there. 
JDG.18.3	When they 
JDG.18.4	And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest. 
JDG.18.5	And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous. 
JDG.18.6	And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the 
JDG.18.7	Then the five men departed, and came to La´ish, and saw the people that 
JDG.18.8	And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshta´ol: and their brethren said unto them, What 
JDG.18.9	And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it 
JDG.18.10	When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where 
JDG.18.11	And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshta´ol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war. 
JDG.18.12	And they went up, and pitched in Kir´jath–je´arim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Ma´haneh–dan unto this day: behold, 
JDG.18.13	And they passed thence unto mount E´phra-im, and came unto the house of Micah.
JDG.18.14	Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of La´ish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do. 
JDG.18.15	And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, 
JDG.18.16	And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which 
JDG.18.17	And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, 
JDG.18.18	And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye? 
JDG.18.19	And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: 
JDG.18.20	And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
JDG.18.21	So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them. 
JDG.18.22	 when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that 
JDG.18.23	And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company? 
JDG.18.24	And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what 
JDG.18.25	And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household. 
JDG.18.26	And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they 
JDG.18.27	And they took 
JDG.18.28	And 
JDG.18.29	And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city 
JDG.18.30	And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manas´seh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. 
JDG.18.31	And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	And it came to pass in those days, when 
JDG.19.2	And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth–lehem–judah, and was there four whole months. 
JDG.19.3	And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, 
JDG.19.4	And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there. 
JDG.19.5	And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way. 
JDG.19.6	And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry. 
JDG.19.7	And when the man rose up to depart, his father-in-law urged him: therefore he lodged there again. 
JDG.19.8	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them. 
JDG.19.9	And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
JDG.19.10	But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which 
JDG.19.11	 when they 
JDG.19.12	And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that 
JDG.19.13	And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gib´e-ah, or in Ramah. 
JDG.19.14	And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them 
JDG.19.15	And they turned aside thither, to go in 
JDG.19.16	And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which 
JDG.19.17	And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou? 
JDG.19.18	And he said unto him, We 
JDG.19.19	Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man 
JDG.19.20	And the old man said, Peace 
JDG.19.21	So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
JDG.19.23	And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, 
JDG.19.24	Behold, 
JDG.19.25	But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go. 
JDG.19.26	Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord 
JDG.19.27	And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down 
JDG.19.28	And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her 
JDG.19.29	And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, 
JDG.19.30	And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak 
JDG.20.1	Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beer–sheba, with the land of Gil´e-ad, unto the 
JDG.20.2	And the chief of all the people, 
JDG.20.3	(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell 
JDG.20.4	And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gib´e-ah that 
JDG.20.5	And the men of Gib´e-ah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, 
JDG.20.6	And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	Behold, ye 
JDG.20.8	And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any 
JDG.20.9	But now this 
JDG.20.10	and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gib´e-ah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel. 
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
JDG.20.12	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness 
JDG.20.13	Now therefore deliver 
JDG.20.14	but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gib´e-ah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel. 
JDG.20.15	And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gib´e-ah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men. 
JDG.20.16	Among all this people 
JDG.20.17	And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these 
JDG.20.18	And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the 
JDG.20.19	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gib´e-ah. 
JDG.20.20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gib´e-ah. 
JDG.20.21	And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gib´e-ah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men. 
JDG.20.22	And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day. 
JDG.20.23	(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the 
JDG.20.24	And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. 
JDG.20.25	And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gib´e-ah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. 
JDG.20.26	Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the 
JDG.20.27	And the children of Israel inquired of the 
JDG.20.28	and Phin´ehas, the son of Ele-a´zar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the 
JDG.20.29	And Israel set liers in wait round about Gib´e-ah. 
JDG.20.30	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gib´e-ah, as at other times. 
JDG.20.31	And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, 
JDG.20.32	And the children of Benjamin said, They 
JDG.20.33	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Ba´al–ta´mar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, 
JDG.20.34	And there came against Gib´e-ah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil 
JDG.20.35	And the 
JDG.20.36	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gib´e-ah. 
JDG.20.37	And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gib´e-ah; and the liers in wait drew 
JDG.20.38	Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city. 
JDG.20.39	And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite 
JDG.20.40	But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven. 
JDG.20.41	And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them. 
JDG.20.42	Therefore they turned 
JDG.20.43	 they inclosed the Benjamites round about, 
JDG.20.44	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these 
JDG.20.45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them. 
JDG.20.46	So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these 
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months. 
JDG.20.48	And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of 
JDG.21.1	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife. 
JDG.21.2	And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore; 
JDG.21.3	and said, O 
JDG.21.4	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 
JDG.21.5	And the children of Israel said, Who 
JDG.21.6	And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day. 
JDG.21.7	How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the 
JDG.21.8	And they said, What one 
JDG.21.9	For the people were numbered, and, behold, 
JDG.21.10	And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Ja´besh–gil´e-ad with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children. 
JDG.21.11	And this 
JDG.21.12	And they found among the inhabitants of Ja´besh–gil´e-ad four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which 
JDG.21.13	And the whole congregation sent 
JDG.21.14	And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Ja´besh–gil´e-ad: and yet so they sufficed them not. 
JDG.21.15	And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the 
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin? 
JDG.21.17	And they said, 
JDG.21.18	Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed 
JDG.21.19	Then they said, Behold, 
JDG.21.20	Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; 
JDG.21.21	and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favorable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, 
JDG.21.23	And the children of Benjamin did so, and took 
JDG.21.24	And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
RUT.1.1	Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth–lehem–judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. 
RUT.1.2	And the name of the man 
RUT.1.3	And Elim´elech Na-o´mi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one 
RUT.1.5	And Mahlon and Chil´i-on died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
RUT.1.6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the 
RUT.1.7	Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. 
RUT.1.8	And Na-o´mi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the 
RUT.1.9	The 
RUT.1.10	And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people. 
RUT.1.11	And Na-o´mi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? 
RUT.1.12	Turn again, my daughters, go 
RUT.1.13	would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the 
RUT.1.14	And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her.
RUT.1.15	And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law. 
RUT.1.16	And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, 
RUT.1.17	where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the 
RUT.1.18	When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.
RUT.1.19	So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, 
RUT.1.20	And she said unto them, Call me not Na-o´mi,
RUT.1.21	I went out full, and the 
RUT.1.22	So Na-o´mi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	And Na-o´mi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elim´elech; and his name 
RUT.2.2	 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Na-o´mi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after 
RUT.2.3	And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field 
RUT.2.4	And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The 
RUT.2.5	Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel 
RUT.2.6	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It 
RUT.2.7	and she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
RUT.2.8	Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens: 
RUT.2.9	 thine eyes 
RUT.2.10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I 
RUT.2.11	And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband; and 
RUT.2.12	The 
RUT.2.13	Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.
RUT.2.14	And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched 
RUT.2.15	And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not: 
RUT.2.16	and let fall also 
RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley. 
RUT.2.18	And she took 
RUT.2.19	And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned today? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought today 
RUT.2.20	And Na-o´mi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed 
RUT.2.21	And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. 
RUT.2.22	And Na-o´mi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, 
RUT.2.23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	Then Na-o´mi her mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? 
RUT.3.2	And now 
RUT.3.3	Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: 
RUT.3.4	And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. 
RUT.3.5	And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.
RUT.3.6	And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her. 
RUT.3.7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. 
RUT.3.8	And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. 
RUT.3.9	And he said, Who 
RUT.3.10	And he said, Blessed 
RUT.3.11	And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou 
RUT.3.12	And now it is true that I 
RUT.3.13	Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, 
RUT.3.14	And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor. 
RUT.3.15	Also he said, Bring the veil that 
RUT.3.16	And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who 
RUT.3.17	And she said, These six 
RUT.3.18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.
RUT.4.1	Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. 
RUT.4.2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down. 
RUT.4.3	And he said unto the kinsman, Na-o´mi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which 
RUT.4.4	and I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy 
RUT.4.5	Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Na-o´mi, thou must buy 
RUT.4.6	And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem 
RUT.4.8	Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy 
RUT.4.9	And Boaz said unto the elders, and 
RUT.4.10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye 
RUT.4.11	 And all the people that 
RUT.4.12	 and let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the 
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the 
RUT.4.14	And the women said unto Na-o´mi, Blessed 
RUT.4.15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of 
RUT.4.16	And Na-o´mi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. 
RUT.4.17	And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Na-o´mi; and they called his name Obed: he 
RUT.4.18	Now these 
RUT.4.19	and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Ammin´adab, 
RUT.4.20	and Ammin´adab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 
RUT.4.21	and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, 
RUT.4.22	and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
1SA.1.1	Now there was a certain man of Ramatha´im–zo´phim, of mount E´phra-im, and his name 
1SA.1.2	and he had two wives; the name of the one 
1SA.1.3	And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.1.4	And when the time was that Elka´nah offered, he gave to Penin´nah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 
1SA.1.5	but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the 
1SA.1.6	And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the 
1SA.1.7	And 
1SA.1.8	Then said Elka´nah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? 
1SA.1.9	So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the 
1SA.1.10	And she 
1SA.1.11	 And she vowed a vow, and said, O 
1SA.1.12	And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the 
1SA.1.13	Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. 
1SA.1.14	And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. 
1SA.1.15	And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I 
1SA.1.16	Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Be´li-al: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. 
1SA.1.17	Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant 
1SA.1.18	And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more 
1SA.1.19	And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the 
1SA.1.20	Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, 
1SA.1.21	And the man Elka´nah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the 
1SA.1.22	But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, 
1SA.1.23	And Elka´nah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the 
1SA.1.24	And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the 
1SA.1.25	And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. 
1SA.1.26	And she said, O my lord, 
1SA.1.27	For this child I prayed; and the 
1SA.1.28	therefore also I have lent him to the 
1SA.2.1	My heart rejoiceth in the 
1SA.2.1	mine horn is exalted in the 
1SA.2.1	my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;
1SA.2.1	because I rejoice in thy salvation.
1SA.2.2	for 
1SA.2.2	neither 
1SA.2.3	Talk no more so exceeding proudly;
1SA.2.3	let 
1SA.2.3	for the 
1SA.2.3	and by him actions are weighed.
1SA.2.4	The bows of the mighty men 
1SA.2.4	and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
1SA.2.5	and 
1SA.2.5	so that the barren hath borne seven;
1SA.2.5	and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
1SA.2.6	The 
1SA.2.6	he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
1SA.2.7	The 
1SA.2.7	he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
1SA.2.8	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
1SA.2.8	to set 
1SA.2.8	and to make them inherit the throne of glory:
1SA.2.8	for the pillars of the earth 
1SA.2.8	and he hath set the world upon them.
1SA.2.9	He will keep the feet of his saints,
1SA.2.9	and the wicked shall be silent in darkness;
1SA.2.9	for by strength shall no man prevail.
1SA.2.10	The adversaries of the 
1SA.2.10	out of heaven shall he thunder upon them:
1SA.2.10	the 
1SA.2.10	and he shall give strength unto his king,
1SA.2.10	and exalt the horn of his anointed.
1SA.2.11	And Elka´nah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the 
1SA.2.12	Now the sons of Eli 
1SA.2.13	And the priest's custom with the people 
1SA.2.14	and he struck 
1SA.2.15	Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. 
1SA.2.16	And 
1SA.2.17	Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the 
1SA.2.18	But Samuel ministered before the 
1SA.2.19	Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought 
1SA.2.20	And Eli blessed Elka´nah and his wife, and said, The 
1SA.2.21	And the 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled 
1SA.2.23	And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. 
1SA.2.24	Nay, my sons; for 
1SA.2.25	If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the 
1SA.2.26	And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the 
1SA.2.27	And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
1SA.2.28	 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel 
1SA.2.29	Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded 
1SA.2.30	Wherefore the 
1SA.2.31	Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house. 
1SA.2.32	And thou shalt see an enemy 
1SA.2.33	And the man of thine, 
1SA.2.34	And this 
1SA.2.35	And I will raise me up a faithful priest, 
1SA.2.36	And it shall come to pass, 
1SA.3.1	And the child Samuel ministered unto the 
1SA.3.2	And it came to pass at that time, when Eli 
1SA.3.3	and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the 
1SA.3.4	that the 
1SA.3.5	And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here 
1SA.3.6	And the 
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know the 
1SA.3.8	And the 
1SA.3.9	Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, 
1SA.3.10	And the 
1SA.3.11	And the 
1SA.3.12	In that day I will perform against Eli all 
1SA.3.13	For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. 
1SA.3.14	And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
1SA.3.15	And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the 
1SA.3.16	Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here 
1SA.3.17	And he said, What 
1SA.3.18	And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It 
1SA.3.19	And Samuel grew, and the 
1SA.3.20	And all Israel from Dan even to Beer–sheba knew that Samuel 
1SA.3.21	And the 
1SA.4.1	And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.
1SA.4.1	Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebene´zer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek. 
1SA.4.2	And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. 
1SA.4.3	And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the 
1SA.4.4	 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.5	And when the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.6	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What 
1SA.4.7	And the Philistines were afraid; for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. 
1SA.4.8	Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these 
1SA.4.9	Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
1SA.4.10	And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. 
1SA.4.11	And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phin´ehas, were slain.
1SA.4.12	And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. 
1SA.4.13	And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told 
1SA.4.14	And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What 
1SA.4.15	Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see. 
1SA.4.16	And the man said unto Eli, I 
1SA.4.17	And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phin´ehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. 
1SA.4.18	And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
1SA.4.19	And his daughter-in-law, Phin´ehas' wife, was with child, 
1SA.4.20	And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard 
1SA.4.21	And she named the child Ich´abod,
1SA.4.22	And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.
1SA.5.1	And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebene´zer unto Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon 
1SA.5.4	And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon 
1SA.5.5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.
1SA.5.6	But the hand of the 
1SA.5.7	And when the men of Ashdod saw that 
1SA.5.8	They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about 
1SA.5.9	And it was 
1SA.5.10	Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ek´ronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. 
1SA.5.11	So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. 
1SA.5.12	And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	And the ark of the 
1SA.6.2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the 
1SA.6.3	And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. 
1SA.6.4	Then said they, What 
1SA.6.5	Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. 
1SA.6.6	Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed? 
1SA.6.7	Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them: 
1SA.6.8	and take the ark of the 
1SA.6.9	And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth–she´mesh, 
1SA.6.10	And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home: 
1SA.6.11	and they laid the ark of the 
1SA.6.12	And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth–she´mesh, 
1SA.6.13	And 
1SA.6.14	And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth–she´mite, and stood there, where 
1SA.6.15	And the Levites took down the ark of the 
1SA.6.16	And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen 
1SA.6.17	And these 
1SA.6.18	and the golden mice, 
1SA.6.19	And he smote the men of Beth–she´mesh, because they had looked into the ark of the 
1SA.6.20	And the men of Beth–she´mesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy 
1SA.6.21	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kir´jath–je´arim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the 
1SA.7.2	And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kir´jath–je´arim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the 
1SA.7.3	And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the 
1SA.7.4	Then the children of Israel did put away Ba´alim and Ash´toreth, and served the 
1SA.7.5	And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the 
1SA.7.6	And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured 
1SA.7.7	And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard 
1SA.7.8	And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the 
1SA.7.9	And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered 
1SA.7.10	And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the 
1SA.7.11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until 
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone, and set 
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the 
1SA.7.14	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
1SA.7.16	And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth–el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places. 
1SA.7.17	And his return 
1SA.8.1	And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abi´ah: 
1SA.8.3	And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, 
1SA.8.5	 and said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. 
1SA.8.6	But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the 
1SA.8.7	And the 
1SA.8.8	According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. 
1SA.8.9	Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
1SA.8.10	And Samuel told all the words of the 
1SA.8.11	And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint 
1SA.8.12	And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and 
1SA.8.13	And he will take your daughters 
1SA.8.14	And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, 
1SA.8.15	And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. 
1SA.8.16	And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put 
1SA.8.17	He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. 
1SA.8.18	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the 
1SA.8.19	Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 
1SA.8.20	that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. 
1SA.8.21	And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the 
1SA.8.22	And the 
1SA.9.1	Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name 
1SA.9.2	And he had a son, whose name 
1SA.9.3	And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. 
1SA.9.4	And he passed through mount E´phra-im, and passed through the land of Shali´sha, but they found 
1SA.9.6	And he said unto him, Behold now, 
1SA.9.7	Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, 
1SA.9.8	And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: 
1SA.9.9	(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for 
1SA.9.10	Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God 
1SA.9.12	And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, 
1SA.9.13	as soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; 
1SA.9.14	And they went up into the city: 
1SA.9.15	Now the 
1SA.9.16	Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him 
1SA.9.17	And when Samuel saw Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house 
1SA.9.19	And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I 
1SA.9.20	And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom 
1SA.9.21	And Saul answered and said, 
1SA.9.22	And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which 
1SA.9.23	And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee. 
1SA.9.24	And the cook took up the shoulder, and 
1SA.9.24	So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. 
1SA.9.25	And when they were come down from the high place into the city, 
1SA.9.26	And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured 
1SA.10.2	When thou art departed from me today, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? 
1SA.10.3	Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth–el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine: 
1SA.10.4	and they will salute thee, and give thee two 
1SA.10.5	After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where 
1SA.10.6	and the Spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, 
1SA.10.8	And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, 
1SA.10.9	And it was 
1SA.10.10	And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied
1SA.10.11	And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What 
1SA.10.12	 And one of the same place answered and said, But who 
1SA.10.13	And when he had made an end of prophesying,
1SA.10.14	And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that 
1SA.10.15	And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you. 
1SA.10.16	And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
1SA.10.17	And Samuel called the people together unto the 
1SA.10.18	and said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the 
1SA.10.19	and ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, 
1SA.10.20	And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken. 
1SA.10.21	When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found. 
1SA.10.22	Therefore they inquired of the 
1SA.10.23	And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. 
1SA.10.24	And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the 
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote 
1SA.10.26	And Saul also went home to Gib´e-ah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched. 
1SA.10.27	But the children of Be´li-al said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.
1SA.11.1	Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Ja´besh–gil´e-ad: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee. 
1SA.11.2	And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this 
1SA.11.3	And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if 
1SA.11.4	Then came the messengers to Gib´e-ah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
1SA.11.5	And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field: and Saul said, What 
1SA.11.6	And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly. 
1SA.11.7	And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent 
1SA.11.8	And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 
1SA.11.9	And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Ja´besh–gil´e-ad, Tomorrow, by 
1SA.11.10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you. 
1SA.11.11	And it was 
1SA.11.12	And the people said unto Samuel, Who 
1SA.11.13	And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for today the 
1SA.11.14	Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there. 
1SA.11.15	And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the 
1SA.12.1	And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons 
1SA.12.3	Behold, here I 
1SA.12.4	And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man's hand. 
1SA.12.5	And he said unto them, The 
1SA.12.7	Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the 
1SA.12.8	 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the 
1SA.12.9	 And when they forgat the 
1SA.12.10	 And they cried unto the 
1SA.12.11	 And the 
1SA.12.12	 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the 
1SA.12.13	Now therefore, behold the king whom ye have chosen, 
1SA.12.14	If ye will fear the 
1SA.12.15	but if ye will not obey the voice of the 
1SA.12.16	Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the 
1SA.12.17	 not wheat harvest today? I will call unto the 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called unto the 
1SA.12.19	And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the 
1SA.12.20	And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the 
1SA.12.21	and turn ye not aside: for 
1SA.12.22	For the 
1SA.12.23	Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the 
1SA.12.24	only fear the 
1SA.12.25	But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
1SA.13.1	Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, 
1SA.13.2	Saul chose him three thousand 
1SA.13.3	And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that 
1SA.13.4	And all Israel heard say 
1SA.13.5	And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which 
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. 
1SA.13.7	And 
1SA.13.9	And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. 
1SA.13.11	And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and 
1SA.13.12	therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the 
1SA.13.13	And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the 
1SA.13.14	 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the 
1SA.13.15	And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gib´e-ah of Benjamin.
1SA.13.15	And Saul numbered the people 
1SA.13.16	And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people 
1SA.13.17	And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way 
1SA.13.18	and another company turned the way 
1SA.13.19	Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make 
1SA.13.20	but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. 
1SA.13.21	Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. 
1SA.13.22	So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that 
1SA.13.23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
1SA.14.1	Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that 
1SA.14.2	And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gib´e-ah under a pomegranate tree which 
1SA.14.3	and Ahi´ah, the son of Ahi´tub, Ich´abod's brother, the son of Phin´ehas, the son of Eli, the 
1SA.14.4	And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, 
1SA.14.5	The forefront of the one 
1SA.14.6	And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the 
1SA.14.7	And his armor-bearer said unto him, Do all that 
1SA.14.8	Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto 
1SA.14.9	If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the 
1SA.14.11	And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. 
1SA.14.12	And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armor-bearer, Come up after me: for the 
1SA.14.13	And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor-bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor-bearer slew after him. 
1SA.14.14	And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were a half acre of land, 
1SA.14.15	And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
1SA.14.16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gib´e-ah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down 
1SA.14.17	Then said Saul unto the people that 
1SA.14.18	And Saul said unto Ahi´ah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel. 
1SA.14.19	And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that 
1SA.14.20	And Saul and all the people that 
1SA.14.21	Moreover, the Hebrews 
1SA.14.22	Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount E´phra-im, 
1SA.14.23	So the 
1SA.14.24	And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed 
1SA.14.25	And all 
1SA.14.26	And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath. 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that 
1SA.14.28	Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed 
1SA.14.29	Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
1SA.14.30	How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
1SA.14.31	And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ai´jalon: and the people were very faint. 
1SA.14.32	And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew 
1SA.14.33	 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the 
1SA.14.34	And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay 
1SA.14.35	And Saul built an altar unto the 
1SA.14.36	And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest. Let us draw near hither unto God. 
1SA.14.37	And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. 
1SA.14.38	And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. 
1SA.14.39	For, 
1SA.14.40	Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee. 
1SA.14.41	Therefore Saul said unto the 
1SA.14.42	And Saul said, Cast 
1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that 
1SA.14.44	And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan. 
1SA.14.45	And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
1SA.14.47	So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed 
1SA.14.48	And he gathered a host, and smote the Amal´ekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
1SA.14.49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ish´u-i, and Melchi–shu´a: and the names of his two daughters 
1SA.14.50	and the name of Saul's wife 
1SA.14.51	And Kish 
1SA.14.52	And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
1SA.15.2	 Thus saith the 
1SA.15.3	Now go and smite Am´alek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
1SA.15.4	And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Tela´im, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. 
1SA.15.5	And Saul came to a city of Am´alek, and laid wait in the valley. 
1SA.15.6	And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amal´ekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amal´ekites. 
1SA.15.7	And Saul smote the Amal´ekites from Hav´ilah 
1SA.15.8	And he took Agag the king of the Amal´ekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all 
1SA.15.10	Then came the word of the 
1SA.15.11	It repenteth me that I have set up Saul 
1SA.15.12	And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. 
1SA.15.13	And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed 
1SA.15.14	And Samuel said, What 
1SA.15.15	And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amal´ekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the 
1SA.15.17	And Samuel said, When thou 
1SA.15.18	And the 
1SA.15.19	Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the 
1SA.15.20	And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the 
1SA.15.21	But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.15.22	And Samuel said, Hath the 
1SA.15.23	For rebellion 
1SA.15.24	And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the 
1SA.15.25	Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the 
1SA.15.26	And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.27	And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent. 
1SA.15.28	And Samuel said unto him, The 
1SA.15.29	And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he 
1SA.15.30	Then he said, I have sinned: 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the 
1SA.15.32	Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amal´ekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. 
1SA.15.33	And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gib´e-ah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the 
1SA.16.1	And the 
1SA.16.2	And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear 
1SA.16.3	And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me 
1SA.16.4	And Samuel did that which the 
1SA.16.5	And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.16.6	And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eli´ab, and said, Surely the 
1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abin´adab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the 
1SA.16.9	Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the 
1SA.16.10	Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The 
1SA.16.11	And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all 
1SA.16.12	And he sent, and brought him in. Now he 
1SA.16.13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.14	But the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. 
1SA.16.16	Let our lord now command thy servants, 
1SA.16.17	And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring 
1SA.16.18	Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth´lehemite, 
1SA.16.19	Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which 
1SA.16.20	And Jesse took an ass 
1SA.16.21	And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor-bearer. 
1SA.16.22	And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight. 
1SA.16.23	And it came to pass, when the 
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which 
1SA.17.2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and 
1SA.17.4	And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goli´ath, of Gath, whose height 
1SA.17.5	And 
1SA.17.6	And 
1SA.17.7	And the staff of his spear 
1SA.17.8	And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set 
1SA.17.9	If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us. 
1SA.17.10	And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. 
1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
1SA.17.12	Now David 
1SA.17.13	And the three eldest sons of Jesse went 
1SA.17.14	And David 
1SA.17.15	But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem. 
1SA.17.16	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
1SA.17.17	And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched 
1SA.17.18	and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of 
1SA.17.19	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, 
1SA.17.20	And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle. 
1SA.17.21	For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army. 
1SA.17.22	And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren. 
1SA.17.23	And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goli´ath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard 
1SA.17.24	And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. 
1SA.17.25	And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, 
1SA.17.26	And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who 
1SA.17.27	And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
1SA.17.28	And Eli´ab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eli´ab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. 
1SA.17.29	And David said, What have I now done? 
1SA.17.30	And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
1SA.17.31	And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed 
1SA.17.32	And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. 
1SA.17.33	And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou 
1SA.17.34	And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: 
1SA.17.35	and I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered 
1SA.17.36	Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. 
1SA.17.37	David said moreover, The 
1SA.17.38	And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. 
1SA.17.39	And David girded his sword upon his armor, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved 
1SA.17.40	And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling 
1SA.17.41	And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield 
1SA.17.42	And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was 
1SA.17.43	And the Philistine said unto David, 
1SA.17.44	And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. 
1SA.17.45	Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	This day will the 
1SA.17.47	And all this assembly shall know that the 
1SA.17.48	And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. 
1SA.17.49	And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang 
1SA.17.50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but 
1SA.17.51	Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. 
1SA.17.52	And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Sha-ara´im, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. 
1SA.17.53	And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. 
1SA.17.54	And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
1SA.17.55	And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son 
1SA.17.56	And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling 
1SA.17.57	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
1SA.17.58	And Saul said to him, Whose son 
1SA.18.1	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 
1SA.18.2	And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. 
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 
1SA.18.4	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that 
1SA.18.5	And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, 
1SA.18.6	And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music. 
1SA.18.7	 And the women answered 
1SA.18.7	Saul hath slain his thousands,
1SA.18.7	and David his ten thousands.
1SA.18.8	And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed 
1SA.18.9	And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1SA.18.10	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied
1SA.18.11	And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall 
1SA.18.12	And Saul was afraid of David, because the 
1SA.18.13	Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 
1SA.18.14	And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the 
1SA.18.15	Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him. 
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
1SA.18.17	And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the 
1SA.18.18	And David said unto Saul, Who 
1SA.18.19	But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto A´dri-el the Meho´lathite to wife.
1SA.18.20	And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. 
1SA.18.21	And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law in 
1SA.18.22	And Saul commanded his servants, 
1SA.18.23	And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son-in-law, seeing that I 
1SA.18.24	And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David. 
1SA.18.25	And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
1SA.18.26	And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law: and the days were not expired. 
1SA.18.27	Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 
1SA.18.28	And Saul saw and knew that the 
1SA.18.29	And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
1SA.18.30	Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, 
1SA.19.1	And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. 
1SA.19.2	But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself: 
1SA.19.3	and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou 
1SA.19.4	And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works 
1SA.19.5	for he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the 
1SA.19.6	And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, 
1SA.19.7	And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
1SA.19.8	And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him. 
1SA.19.9	And the evil spirit from the 
1SA.19.10	And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
1SA.19.12	So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	And Michal took an image, and laid 
1SA.19.14	And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He 
1SA.19.15	And Saul sent the messengers 
1SA.19.16	And when the messengers were come in, behold, 
1SA.19.17	And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
1SA.19.18	So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Nai´oth. 
1SA.19.19	And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David 
1SA.19.20	And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing 
1SA.19.21	And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied
1SA.19.22	Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that 
1SA.19.23	And he went thither to Nai´oth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Nai´oth in Ramah. 
1SA.19.24	 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied
1SA.20.1	And David fled from Nai´oth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what 
1SA.20.2	And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it 
1SA.20.3	And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly, 
1SA.20.4	Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do 
1SA.20.5	 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow 
1SA.20.6	If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked 
1SA.20.7	If he say thus, 
1SA.20.8	Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the 
1SA.20.9	And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee? 
1SA.20.10	Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what 
1SA.20.11	And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
1SA.20.12	And Jonathan said unto David, O 
1SA.20.13	the 
1SA.20.14	And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the 
1SA.20.15	 but 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made 
1SA.20.17	And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow 
1SA.20.19	And 
1SA.20.20	And I will shoot three arrows on the side 
1SA.20.21	And, behold, I will send a lad, 
1SA.20.22	But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows 
1SA.20.23	And 
1SA.20.24	So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat. 
1SA.20.25	And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, 
1SA.20.26	Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he 
1SA.20.27	And it came to pass on the morrow, 
1SA.20.28	And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked 
1SA.20.29	and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me 
1SA.20.30	Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious 
1SA.20.31	For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die. 
1SA.20.32	And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done? 
1SA.20.33	And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David. 
1SA.20.34	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
1SA.20.35	And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. 
1SA.20.36	And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. 
1SA.20.37	And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, 
1SA.20.38	And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. 
1SA.20.39	But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter. 
1SA.20.40	And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry 
1SA.20.41	 as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of 
1SA.20.42	And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the 
1SA.21.2	And David said unto Ahim´elech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed 
1SA.21.3	Now therefore what is under thine hand? give 
1SA.21.4	And the priest answered David, and said, 
1SA.21.5	And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women 
1SA.21.6	 So the priest gave him hallowed 
1SA.21.7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul 
1SA.21.8	And David said unto Ahim´elech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste. 
1SA.21.9	 And the priest said, The sword of Goli´ath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it 
1SA.21.10	And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	 And the servants of Achish said unto him, 
1SA.21.11	Saul hath slain his thousands,
1SA.21.11	and David his ten thousands?
1SA.21.13	 And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. 
1SA.21.14	Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore 
1SA.21.15	Have I need of madmen, that ye have brought this 
1SA.22.2	And every one 
1SA.22.3	And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, 
1SA.22.4	And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold. 
1SA.22.5	And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
1SA.22.6	When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that 
1SA.22.7	then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, 
1SA.22.8	that all of you have conspired against me, and 
1SA.22.9	 Then answered Do´eg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahim´elech the son of Ahi´tub. 
1SA.22.10	And he inquired of the 
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent to call Ahim´elech the priest, the son of Ahi´tub, and all his father's house, the priests that 
1SA.22.12	And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahi´tub. And he answered, Here I 
1SA.22.13	And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? 
1SA.22.14	Then Ahim´elech answered the king, and said, And who 
1SA.22.15	Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute 
1SA.22.16	And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahim´elech, thou, and all thy father's house. 
1SA.22.17	And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the 
1SA.22.18	And the king said to Do´eg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Do´eg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. 
1SA.22.19	And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
1SA.22.20	And one of the sons of Ahim´elech the son of Ahi´tub, named Abi´athar, escaped, and fled after David. 
1SA.22.21	And Abi´athar showed David that Saul had slain the 
1SA.22.22	And David said unto Abi´athar, I knew 
1SA.22.23	Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou 
1SA.23.1	Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Kei´lah, and they rob the threshingfloors. 
1SA.23.2	Therefore David inquired of the 
1SA.23.3	And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Kei´lah against the armies of the Philistines? 
1SA.23.4	Then David inquired of the 
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Kei´lah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Kei´lah.
1SA.23.6	And it came to pass, when Abi´athar the son of Ahim´elech fled to David to Kei´lah, 
1SA.23.7	And it was told Saul that David was come to Kei´lah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars. 
1SA.23.8	And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Kei´lah, to besiege David and his men. 
1SA.23.9	And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abi´athar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. 
1SA.23.10	Then said David, O 
1SA.23.11	Will the men of Kei´lah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O 
1SA.23.12	Then said David, Will the men of Kei´lah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the 
1SA.23.13	Then David and his men, 
1SA.23.14	And David abode in the wilderness in strongholds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
1SA.23.15	And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David 
1SA.23.16	And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God. 
1SA.23.17	And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth. 
1SA.23.18	 And they two made a covenant before the 
1SA.23.20	Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part 
1SA.23.21	And Saul said, Blessed 
1SA.23.22	Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, 
1SA.23.23	See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
1SA.23.24	And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men 
1SA.23.25	Saul also and his men went to seek 
1SA.23.26	And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. 
1SA.23.27	But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. 
1SA.23.28	Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Se´la–hammah´lekoth.
1SA.23.29	And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strongholds at En–ge´di.
1SA.24.1	And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David 
1SA.24.2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. 
1SA.24.3	 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where 
1SA.24.4	And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the 
1SA.24.5	And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. 
1SA.24.6	And he said unto his men, The 
1SA.24.7	So David stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on 
1SA.24.8	David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself. 
1SA.24.9	And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? 
1SA.24.10	Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the 
1SA.24.11	Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that 
1SA.24.12	The 
1SA.24.13	As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. 
1SA.24.14	After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. 
1SA.24.15	The 
1SA.24.16	And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, 
1SA.24.17	And he said to David, Thou 
1SA.24.18	And thou hast showed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the 
1SA.24.19	For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the 
1SA.24.20	And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. 
1SA.24.21	Swear now therefore unto me by the 
1SA.24.22	And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.
1SA.25.1	And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.
1SA.25.1	And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. 
1SA.25.2	And 
1SA.25.3	Now the name of the man 
1SA.25.4	And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep. 
1SA.25.5	And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name: 
1SA.25.6	and thus shall ye say to him that liveth 
1SA.25.7	And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel. 
1SA.25.8	Ask thy young men, and they will show thee. Wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
1SA.25.9	And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased. 
1SA.25.10	And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who 
1SA.25.11	Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give 
1SA.25.12	So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings. 
1SA.25.13	And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.
1SA.25.14	But one of the young men told Ab´igail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them. 
1SA.25.15	But the men 
1SA.25.16	They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 
1SA.25.17	Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he 
1SA.25.18	Then Ab´igail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched 
1SA.25.19	And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal. 
1SA.25.20	And it was 
1SA.25.21	Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this 
1SA.25.22	So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that 
1SA.25.23	And when Ab´igail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, 
1SA.25.24	and fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, 
1SA.25.25	Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Be´li-al, 
1SA.25.26	Now therefore, my lord, 
1SA.25.27	And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord. 
1SA.25.28	I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the 
1SA.25.29	Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the 
1SA.25.30	And it shall come to pass, when the 
1SA.25.31	that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offense of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the 
1SA.25.32	And David said to Ab´igail, Blessed 
1SA.25.33	and blessed 
1SA.25.34	For in very deed, 
1SA.25.35	So David received of her hand 
1SA.25.36	And Ab´igail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart 
1SA.25.37	But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became 
1SA.25.38	And it came to pass about ten days 
1SA.25.39	And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed 
1SA.25.40	And when the servants of David were come to Ab´igail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife. 
1SA.25.41	And she arose, and bowed herself on 
1SA.25.42	And Ab´igail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
1SA.25.43	David also took Ahin´o-am of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives. 
1SA.25.44	But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of La´ish, which 
1SA.26.2	Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. 
1SA.26.3	And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachi´lah, which 
1SA.26.4	David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed. 
1SA.26.5	And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.
1SA.26.6	Then answered David and said to Ahim´elech the Hittite, and to Ab´ishai the son of Zeru-i´ah, brother to Jo´ab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Ab´ishai said, I will go down with thee. 
1SA.26.7	So David and Ab´ishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him. 
1SA.26.8	Then said Ab´ishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not 
1SA.26.9	And David said to Ab´ishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the 
1SA.26.10	David said furthermore, 
1SA.26.11	The 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw 
1SA.26.13	Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off; a great space 
1SA.26.14	and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who 
1SA.26.15	And David said to Abner, 
1SA.26.16	This thing 
1SA.26.17	And Saul knew David's voice, and said, 
1SA.26.18	And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil 
1SA.26.19	Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the 
1SA.26.20	Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the 
1SA.26.21	Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly. 
1SA.26.22	And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it. 
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, Blessed 
1SA.27.1	And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: 
1SA.27.2	And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that 
1SA.27.3	And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, 
1SA.27.4	And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
1SA.27.5	And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee? 
1SA.27.6	Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day. 
1SA.27.7	And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
1SA.27.8	And David and his men went up, and invaded the Gesh´urites, and the Gezrites, and the Amal´ekites: for those 
1SA.27.9	And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish. 
1SA.27.10	And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road today? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerah´meelites, and against the south of the Kenites. 
1SA.27.11	And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring 
1SA.27.12	And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
1SA.28.1	And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men. 
1SA.28.2	And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.
1SA.28.4	And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilbo´a. 
1SA.28.5	And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled. 
1SA.28.6	 And when Saul inquired of the 
1SA.28.7	Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, 
1SA.28.8	And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me 
1SA.28.9	And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die? 
1SA.28.10	And Saul sware to her by the 
1SA.28.11	Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel. 
1SA.28.12	And when the woman saw Samuel,
1SA.28.13	And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods
1SA.28.14	And he said unto her, What form 
1SA.28.15	And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. 
1SA.28.16	Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the 
1SA.28.17	 And the 
1SA.28.18	 because thou obeyedst not the voice of the 
1SA.28.19	Moreover the 
1SA.28.20	Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. 
1SA.28.21	And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me. 
1SA.28.22	Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way. 
1SA.28.23	But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 
1SA.28.24	And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded 
1SA.28.25	and she brought 
1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which 
1SA.29.2	And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish. 
1SA.29.3	Then said the princes of the Philistines, What 
1SA.29.4	And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? 
1SA.29.5	Saul slew his thousands,
1SA.29.5	and David his ten thousands?
1SA.29.6	Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, 
1SA.29.7	Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines. 
1SA.29.8	And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king? 
1SA.29.9	And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou 
1SA.29.10	Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart. 
1SA.29.11	So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amal´ekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 
1SA.30.2	and had taken the women captives, that 
1SA.30.3	So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, 
1SA.30.4	Then David and the people that 
1SA.30.5	 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahin´o-am the Jez´reelitess, and Ab´igail the wife of Nabal the Car´melite. 
1SA.30.6	And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the 
1SA.30.8	And David inquired at the 
1SA.30.9	So David went, he and the six hundred men that 
1SA.30.10	But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
1SA.30.11	And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water; 
1SA.30.12	and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk 
1SA.30.13	And David said unto him, To whom 
1SA.30.14	We made an invasion 
1SA.30.15	And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.
1SA.30.16	And when he had brought him down, behold, 
1SA.30.17	And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled. 
1SA.30.18	And David recovered all that the Amal´ekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any 
1SA.30.20	And David took all the flocks and the herds, 
1SA.30.21	And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that 
1SA.30.22	Then answered all the wicked men, and 
1SA.30.23	Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the 
1SA.30.24	For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part 
1SA.30.25	And it was 
1SA.30.26	And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, 
1SA.30.27	to 
1SA.30.28	and to 
1SA.30.29	and to 
1SA.30.30	and to 
1SA.30.31	and to 
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilbo´a. 
1SA.31.2	And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abin´adab, and Melchi–shu´a, Saul's sons. 
1SA.31.3	And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. 
1SA.31.4	Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. 
1SA.31.5	And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men, that same day together. 
1SA.31.7	And when the men of Israel that 
1SA.31.8	And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilbo´a. 
1SA.31.9	And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish 
1SA.31.10	And they put his armor in the house of Ash´toreth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth–shan. 
1SA.31.11	And when the inhabitants of Ja´besh–gil´e-ad heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth–shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. 
1SA.31.13	And they took their bones, and buried 
2SA.1.1	Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amal´ekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; 
2SA.1.2	it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and 
2SA.1.3	And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. 
2SA.1.4	And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. 
2SA.1.5	And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? 
2SA.1.6	 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilbo´a, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. 
2SA.1.7	And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here 
2SA.1.8	And he said unto me, Who 
2SA.1.9	He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life 
2SA.1.10	So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that 
2SA.1.11	Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that 
2SA.1.12	and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the 
2SA.1.13	And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence 
2SA.1.14	And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the 
2SA.1.15	And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, 
2SA.1.16	And David said unto him, Thy blood 
2SA.1.17	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: 
2SA.1.18	 (also he bade them teach the children of Judah 
2SA.1.19	The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places:
2SA.1.19	how are the mighty fallen!
2SA.1.20	Tell 
2SA.1.20	publish 
2SA.1.20	lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
2SA.1.20	lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
2SA.1.21	Ye mountains of Gilbo´a,
2SA.1.21	nor fields of offerings:
2SA.1.21	for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away,
2SA.1.21	the shield of Saul, 
2SA.1.22	From the blood of the slain,
2SA.1.22	from the fat of the mighty,
2SA.1.22	the bow of Jonathan turned not back,
2SA.1.22	and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan 
2SA.1.23	and in their death they were not divided:
2SA.1.23	they were swifter than eagles,
2SA.1.23	they were stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	Ye daughters of Israel,
2SA.1.24	weep over Saul,
2SA.1.24	who clothed you in scarlet, with 
2SA.1.24	who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
2SA.1.25	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
2SA.1.25	O Jonathan, 
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:
2SA.1.26	very pleasant hast thou been unto me:
2SA.1.26	thy love to me was wonderful,
2SA.1.26	passing the love of women.
2SA.1.27	How are the mighty fallen,
2SA.1.27	and the weapons of war perished!
2SA.2.1	And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the 
2SA.2.2	 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahin´o-am the Jez´reelitess, and Ab´igail Nabal's wife the Car´melite. 
2SA.2.3	And his men that 
2SA.2.4	 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.
2SA.2.4	And they told David, saying, 
2SA.2.5	And David sent messengers unto the men of Ja´besh–gil´e-ad, and said unto them, Blessed 
2SA.2.6	And now the 
2SA.2.7	Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
2SA.2.8	But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish–bo´sheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahana´im; 
2SA.2.9	and made him king over Gil´e-ad, and over the Ash´urites, and over Jezreel, and over E´phra-im, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. 
2SA.2.10	Ish–bo´sheth Saul's son 
2SA.2.11	And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2SA.2.12	And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish–bo´sheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahana´im to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	And Jo´ab the son of Zeru-i´ah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. 
2SA.2.14	And Abner said to Jo´ab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Jo´ab said, Let them arise. 
2SA.2.15	Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which 
2SA.2.16	And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and 
2SA.2.17	And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
2SA.2.18	And there were three sons of Zeru-i´ah there, Jo´ab, and Ab´ishai, and As´ahel: and As´ahel 
2SA.2.19	And As´ahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. 
2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him, and said, 
2SA.2.21	And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armor. But As´ahel would not turn aside from following of him. 
2SA.2.22	And Abner said again to As´ahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Jo´ab thy brother? 
2SA.2.23	Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth 
2SA.2.24	Jo´ab also and Ab´ishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that 
2SA.2.25	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill. 
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called to Jo´ab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren? 
2SA.2.27	And Jo´ab said, 
2SA.2.28	So Jo´ab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
2SA.2.29	And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahana´im. 
2SA.2.30	And Jo´ab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and As´ahel. 
2SA.2.31	But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, 
2SA.2.32	And they took up As´ahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which 
2SA.3.1	Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
2SA.3.2	And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahin´o-am the Jez´reelitess; 
2SA.3.3	and his second, Chil´e-ab, of Ab´igail the wife of Nabal the Car´melite; and the third, Ab´salom the son of Ma´acah the daughter of Tal´mai king of Geshur; 
2SA.3.4	and the fourth, Adoni´jah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephati´ah the son of Abi´tal; 
2SA.3.5	and the sixth, Ith´re-am, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul. 
2SA.3.7	And Saul had a concubine, whose name 
2SA.3.8	Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish–bo´sheth, and said, 
2SA.3.9	So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the 
2SA.3.10	 to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer–sheba. 
2SA.3.11	And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
2SA.3.12	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose 
2SA.3.13	And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face. 
2SA.3.14	 And David sent messengers to Ish–bo´sheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver 
2SA.3.15	And Ish–bo´sheth sent, and took her from 
2SA.3.16	And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahu´rim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.
2SA.3.17	And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past 
2SA.3.18	now then do 
2SA.3.19	And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
2SA.3.20	So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that 
2SA.3.21	And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
2SA.3.22	And, behold, the servants of David and Jo´ab came from 
2SA.3.23	When Jo´ab and all the host that 
2SA.3.24	Then Jo´ab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why 
2SA.3.25	Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
2SA.3.26	And when Jo´ab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew 
2SA.3.27	And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Jo´ab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth 
2SA.3.28	And afterward when David heard 
2SA.3.29	Let it rest on the head of Jo´ab; and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Jo´ab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread. 
2SA.3.30	So Jo´ab and Ab´ishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother As´ahel at Gibeon in the battle.
2SA.3.31	And David said to Jo´ab, and to all the people that 
2SA.3.32	And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. 
2SA.3.33	And the king lamented over Abner, and said,
2SA.3.33	Died Abner
2SA.3.34	Thy hands 
2SA.3.34	nor thy feet put into fetters:
2SA.3.34	as a man falleth before wicked men,
2SA.3.34	And all the people wept again over him. 
2SA.3.35	And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down. 
2SA.3.36	And all the people took notice 
2SA.3.37	For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. 
2SA.3.38	And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? 
2SA.3.39	And I 
2SA.4.1	And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. 
2SA.4.2	And Saul's son had two men 
2SA.4.3	and the Beer´othites fled to Gitta´im, and were sojourners there until this day.)
2SA.4.5	And the sons of Rimmon the Beer´othite, Rechab and Ba´anah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish–bo´sheth, who lay on a bed at noon. 
2SA.4.6	And they came thither into the midst of the house, 
2SA.4.7	For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night. 
2SA.4.8	And they brought the head of Ish–bo´sheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish–bo´sheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the 
2SA.4.9	And David answered Rechab and Ba´anah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beer´othite, and said unto them, 
2SA.4.10	 when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who 
2SA.4.11	how much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? 
2SA.4.12	And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged 
2SA.5.1	Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we 
2SA.5.2	Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the 
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the 
2SA.5.4	 David 
2SA.5.5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion: the same 
2SA.5.8	And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jeb´usites, and the lame and the blind, 
2SA.5.9	So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. 
2SA.5.10	And David went on, and grew great, and the 
2SA.5.11	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David a house. 
2SA.5.12	And David perceived that the 
2SA.5.13	And David took 
2SA.5.14	And these 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar also, and Elishu´a, and Nepheg, and Japhi´a, 
2SA.5.16	and Elish´ama, and Eli´ada, and Eliph´alet.
2SA.5.17	But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard 
2SA.5.18	The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Reph´a-im. 
2SA.5.19	And David inquired of the 
2SA.5.20	And David came to Ba´al–per´azim, and David smote them there, and said, The 
2SA.5.21	And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.
2SA.5.22	And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Reph´a-im. 
2SA.5.23	And when David inquired of the 
2SA.5.24	And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the 
2SA.5.25	And David did so, as the 
2SA.6.1	Again, David gathered together all the chosen 
2SA.6.2	 And David arose, and went with all the people that 
2SA.6.3	 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abin´adab that 
2SA.6.4	And they brought it out of the house of Abin´adab which 
2SA.6.5	And David and all the house of Israel played before the 
2SA.6.6	And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth 
2SA.6.7	And the anger of the 
2SA.6.8	And David was displeased, because the 
2SA.6.9	And David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	So David would not remove the ark of the 
2SA.6.11	 And the ark of the 
2SA.6.12	And it was told king David, saying, The 
2SA.6.13	And it was 
2SA.6.14	And David danced before the 
2SA.6.15	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the 
2SA.6.16	And as the ark of the 
2SA.6.17	And they brought in the ark of the 
2SA.6.18	And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	 And he dealt among all the people, 
2SA.6.20	Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! 
2SA.6.21	And David said unto Michal, 
2SA.6.22	And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honor. 
2SA.6.23	Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
2SA.7.1	And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the 
2SA.7.2	that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. 
2SA.7.3	And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that 
2SA.7.4	And it came to pass that night, that the word of the 
2SA.7.5	Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the 
2SA.7.6	Whereas I have not dwelt in 
2SA.7.7	In all 
2SA.7.8	Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the 
2SA.7.9	and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great 
2SA.7.10	Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime, 
2SA.7.11	and as since the time that I commanded judges 
2SA.7.12	And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 
2SA.7.13	He shall build a house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 
2SA.7.14	 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: 
2SA.7.15	but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took 
2SA.7.16	And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. 
2SA.7.17	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
2SA.7.18	Then went king David in, and sat before the 
2SA.7.19	And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord 
2SA.7.20	And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord 
2SA.7.21	For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know 
2SA.7.22	Wherefore thou art great, O 
2SA.7.23	And what one nation in the earth 
2SA.7.24	For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel 
2SA.7.25	And now, O 
2SA.7.26	And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The 
2SA.7.27	For thou, O 
2SA.7.28	And now, O Lord 
2SA.7.29	therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord 
2SA.8.1	And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg–am´mah out of the hand of the Philistines.
2SA.8.2	And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And 
2SA.8.3	David smote also Hadade´zer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphra´tes. 
2SA.8.4	And David took from him a thousand 
2SA.8.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadade´zer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
2SA.8.6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, 
2SA.8.7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadade´zer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
2SA.8.8	And from Betah, and from Ber´othai, cities of Hadade´zer, king David took exceeding much brass.
2SA.8.9	When To´i king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadade´zer, 
2SA.8.10	then To´i sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadade´zer, and smitten him: for Hadade´zer had wars with To´i. And 
2SA.8.11	which also king David did dedicate unto the 
2SA.8.12	of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Am´alek, and of the spoil of Hadade´zer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
2SA.8.14	And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the 
2SA.8.15	And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people. 
2SA.8.16	And Jo´ab the son of Zeru-i´ah 
2SA.8.17	and Zadok the son of Ahi´tub, and Ahim´elech the son of Abi´athar, 
2SA.8.18	and Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada 
2SA.9.2	And 
2SA.9.3	 And the king said, 
2SA.9.4	And the king said unto him, Where 
2SA.9.5	Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Am´mi-el, from Lo–de´bar. 
2SA.9.6	Now when Mephib´osheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephib´osheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant! 
2SA.9.7	And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. 
2SA.9.8	And he bowed himself, and said, What 
2SA.9.9	Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house. 
2SA.9.10	Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in 
2SA.9.11	Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephib´osheth, 
2SA.9.12	And Mephib´osheth had a young son, whose name 
2SA.9.13	So Mephib´osheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.
2SA.10.1	And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. 
2SA.10.2	Then said David, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 
2SA.10.3	And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David 
2SA.10.4	Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, 
2SA.10.5	When they told 
2SA.10.6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth–re´hob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Ma´acah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men. 
2SA.10.7	And when David heard of 
2SA.10.8	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Ma´acah, 
2SA.10.9	When Jo´ab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice 
2SA.10.10	and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Ab´ishai his brother, that he might put 
2SA.10.11	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 
2SA.10.12	Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the 
2SA.10.13	And Jo´ab drew nigh, and the people that 
2SA.10.14	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Ab´ishai, and entered into the city. So Jo´ab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 
2SA.10.16	And Hadare´zer sent, and brought out the Syrians that 
2SA.10.17	And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. 
2SA.10.18	And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew 
2SA.10.19	And when all the kings 
2SA.11.2	And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman 
2SA.11.3	And David sent and inquired after the woman. And 
2SA.11.4	And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house. 
2SA.11.5	And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I 
2SA.11.6	And David sent to Jo´ab, 
2SA.11.7	And when Uri´ah was come unto him, David demanded 
2SA.11.8	And David said to Uri´ah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uri´ah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess 
2SA.11.9	But Uri´ah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. 
2SA.11.10	And when they had told David, saying, Uri´ah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uri´ah, Camest thou not from 
2SA.11.11	And Uri´ah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Jo´ab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? 
2SA.11.12	And David said to Uri´ah, Tarry here today also, and tomorrow I will let thee depart. So Uri´ah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow. 
2SA.11.13	And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
2SA.11.14	And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Jo´ab, and sent 
2SA.11.15	And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uri´ah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die. 
2SA.11.16	And it came to pass, when Jo´ab observed the city, that he assigned Uri´ah unto a place where he knew that valiant men 
2SA.11.17	And the men of the city went out, and fought with Jo´ab: and there fell 
2SA.11.18	Then Jo´ab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; 
2SA.11.19	and charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king, 
2SA.11.20	and if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	 Who smote Abim´elech the son of Jerub´besheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uri´ah the Hittite is dead also.
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Jo´ab had sent him for. 
2SA.11.23	And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate. 
2SA.11.24	And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and 
2SA.11.25	Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Jo´ab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
2SA.11.26	And when the wife of Uri´ah heard that Uri´ah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. 
2SA.11.27	And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the 
2SA.12.2	The rich 
2SA.12.3	but the poor 
2SA.12.4	And there came a traveler unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him. 
2SA.12.5	And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, 
2SA.12.6	and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
2SA.12.7	And Nathan said to David, Thou 
2SA.12.8	and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if 
2SA.12.9	Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the 
2SA.12.10	Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uri´ah the Hittite to be thy wife. 
2SA.12.11	 Thus saith the 
2SA.12.12	For thou didst 
2SA.12.13	And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.14	Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the 
2SA.12.15	And Nathan departed unto his house.
2SA.12.15	And the 
2SA.12.16	David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. 
2SA.12.17	And the elders of his house arose, 
2SA.12.18	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? 
2SA.12.19	But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. 
2SA.12.20	Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed 
2SA.12.21	Then said his servants unto him, What thing 
2SA.12.22	And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell 
2SA.12.23	But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
2SA.12.24	And David comforted Bath–she´ba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the 
2SA.12.25	And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidi´ah,
2SA.12.26	And Jo´ab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. 
2SA.12.27	And Jo´ab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. 
2SA.12.28	Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. 
2SA.12.29	And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. 
2SA.12.30	And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof 
2SA.12.31	And he brought forth the people that 
2SA.13.1	And it came to pass after this, that Ab´salom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name 
2SA.13.2	And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she 
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend, whose name 
2SA.13.4	And he said unto him, Why 
2SA.13.5	And Jon´adab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see 
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
2SA.13.7	Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat. 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded 
2SA.13.9	And she took a pan, and poured 
2SA.13.10	And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought 
2SA.13.11	And when she had brought 
2SA.13.12	And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly. 
2SA.13.13	And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. 
2SA.13.14	Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her 
2SA.13.16	And she said unto him, 
2SA.13.17	Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this 
2SA.13.18	And 
2SA.13.19	And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that 
2SA.13.20	And Ab´salom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he 
2SA.13.21	But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. 
2SA.13.22	And Ab´salom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Ab´salom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	And it came to pass after two full years, that Ab´salom had sheepshearers in Ba´al–ha´zor, which 
2SA.13.24	And Ab´salom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant. 
2SA.13.25	And the king said to Ab´salom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him. 
2SA.13.26	Then said Ab´salom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee? 
2SA.13.27	But Ab´salom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. 
2SA.13.28	Now Ab´salom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant. 
2SA.13.29	And the servants of Ab´salom did unto Amnon as Ab´salom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.
2SA.13.30	And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Ab´salom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left. 
2SA.13.31	Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. 
2SA.13.32	And Jon´adab, the son of Shim´e-ah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose 
2SA.13.33	Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.
2SA.13.34	But Ab´salom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hillside behind him. 
2SA.13.35	And Jon´adab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is. 
2SA.13.36	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
2SA.13.38	So Ab´salom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. 
2SA.13.39	And 
2SA.14.1	Now Jo´ab the son of Zeru-i´ah perceived that the king's heart 
2SA.14.2	And Jo´ab sent to Teko´a, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead: 
2SA.14.3	and come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Jo´ab put the words in her mouth.
2SA.14.4	And when the woman of Teko´a spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king. 
2SA.14.5	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I 
2SA.14.6	And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and 
2SA.14.7	And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband 
2SA.14.8	And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee. 
2SA.14.9	And the woman of Teko´a said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity 
2SA.14.10	And the king said, Whosoever saith 
2SA.14.11	Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the 
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak 
2SA.14.13	And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished. 
2SA.14.14	For we must needs die, and 
2SA.14.15	Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, 
2SA.14.16	For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man 
2SA.14.17	Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so 
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak. 
2SA.14.19	And the king said, 
2SA.14.20	to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Jo´ab done this thing: and my lord 
2SA.14.21	And the king said unto Jo´ab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Ab´salom again. 
2SA.14.22	And Jo´ab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Jo´ab said, Today thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant. 
2SA.14.23	So Jo´ab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Ab´salom to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Ab´salom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
2SA.14.25	But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab´salom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 
2SA.14.26	And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled 
2SA.14.27	And unto Ab´salom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name 
2SA.14.28	So Ab´salom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face. 
2SA.14.29	Therefore Ab´salom sent for Jo´ab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come. 
2SA.14.30	Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Jo´ab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Ab´salom's servants set the field on fire. 
2SA.14.31	Then Jo´ab arose, and came to Ab´salom unto 
2SA.14.32	And Ab´salom answered Jo´ab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? 
2SA.14.33	So Jo´ab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Ab´salom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Ab´salom.
2SA.15.1	And it came to pass after this, that Ab´salom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 
2SA.15.2	And Ab´salom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was 
2SA.15.3	And Ab´salom said unto him, See, thy matters 
2SA.15.4	Ab´salom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! 
2SA.15.5	And it was 
2SA.15.6	And on this manner did Ab´salom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Ab´salom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2SA.15.7	And it came to pass after forty years, that Ab´salom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the 
2SA.15.8	For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the 
2SA.15.9	And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	But Ab´salom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Ab´salom reigneth in Hebron. 
2SA.15.11	And with Ab´salom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, 
2SA.15.12	And Ab´salom sent for Ahith´ophel the Gi´lonite, David's counselor, from his city, 
2SA.15.13	And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Ab´salom. 
2SA.15.14	And David said unto all his servants that 
2SA.15.15	And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants 
2SA.15.16	And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, 
2SA.15.17	And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off. 
2SA.15.18	And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cher´ethites, and all the Pel´ethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
2SA.15.19	Then said the king to It´tai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou 
2SA.15.20	Whereas thou camest 
2SA.15.21	And It´tai answered the king, and said, 
2SA.15.22	And David said to It´tai, Go and pass over. And It´tai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that 
2SA.15.23	And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites 
2SA.15.25	And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the 
2SA.15.26	but if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, 
2SA.15.27	The king said also unto Zadok the priest, 
2SA.15.28	 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. 
2SA.15.29	Zadok therefore and Abi´athar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
2SA.15.30	And David went up by the ascent of 
2SA.15.31	And 
2SA.15.32	And it came to pass, that 
2SA.15.33	unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: 
2SA.15.34	but if thou return to the city, and say unto Ab´salom, I will be thy servant, O king; 
2SA.15.35	And 
2SA.15.36	Behold, 
2SA.15.37	So Hu´shai David's friend came into the city, and Ab´salom came into Jerusalem.
2SA.16.2	And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses 
2SA.16.3	And the king said, And where 
2SA.16.4	Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine 
2SA.16.5	And when king David came to Bahu´rim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name 
2SA.16.6	And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men 
2SA.16.7	And thus said Shim´e-i when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Be´li-al. 
2SA.16.8	The 
2SA.16.9	Then said Ab´ishai the son of Zeru-i´ah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. 
2SA.16.10	And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeru-i´ah? so let him curse, because the 
2SA.16.11	And David said to Ab´ishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now 
2SA.16.12	It may be that the 
2SA.16.13	And as David and his men went by the way, Shim´e-i went along on the hillside over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. 
2SA.16.14	And the king, and all the people that 
2SA.16.15	And Ab´salom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahith´ophel with him. 
2SA.16.16	And it came to pass, when Hu´shai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Ab´salom, that Hu´shai said unto Ab´salom, God save the king, God save the king. 
2SA.16.17	And Ab´salom said to Hu´shai, 
2SA.16.18	And Hu´shai said unto Ab´salom, Nay; but whom the 
2SA.16.19	And again, whom should I serve? 
2SA.16.20	Then said Ab´salom to Ahith´ophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do. 
2SA.16.21	And Ahith´ophel said unto Ab´salom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that 
2SA.16.22	 So they spread Ab´salom a tent upon the top of the house; and Ab´salom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. 
2SA.16.23	And the counsel of Ahith´ophel, which he counseled in those days, 
2SA.17.1	Moreover Ahith´ophel said unto Ab´salom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night: 
2SA.17.2	and I will come upon him while he 
2SA.17.3	and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest 
2SA.17.4	And the saying pleased Ab´salom well, and all the elders of Israel.
2SA.17.5	Then said Ab´salom, Call now Hu´shai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith. 
2SA.17.6	And when Hu´shai was come to Ab´salom, Ab´salom spake unto him, saying, Ahith´ophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do 
2SA.17.7	And Hu´shai said unto Ab´salom, The counsel that Ahith´ophel hath given 
2SA.17.8	For, said Hu´shai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they 
2SA.17.9	Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some 
2SA.17.10	And he also 
2SA.17.11	Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer–sheba, as the sand that 
2SA.17.12	So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that 
2SA.17.13	Moreover if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there. 
2SA.17.14	And Ab´salom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hu´shai the Archite 
2SA.17.15	Then said Hu´shai unto Zadok and to Abi´athar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahith´ophel counsel Ab´salom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled. 
2SA.17.16	Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that 
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahim´a-az stayed by En–ro´gel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David. 
2SA.17.18	Nevertheless, a lad saw them, and told Ab´salom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahu´rim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down. 
2SA.17.19	And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known. 
2SA.17.20	And when Ab´salom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where 
2SA.17.21	And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahith´ophel counseled against you. 
2SA.17.22	Then David arose, and all the people that 
2SA.17.23	And when Ahith´ophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled 
2SA.17.24	Then David came to Mahana´im. And Ab´salom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 
2SA.17.25	And Ab´salom made Ama´sa captain of the host instead of Jo´ab: which Ama´sa 
2SA.17.26	So Israel and Ab´salom pitched in the land of Gil´e-ad.
2SA.17.27	And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahana´im, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Am´mi-el of Lo–de´bar, and Barzil´lai the Gil´e-adite of Ro´gelim, 
2SA.17.28	brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched 
2SA.17.29	and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that 
2SA.18.1	And David numbered the people that 
2SA.18.2	And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Jo´ab, and a third part under the hand of Ab´ishai the son of Zeru-i´ah, Jo´ab's brother, and a third part under the hand of It´tai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also. 
2SA.18.3	But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now 
2SA.18.4	And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. 
2SA.18.5	And the king commanded Jo´ab and Ab´ishai and It´tai, saying, 
2SA.18.6	So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of E´phra-im; 
2SA.18.7	where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand 
2SA.18.8	For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2SA.18.9	And Ab´salom met the servants of David. And Ab´salom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that 
2SA.18.10	And a certain man saw 
2SA.18.11	And Jo´ab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest 
2SA.18.12	And the man said unto Jo´ab, Though I should receive a thousand 
2SA.18.13	Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against 
2SA.18.14	Then said Jo´ab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Ab´salom, while he 
2SA.18.15	And ten young men that bare Jo´ab's armor compassed about and smote Ab´salom, and slew him.
2SA.18.16	And Jo´ab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Jo´ab held back the people. 
2SA.18.17	And they took Ab´salom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. 
2SA.18.18	Now Ab´salom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which 
2SA.18.19	Then said Ahim´a-az the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the 
2SA.18.20	And Jo´ab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. 
2SA.18.21	Then said Jo´ab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Jo´ab, and ran. 
2SA.18.22	Then said Ahim´a-az the son of Zadok yet again to Jo´ab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Jo´ab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? 
2SA.18.23	But howsoever, 
2SA.18.24	And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. 
2SA.18.25	And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he 
2SA.18.26	And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold 
2SA.18.27	And the watchman said, Methinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahim´a-az the son of Zadok. And the king said, He 
2SA.18.28	And Ahim´a-az called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed 
2SA.18.29	And the king said, Is the young man Ab´salom safe? And Ahim´a-az answered, When Jo´ab sent the king's servant, and 
2SA.18.30	And the king said 
2SA.18.31	And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the 
2SA.18.32	And the king said unto Cushi, 
2SA.18.33	And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Ab´salom! my son, my son Ab´salom! would God I had died for thee, O Ab´salom, my son, my son!
2SA.19.1	And it was told Jo´ab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Ab´salom. 
2SA.19.2	And the victory that day was 
2SA.19.3	And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 
2SA.19.4	But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Ab´salom! O Ab´salom, my son, my son! 
2SA.19.5	And Jo´ab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 
2SA.19.6	in that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Ab´salom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well. 
2SA.19.7	Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
2SA.19.9	And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Ab´salom. 
2SA.19.10	And Ab´salom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
2SA.19.11	And king David sent to Zadok and to Abi´athar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, 
2SA.19.12	Ye 
2SA.19.13	And say ye to Ama´sa, 
2SA.19.14	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as 
2SA.19.15	So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
2SA.19.17	And 
2SA.19.18	And there went over a ferryboat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shim´e-i the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; 
2SA.19.19	and said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. 
2SA.19.20	For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king. 
2SA.19.21	But Ab´ishai the son of Zeru-i´ah answered and said, Shall not Shim´e-i be put to death for this, because he cursed the 
2SA.19.22	And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeru-i´ah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I 
2SA.19.23	Therefore the king said unto Shim´e-i, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.
2SA.19.25	And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephib´osheth? 
2SA.19.26	And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant 
2SA.19.27	And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king 
2SA.19.28	For all 
2SA.19.29	And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land. 
2SA.19.30	And Mephib´osheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.
2SA.19.32	Now Barzil´lai was a very aged man, 
2SA.19.33	And the king said unto Barzil´lai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem. 
2SA.19.34	And Barzil´lai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	I 
2SA.19.36	Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 
2SA.19.37	Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, 
2SA.19.38	And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, 
2SA.19.39	And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzil´lai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place. 
2SA.19.40	Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
2SA.19.41	And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan? 
2SA.19.42	And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king 
2SA.19.43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more 
2SA.20.2	So every man of Israel went up from after David, 
2SA.20.4	Then said the king to Ama´sa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present. 
2SA.20.5	So Ama´sa went to assemble 
2SA.20.6	And David said to Ab´ishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than 
2SA.20.7	And there went out after him Jo´ab's men, and the Cher´ethites, and the Pel´ethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.8	When they 
2SA.20.9	And Jo´ab said to Ama´sa, 
2SA.20.10	But Ama´sa took no heed of the sword that 
2SA.20.10	So Jo´ab and Ab´ishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.11	And one of Jo´ab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoreth Jo´ab, and he that 
2SA.20.12	And Ama´sa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Ama´sa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still. 
2SA.20.13	When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Jo´ab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.14	And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth–ma´achah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him. 
2SA.20.15	And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth–ma´achah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that 
2SA.20.16	Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Jo´ab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee. 
2SA.20.17	And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, 
2SA.20.18	Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask 
2SA.20.19	I 
2SA.20.20	And Jo´ab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. 
2SA.20.21	The matter 
2SA.20.22	Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom: and they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast 
2SA.20.23	Now Jo´ab 
2SA.20.24	and Ado´ram 
2SA.20.25	and Sheva 
2SA.20.26	and Ira also the Ja´irite was a chief ruler about David.
2SA.21.1	Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the 
2SA.21.2	 And the king called the Gib´e-onites, and said unto them; (now the Gib´e-onites 
2SA.21.3	wherefore David said unto the Gib´e-onites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the 
2SA.21.4	And the Gib´e-onites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, 
2SA.21.5	And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us 
2SA.21.6	let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the 
2SA.21.8	 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Ai´ah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armo´ni and Mephib´osheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for A´dri-el the son of Barzil´lai the Meho´lathite: 
2SA.21.9	and he delivered them into the hands of the Gib´e-onites, and they hanged them in the hill before the 
2SA.21.10	And Rizpah the daughter of Ai´ah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. 
2SA.21.11	And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Ai´ah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 
2SA.21.12	 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Ja´besh–gil´e-ad, which had stolen them from the street of Beth–shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilbo´a: 
2SA.21.13	and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. 
2SA.21.14	And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
2SA.21.15	Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint. 
2SA.21.16	And Ish´bi–be´nob, which 
2SA.21.17	But Ab´ishai the son of Zeru-i´ah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.
2SA.21.18	And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sib´bechai the Hu´shathite slew Saph, which 
2SA.21.19	And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elha´nan the son of Ja´are–o´regim, a Beth´lehemite, slew 
2SA.21.20	And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of 
2SA.21.21	And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shim´e-ah the brother of David slew him. 
2SA.21.22	These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
2SA.22.1	And David spake unto the 
2SA.22.2	and he said,
2SA.22.2	The 
2SA.22.3	the God of my rock; in him will I trust:
2SA.22.3	my saviour; thou savest me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I will call on the 
2SA.22.4	so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
2SA.22.5	When the waves of death compassed me,
2SA.22.5	the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
2SA.22.6	the sorrows of hell
2SA.22.6	the snares of death prevented me.
2SA.22.7	In my distress I called upon the 
2SA.22.7	and cried to my God:
2SA.22.7	and he did hear my voice out of his temple,
2SA.22.7	and my cry 
2SA.22.8	Then the earth shook and trembled;
2SA.22.8	the foundations of heaven moved
2SA.22.8	and shook, because he was wroth.
2SA.22.9	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,
2SA.22.9	and fire out of his mouth devoured:
2SA.22.9	coals were kindled by it.
2SA.22.10	He bowed the heavens also, and came down;
2SA.22.10	and darkness 
2SA.22.11	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly:
2SA.22.11	and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
2SA.22.12	And he made darkness pavilions round about him,
2SA.22.12	dark waters, 
2SA.22.13	Through the brightness before him
2SA.22.13	were coals of fire kindled.
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.14	and the Most High uttered his voice.
2SA.22.15	And he sent out arrows, and scattered them;
2SA.22.15	lightning, and discomfited them.
2SA.22.16	And the channels of the sea appeared,
2SA.22.16	the foundations of the world were discovered,
2SA.22.16	at the rebuking of the 
2SA.22.16	at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
2SA.22.17	He sent from above, he took me;
2SA.22.17	he drew me out of many waters:
2SA.22.18	he delivered me from my strong enemy,
2SA.22.18	for they were too strong for me.
2SA.22.19	They prevented me in the day of my calamity:
2SA.22.19	but the 
2SA.22.20	He brought me forth also into a large place:
2SA.22.20	he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
2SA.22.21	The 
2SA.22.21	according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the 
2SA.22.22	and have not wickedly departed from my God.
2SA.22.23	For all his judgments 
2SA.22.23	and 
2SA.22.24	I was also upright before him,
2SA.22.24	and have kept myself from mine iniquity.
2SA.22.25	Therefore the 
2SA.22.25	according to my cleanness in his eyesight.
2SA.22.26	With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful,
2SA.22.27	With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure;
2SA.22.27	and with the froward thou wilt show thyself unsavory.
2SA.22.28	And the afflicted people thou wilt save:
2SA.22.28	but thine eyes 
2SA.22.29	For thou 
2SA.22.29	and the 
2SA.22.30	For by thee I have run through a troop:
2SA.22.30	by my God have I leaped over a wall.
2SA.22.31	the word of the 
2SA.22.31	he 
2SA.22.32	For who 
2SA.22.32	and who 
2SA.22.33	God 
2SA.22.33	and he maketh my way perfect.
2SA.22.34	and setteth me upon my high places.
2SA.22.35	He teacheth my hands to war;
2SA.22.35	so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
2SA.22.36	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation:
2SA.22.36	and thy gentleness hath made me great.
2SA.22.37	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me;
2SA.22.37	so that my feet did not slip.
2SA.22.38	I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them;
2SA.22.38	and turned not again until I had consumed them.
2SA.22.39	And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise:
2SA.22.39	yea, they are fallen under my feet.
2SA.22.40	For thou hast girded me with strength to battle:
2SA.22.40	them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
2SA.22.41	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies,
2SA.22.41	that I might destroy them that hate me.
2SA.22.42	They looked, but 
2SA.22.43	Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth:
2SA.22.43	I did stamp them as the mire of the street, 
2SA.22.44	Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
2SA.22.44	thou hast kept me 
2SA.22.44	a people 
2SA.22.45	Strangers shall submit themselves unto me:
2SA.22.45	as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
2SA.22.46	Strangers shall fade away,
2SA.22.46	and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
2SA.22.47	The 
2SA.22.47	and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
2SA.22.48	It 
2SA.22.48	and that bringeth down the people under me,
2SA.22.49	and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies:
2SA.22.49	thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me:
2SA.22.49	thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
2SA.22.50	and I will sing praises unto thy name.
2SA.22.51	and showeth mercy to his anointed,
2SA.22.51	unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
2SA.23.1	Now these 
2SA.23.1	David the son of Jesse said,
2SA.23.1	and the man 
2SA.23.1	the anointed of the God of Jacob,
2SA.23.1	and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
2SA.23.2	The Spirit of the 
2SA.23.2	and his word 
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel said,
2SA.23.3	the Rock of Israel spake to me,
2SA.23.3	He that ruleth over men

2SA.23.4	And 
2SA.23.4	by clear shining after rain.
2SA.23.5	Although my house 
2SA.23.5	yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant,
2SA.23.5	ordered in all 
2SA.23.5	for

2SA.23.6	because they cannot be taken with hands:
2SA.23.7	but the man 
2SA.23.7	must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear;
2SA.23.7	and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the 
2SA.23.8	These 
2SA.23.9	And after him 
2SA.23.10	he arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the 
2SA.23.11	And after him 
2SA.23.12	But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the 
2SA.23.13	And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adul´lam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Reph´a-im. 
2SA.23.14	And David 
2SA.23.15	And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which 
2SA.23.16	And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that 
2SA.23.17	And he said, Be it far from me, O 
2SA.23.18	And Ab´ishai, the brother of Jo´ab, the son of Zeru-i´ah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, 
2SA.23.19	Was he not most honorable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the 
2SA.23.20	And Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada, the son of a valiant man, of Kab´zeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow. 
2SA.23.21	And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
2SA.23.22	These 
2SA.23.23	He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the 
2SA.23.24	As´ahel the brother of Jo´ab

2SA.23.39	Uri´ah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
2SA.24.1	And again the anger of the 
2SA.24.2	For the king said to Jo´ab the captain of the host, which 
2SA.24.3	And Jo´ab said unto the king, Now the 
2SA.24.4	Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Jo´ab, and against the captains of the host. And Jo´ab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. 
2SA.24.5	And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aro´er, on the right side of the city that 
2SA.24.6	then they came to Gil´e-ad, and to the land of Tahtim–hod´shi; and they came to Dan–ja´an, and about to Zidon, 
2SA.24.7	and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, 
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
2SA.24.9	And Jo´ab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah 
2SA.24.10	And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the 
2SA.24.11	For when David was up in the morning, the word of the 
2SA.24.12	Go and say unto David, Thus saith the 
2SA.24.13	So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me. 
2SA.24.14	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the 
2SA.24.15	So the 
2SA.24.16	And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the 
2SA.24.17	And David spake unto the 
2SA.24.18	And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the 
2SA.24.19	And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the 
2SA.24.20	And Arau´nah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Arau´nah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground. 
2SA.24.21	And Arau´nah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the 
2SA.24.22	And Arau´nah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what 
2SA.24.23	All these 
2SA.24.24	And the king said unto Arau´nah, Nay; but I will surely buy 
2SA.24.25	And David built there an altar unto the 
1KI.1.1	Now king David was old 
1KI.1.2	Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. 
1KI.1.3	So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Ab´ishag a Shu´nammite, and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	And the damsel 
1KI.1.6	And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also 
1KI.1.7	And he conferred with Jo´ab the son of Zeru-i´ah, and with Abi´athar the priest: and they following Adoni´jah helped 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, and Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shim´e-i, and Re´i, and the mighty men which 
1KI.1.9	And Adoni´jah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zo´heleth, which 
1KI.1.10	but Nathan the prophet, and Benai´ah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
1KI.1.12	Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 
1KI.1.13	Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adoni´jah reign? 
1KI.1.14	Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
1KI.1.15	And Bath–she´ba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Ab´ishag the Shu´nammite ministered unto the king. 
1KI.1.16	And Bath–she´ba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 
1KI.1.17	And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the 
1KI.1.18	And now, behold, Adoni´jah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest 
1KI.1.19	and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abi´athar the priest, and Jo´ab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. 
1KI.1.20	And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel 
1KI.1.21	Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
1KI.1.22	And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. 
1KI.1.23	And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
1KI.1.24	And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adoni´jah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 
1KI.1.25	For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abi´athar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adoni´jah. 
1KI.1.26	But me, 
1KI.1.27	Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed 
1KI.1.28	Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath–she´ba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. 
1KI.1.29	And the king sware, and said, 
1KI.1.30	even as I sware unto thee by the 
1KI.1.31	Then Bath–she´ba bowed with 
1KI.1.32	And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada. And they came before the king. 
1KI.1.33	The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon: 
1KI.1.34	and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. 
1KI.1.35	Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. 
1KI.1.36	And Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada answered the king, and said, Amen: the 
1KI.1.37	As the 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada, and the Cher´ethites, and the Pel´ethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. 
1KI.1.39	And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon. 
1KI.1.40	And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
1KI.1.41	And Adoni´jah and all the guests that 
1KI.1.42	And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abi´athar the priest came: and Adoni´jah said unto him, Come in; for thou 
1KI.1.43	And Jonathan answered and said to Adoni´jah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. 
1KI.1.44	And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada, and the Cher´ethites, and the Pel´ethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule: 
1KI.1.45	and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This 
1KI.1.46	And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 
1KI.1.47	And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed. 
1KI.1.48	And also thus said the king, Blessed 
1KI.1.49	And all the guests that 
1KI.1.50	And Adoni´jah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
1KI.1.51	And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adoni´jah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword. 
1KI.1.52	And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die. 
1KI.1.53	So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.
1KI.2.1	Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying, 
1KI.2.2	I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man; 
1KI.2.3	and keep the charge of the 
1KI.2.4	that the 
1KI.2.6	Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. 
1KI.2.7	 But show kindness unto the sons of Barzil´lai the Gil´e-adite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Ab´salom thy brother. 
1KI.2.8	 And, behold, 
1KI.2.9	Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou 
1KI.2.10	So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 
1KI.2.11	 And the days that David reigned over Israel 
1KI.2.12	 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
1KI.2.13	And Adoni´jah the son of Haggith came to Bath–she´ba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. 
1KI.2.14	He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on. 
1KI.2.15	And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and 
1KI.2.16	And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on. 
1KI.2.17	And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Ab´ishag the Shu´nammite to wife. 
1KI.2.18	And Bath–she´ba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
1KI.2.19	Bath–she´ba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adoni´jah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 
1KI.2.20	Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; 
1KI.2.21	And she said, Let Ab´ishag the Shu´nammite be given to Adoni´jah thy brother to wife. 
1KI.2.22	And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Ab´ishag the Shu´nammite for Adoni´jah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he 
1KI.2.23	Then king Solomon sware by the 
1KI.2.24	Now therefore, 
1KI.2.25	And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada; and he fell upon him that he died.
1KI.2.27	 So Solomon thrust out Abi´athar from being priest unto the 
1KI.2.28	Then tidings came to Jo´ab: for Jo´ab had turned after Adoni´jah, though he turned not after Ab´salom. And Jo´ab fled unto the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.29	And it was told king Solomon that Jo´ab was fled unto the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.30	And Benai´ah came to the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.31	And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Jo´ab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. 
1KI.2.32	And the 
1KI.2.33	Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Jo´ab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the 
1KI.2.34	So Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 
1KI.2.35	And the king put Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abi´athar.
1KI.2.36	And the king sent and called for Shim´e-i, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. 
1KI.2.37	For it shall be, 
1KI.2.38	And Shim´e-i said unto the king, The saying 
1KI.2.39	And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shim´e-i ran away unto Achish son of Ma´achah king of Gath. And they told Shim´e-i, saying, Behold, thy servants 
1KI.2.40	And Shim´e-i arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shim´e-i went, and brought his servants from Gath. 
1KI.2.41	And it was told Solomon that Shim´e-i had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again. 
1KI.2.42	And the king sent and called for Shim´e-i, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the 
1KI.2.43	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the 
1KI.2.44	The king said moreover to Shim´e-i, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father; therefore the 
1KI.2.45	and king Solomon 
1KI.2.46	So the king commanded Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died.
1KI.2.46	And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
1KI.3.1	And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the 
1KI.3.2	Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the 
1KI.3.3	And Solomon loved the 
1KI.3.4	And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that 
1KI.3.5	In Gibeon the 
1KI.3.6	And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as 
1KI.3.7	And now, O 
1KI.3.8	And thy servant 
1KI.3.9	Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
1KI.3.10	And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. 
1KI.3.11	And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment; 
1KI.3.12	behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 
1KI.3.13	And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honor: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. 
1KI.3.14	And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
1KI.3.15	And Solomon awoke; and, behold, 
1KI.3.16	Then came there two women, 
1KI.3.17	And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. 
1KI.3.18	And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we 
1KI.3.19	And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it. 
1KI.3.20	And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 
1KI.3.21	And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear. 
1KI.3.22	And the other woman said, Nay; but the living 
1KI.3.23	Then said the king, The one saith, This 
1KI.3.24	And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. 
1KI.3.25	And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. 
1KI.3.26	Then spake the woman whose the living child 
1KI.3.27	Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she 
1KI.3.28	And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God 
1KI.4.1	So king Solomon was king over all Israel. 
1KI.4.2	And these 
1KI.4.3	Eliho´reph and Ahi´ah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehosh´aphat the son of Ahi´lud, the recorder. 
1KI.4.4	And Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada 
1KI.4.5	and Azari´ah the son of Nathan 
1KI.4.6	and Ahi´shar 
1KI.4.7	And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. 
1KI.4.8	And these 
1KI.4.9	the son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Sha-al´bim, and Beth–she´mesh, and E´lon–beth–ha´nan: 
1KI.4.10	the son of Hesed, in Aru´both; to him 
1KI.4.11	the son of Abin´adab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 
1KI.4.12	Ba´ana the son of Ahi´lud; 
1KI.4.13	the son of Geber, in Ra´moth–gil´e-ad; to him 
1KI.4.14	Ahin´adab the son of Iddo 
1KI.4.15	Ahim´a-az 
1KI.4.16	Ba´anah the son of Hu´shai 
1KI.4.17	Jehosh´aphat the son of Paru´ah, in Is´sachar: 
1KI.4.18	Shim´e-i the son of Elah, in Benjamin: 
1KI.4.19	Geber the son of Uri 
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel 
1KI.4.21	 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
1KI.4.22	And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, 
1KI.4.23	ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl. 
1KI.4.24	For he had dominion over all 
1KI.4.25	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer–sheba, all the days of Solomon. 
1KI.4.26	 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
1KI.4.27	And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 
1KI.4.28	Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where 
1KI.4.29	And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that 
1KI.4.30	And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
1KI.4.31	 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ez´rahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. 
1KI.4.32	 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. 
1KI.4.33	And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that 
1KI.4.34	And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
1KI.5.1	And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. 
1KI.5.2	And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 
1KI.5.3	Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house unto the name of the 
1KI.5.4	But now the 
1KI.5.5	 And, behold, I purpose to build a house unto the name of the 
1KI.5.6	Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that 
1KI.5.7	And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed 
1KI.5.8	And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: 
1KI.5.9	My servants shall bring 
1KI.5.10	So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees 
1KI.5.11	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat 
1KI.5.12	And the 
1KI.5.13	And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 
1KI.5.14	And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, 
1KI.5.15	And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 
1KI.5.16	besides the chief of Solomon's officers which 
1KI.5.17	And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, 
1KI.5.18	And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew 
1KI.6.1	And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which 
1KI.6.2	And the house which king Solomon built for the 
1KI.6.3	And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits 
1KI.6.4	And for the house he made windows of narrow lights. 
1KI.6.5	And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, 
1KI.6.6	The nethermost chamber 
1KI.6.7	And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe 
1KI.6.8	The door for the middle chamber 
1KI.6.9	So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar. 
1KI.6.10	And 
1KI.6.11	And the word of the 
1KI.6.12	 this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father: 
1KI.6.13	and I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 
1KI.6.15	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: 
1KI.6.16	 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built 
1KI.6.17	And the house, that 
1KI.6.18	And the cedar of the house within 
1KI.6.19	And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.6.20	And the oracle in the forepart 
1KI.6.21	So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. 
1KI.6.22	 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that 
1KI.6.24	And five cubits 
1KI.6.25	And the other cherub 
1KI.6.26	The height of the one cherub 
1KI.6.27	And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the 
1KI.6.28	And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1KI.6.29	And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without. 
1KI.6.30	And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
1KI.6.31	And for the entering of the oracle he made doors 
1KI.6.32	The two doors also 
1KI.6.33	So also made he for the door of the temple posts 
1KI.6.34	And the two doors 
1KI.6.35	And he carved 
1KI.6.36	And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
1KI.6.37	In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the 
1KI.6.38	and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which 
1KI.7.1	But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
1KI.7.2	He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof 
1KI.7.3	And 
1KI.7.4	And 
1KI.7.5	And all the doors and posts 
1KI.7.6	And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof 
1KI.7.7	Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, 
1KI.7.9	All these 
1KI.7.10	And the foundation 
1KI.7.11	And above 
1KI.7.12	And the great court round about 
1KI.7.13	And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. 
1KI.7.14	He 
1KI.7.15	For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about. 
1KI.7.16	And he made two chapiters 
1KI.7.17	 nets of checkerwork, and wreaths of chainwork, for the chapiters which 
1KI.7.18	And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that 
1KI.7.19	And the chapiters that 
1KI.7.20	And the chapiters upon the two pillars 
1KI.7.21	And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin:
1KI.7.22	And upon the top of the pillars 
1KI.7.23	And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: 
1KI.7.24	And under the brim of it round about 
1KI.7.25	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea 
1KI.7.26	And it 
1KI.7.27	And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits 
1KI.7.28	And the work of the bases 
1KI.7.29	and on the borders that 
1KI.7.30	And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver 
1KI.7.31	And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above 
1KI.7.32	And under the borders 
1KI.7.33	And the work of the wheels 
1KI.7.34	And 
1KI.7.35	And in the top of the base 
1KI.7.36	For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about. 
1KI.7.37	After this 
1KI.7.39	And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, over against the south.
1KI.7.40	And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the 
1KI.7.41	the two pillars, and the 
1KI.7.42	and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, 
1KI.7.43	and the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 
1KI.7.44	and one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea.
1KI.7.45	And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the 
1KI.7.46	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. 
1KI.7.47	And Solomon left all the vessels 
1KI.7.49	 and the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right 
1KI.7.50	and the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers 
1KI.8.2	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Eth´anim, which 
1KI.8.3	And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 
1KI.8.4	And they brought up the ark of the 
1KI.8.5	And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, 
1KI.8.6	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.8.7	For the cherubim spread forth 
1KI.8.8	And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy 
1KI.8.10	 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy 
1KI.8.11	so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the 
1KI.8.12	Then spake Solomon, The 
1KI.8.13	I have surely built thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever. 
1KI.8.14	And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood; 
1KI.8.15	and he said, Blessed 
1KI.8.16	 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. 
1KI.8.17	 And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the 
1KI.8.18	And the 
1KI.8.19	 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name. 
1KI.8.20	And the 
1KI.8.21	I have set there a place for the ark, wherein 
1KI.8.22	And Solomon stood before the altar of the 
1KI.8.23	and he said, 
1KI.8.24	who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled 
1KI.8.25	 Therefore now, 
1KI.8.26	And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
1KI.8.28	Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O 
1KI.8.29	 that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, 
1KI.8.30	And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.
1KI.8.31	If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house: 
1KI.8.32	then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
1KI.8.33	When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house: 
1KI.8.34	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.
1KI.8.35	When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 
1KI.8.36	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
1KI.8.37	If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, 
1KI.8.38	what prayer and supplication soever be 
1KI.8.39	then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, 
1KI.8.40	that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
1KI.8.41	Moreover concerning a stranger, that 
1KI.8.42	(for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house: 
1KI.8.43	hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as 
1KI.8.44	If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the 
1KI.8.45	then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
1KI.8.46	If they sin against thee, (for 
1KI.8.47	 if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; 
1KI.8.48	and 
1KI.8.49	then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause, 
1KI.8.50	and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them: 
1KI.8.51	for they 
1KI.8.52	that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee. 
1KI.8.53	For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, 
1KI.8.54	And it was 
1KI.8.55	And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 
1KI.8.56	 Blessed 
1KI.8.57	The 
1KI.8.58	that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers. 
1KI.8.59	And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the 
1KI.8.60	that all the people of the earth may know that the 
1KI.8.61	Let your heart therefore be perfect with the 
1KI.8.62	And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the 
1KI.8.63	And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the 
1KI.8.64	The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that 
1KI.8.65	And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the 
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the 
1KI.9.1	And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the 
1KI.9.2	 that the 
1KI.9.3	And the 
1KI.9.4	And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, 
1KI.9.5	 then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. 
1KI.9.6	 if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments 
1KI.9.7	then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people: 
1KI.9.8	 and at this house, 
1KI.9.9	And they shall answer, Because they forsook the 
1KI.9.10	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the 
1KI.9.11	(
1KI.9.12	And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. 
1KI.9.13	And he said, What cities 
1KI.9.14	And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
1KI.9.15	And this 
1KI.9.16	 Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it 
1KI.9.17	And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth–ho´ron the nether. 
1KI.9.18	And Ba´alath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 
1KI.9.19	and all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 
1KI.9.20	 all the people 
1KI.9.21	their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day. 
1KI.9.22	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they 
1KI.9.23	These 
1KI.9.24	But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which 
1KI.9.26	And king Solomon made a navy of ships in E´zi-on–ge´ber, which 
1KI.9.27	And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 
1KI.9.28	And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought 
1KI.10.2	And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 
1KI.10.3	And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not 
1KI.10.4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, 
1KI.10.5	and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the 
1KI.10.6	And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. 
1KI.10.7	Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen 
1KI.10.8	Happy 
1KI.10.9	Blessed be the 
1KI.10.10	And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
1KI.10.11	And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. 
1KI.10.12	And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the 
1KI.10.13	And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides 
1KI.10.14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, 
1KI.10.15	besides 
1KI.10.16	And king Solomon made two hundred targets 
1KI.10.17	And 
1KI.10.18	Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. 
1KI.10.19	The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne 
1KI.10.20	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. 
1KI.10.21	And all king Solomon's drinking vessels 
1KI.10.22	For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
1KI.10.23	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. 
1KI.10.24	And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
1KI.10.25	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
1KI.10.27	 And the king made silver 
1KI.10.28	 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
1KI.10.29	And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred 
1KI.11.2	 of the nations 
1KI.11.3	And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 
1KI.11.4	For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, 
1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after Ash´toreth the goddess of the Zido´ni-ans, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.6	And Solomon did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.11.7	Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that 
1KI.11.8	And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
1KI.11.9	And the 
1KI.11.10	and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the 
1KI.11.11	Wherefore the 
1KI.11.12	Notwithstanding, in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: 
1KI.11.13	Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; 
1KI.11.14	And the 
1KI.11.15	For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Jo´ab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom; 
1KI.11.16	(for six months did Jo´ab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:) 
1KI.11.17	that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad 
1KI.11.18	And they arose out of Mid´i-an, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. 
1KI.11.19	And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tah´penes the queen. 
1KI.11.20	And the sister of Tah´penes bare him Genu´bath his son, whom Tah´penes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genu´bath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh. 
1KI.11.21	And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Jo´ab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. 
1KI.11.22	Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.
1KI.11.23	And God stirred him up 
1KI.11.24	and he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them 
1KI.11.25	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad 
1KI.11.26	And Jerobo´am the son of Nebat, an Eph´rathite of Zere´da, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name 
1KI.11.27	And this 
1KI.11.28	And the man Jerobo´am 
1KI.11.29	And it came to pass at that time when Jerobo´am went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahi´jah the Shi´lonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two 
1KI.11.30	and Ahi´jah caught the new garment that 
1KI.11.31	and he said to Jerobo´am, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the 
1KI.11.32	(but he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:) 
1KI.11.33	because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ash´toreth the goddess of the Zido´ni-ans, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do 
1KI.11.34	Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: 
1KI.11.35	but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, 
1KI.11.36	And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there. 
1KI.11.37	And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 
1KI.11.38	And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do 
1KI.11.39	And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever. 
1KI.11.40	Solomon sought therefore to kill Jerobo´am. And Jerobo´am arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
1KI.11.41	And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, 
1KI.11.42	And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel 
1KI.11.43	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehobo´am his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.12.1	And Rehobo´am went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	And it came to pass, when Jerobo´am the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard 
1KI.12.3	that they sent and called him. And Jerobo´am and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehobo´am, saying, 
1KI.12.4	Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. 
1KI.12.5	And he said unto them, Depart yet 
1KI.12.6	And king Rehobo´am consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? 
1KI.12.7	And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever. 
1KI.12.8	But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, 
1KI.12.9	and he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? 
1KI.12.10	And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou 
1KI.12.11	And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1KI.12.12	So Jerobo´am and all the people came to Rehobo´am the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day. 
1KI.12.13	And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him; 
1KI.12.14	and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father 
1KI.12.15	Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the 
1KI.12.17	But 
1KI.12.18	Then king Rehobo´am sent Ado´ram, who 
1KI.12.19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. 
1KI.12.20	And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jerobo´am was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
1KI.12.21	And when Rehobo´am was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehobo´am the son of Solomon. 
1KI.12.22	But the word of God came unto Shemai´ah the man of God, saying, 
1KI.12.23	Speak unto Rehobo´am, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 
1KI.12.24	Thus saith the 
1KI.12.25	Then Jerobo´am built Shechem in mount E´phra-im, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penu´el. 
1KI.12.26	And Jerobo´am said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David: 
1KI.12.27	if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the 
1KI.12.28	 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves 
1KI.12.29	And he set the one in Beth–el, and the other put he in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	And this thing became a sin: for the people went 
1KI.12.31	And he made a house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 
1KI.12.32	 And Jerobo´am ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that 
1KI.12.33	So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth–el the fifteenth day of the eighth month, 
1KI.13.1	And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the 
1KI.13.2	 And he cried against the altar in the word of the 
1KI.13.3	And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This 
1KI.13.4	And it came to pass, when king Jerobo´am heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Beth–el, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him. 
1KI.13.5	The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the 
1KI.13.6	And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the face of the 
1KI.13.7	And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward. 
1KI.13.8	And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place: 
1KI.13.9	for so was it charged me by the word of the 
1KI.13.10	So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth–el.
1KI.13.11	Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth–el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth–el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father. 
1KI.13.12	And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah. 
1KI.13.13	And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon, 
1KI.13.14	and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, 
1KI.13.15	Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. 
1KI.13.16	And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: 
1KI.13.17	for it was said to me by the word of the 
1KI.13.18	He said unto him, I 
1KI.13.19	So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
1KI.13.20	And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the 
1KI.13.21	and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the 
1KI.13.22	but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which 
1KI.13.23	And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, 
1KI.13.24	And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass. 
1KI.13.25	And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told 
1KI.13.26	And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard 
1KI.13.27	And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled 
1KI.13.28	And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass. 
1KI.13.29	And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, 
1KI.13.31	And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God 
1KI.13.32	for the saying which he cried by the word of the 
1KI.13.33	After this thing Jerobo´am returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became 
1KI.13.34	And this thing became sin unto the house of Jerobo´am, even to cut 
1KI.14.1	At that time Abi´jah the son of Jerobo´am fell sick. 
1KI.14.2	And Jerobo´am said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jerobo´am; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there 
1KI.14.3	And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.
1KI.14.4	And Jerobo´am's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahi´jah. But Ahi´jah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. 
1KI.14.5	And the 
1KI.14.6	And it was 
1KI.14.7	Go, tell Jerobo´am, Thus saith the 
1KI.14.8	and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and 
1KI.14.9	but hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 
1KI.14.10	 therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jerobo´am, and will cut off from Jerobo´am him that pisseth against the wall, 
1KI.14.11	Him that dieth of Jerobo´am in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the 
1KI.14.12	Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: 
1KI.14.13	And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jerobo´am shall come to the grave, because in him there is found 
1KI.14.14	Moreover the 
1KI.14.15	For the 
1KI.14.16	And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jerobo´am, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.
1KI.14.17	And Jerobo´am's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: 
1KI.14.18	and they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the 
1KI.14.19	And the rest of the acts of Jerobo´am, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they 
1KI.14.20	And the days which Jerobo´am reigned 
1KI.14.21	And Rehobo´am the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehobo´am 
1KI.14.22	And Judah did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.14.23	 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree. 
1KI.14.24	 And there were also sodomites in the land: 
1KI.14.26	 and he took away the treasures of the house of the 
1KI.14.27	And king Rehobo´am made in their stead brazen shields, and committed 
1KI.14.28	And it was 
1KI.14.29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehobo´am, and all that he did, 
1KI.14.30	And there was war between Rehobo´am and Jerobo´am all 
1KI.14.31	And Rehobo´am slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name 
1KI.15.1	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jerobo´am the son of Nebat reigned Abi´jam over Judah. 
1KI.15.2	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name 
1KI.15.3	And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the 
1KI.15.4	 Nevertheless for David's sake did the 
1KI.15.5	 because David did 
1KI.15.6	 And there was war between Rehobo´am and Jerobo´am all the days of his life. 
1KI.15.7	Now the rest of the acts of Abi´jam, and all that he did, 
1KI.15.8	And Abi´jam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.9	And in the twentieth year of Jerobo´am king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah. 
1KI.15.10	And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name 
1KI.15.11	And Asa did 
1KI.15.12	 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 
1KI.15.13	And also Ma´achah his mother, even her he removed from 
1KI.15.14	But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the 
1KI.15.15	And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the 
1KI.15.16	And there was war between Asa and Ba´asha king of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.17	And Ba´asha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
1KI.15.18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold 
1KI.15.19	 a league between me and thee, 
1KI.15.20	So Ben–ha´dad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and A´bel–beth–ma´achah, and all Chin´neroth, with all the land of Naph´tali. 
1KI.15.21	And it came to pass, when Ba´asha heard 
1KI.15.22	Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none 
1KI.15.23	The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, 
1KI.15.24	And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehosh´aphat his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.25	And Nadab the son of Jerobo´am began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years. 
1KI.15.26	And he did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.15.27	And Ba´asha the son of Ahi´jah, of the house of Is´sachar, conspired against him; and Ba´asha smote him at Gib´bethon, which 
1KI.15.28	Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Ba´asha slay him, and reigned in his stead. 
1KI.15.29	 And it came to pass, when he reigned, 
1KI.15.30	because of the sins of Jerobo´am which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the 
1KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, 
1KI.15.32	And there was war between Asa and Ba´asha king of Israel all their days.
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Ba´asha the son of Ahi´jah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years. 
1KI.15.34	And he did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.1	Then the word of the 
1KI.16.2	Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jerobo´am, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; 
1KI.16.3	behold, I will take away the posterity of Ba´asha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jerobo´am the son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	Him that dieth of Ba´asha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
1KI.16.5	Now the rest of the acts of Ba´asha, and what he did, and his might, 
1KI.16.6	So Ba´asha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead. 
1KI.16.7	And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hana´ni came the word of the 
1KI.16.8	In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Ba´asha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. 
1KI.16.9	And his servant Zimri, captain of half 
1KI.16.10	And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.11	And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, 
1KI.16.12	Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Ba´asha, according to the word of the 
1KI.16.13	for all the sins of Ba´asha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the 
1KI.16.14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, 
1KI.16.15	In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people 
1KI.16.16	And the people 
1KI.16.17	And Omri went up from Gib´bethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died, 
1KI.16.19	for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, 
1KI.16.21	Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. 
1KI.16.22	But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. 
1KI.16.23	In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah. 
1KI.16.24	And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
1KI.16.25	But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.16.26	For he walked in all the way of Jerobo´am the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the 
1KI.16.27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, 
1KI.16.28	So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.29	And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 
1KI.16.30	And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.31	And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jerobo´am the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jez´ebel the daughter of Ethba´al king of the Zido´ni-ans, and went and served Ba´al, and worshipped him. 
1KI.16.32	And he reared up an altar for Ba´al in the house of Ba´al, which he had built in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the 
1KI.16.34	 In his days did Hi´el the Beth´–elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abi´ram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest 
1KI.17.2	And the word of the 
1KI.17.3	Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that 
1KI.17.4	And it shall be, 
1KI.17.5	So he went and did according unto the word of the 
1KI.17.6	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 
1KI.17.7	And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
1KI.17.8	And the word of the 
1KI.17.9	 Arise, get thee to Zar´ephath, which 
1KI.17.10	So he arose and went to Zar´ephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman 
1KI.17.11	And as she was going to fetch 
1KI.17.12	And she said, 
1KI.17.13	And Eli´jah said unto her, Fear not; go 
1KI.17.14	For thus saith the 
1KI.17.15	And she went and did according to the saying of Eli´jah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat 
1KI.17.16	 the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the 
1KI.17.17	And it came to pass after these things, 
1KI.17.18	And she said unto Eli´jah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? 
1KI.17.19	And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. 
1KI.17.20	And he cried unto the 
1KI.17.21	And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the 
1KI.17.22	And the 
1KI.17.23	And Eli´jah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Eli´jah said, See, thy son liveth. 
1KI.17.24	And the woman said to Eli´jah, Now by this I know that thou 
1KI.18.1	And it came to pass 
1KI.18.2	And Eli´jah went to show himself unto Ahab. And 
1KI.18.3	And Ahab called Obadi´ah, which 
1KI.18.4	for it was 
1KI.18.5	And Ahab said unto Obadi´ah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. 
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadi´ah went another way by himself.
1KI.18.7	And as Obadi´ah was in the way, behold, Eli´jah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, 
1KI.18.8	And he answered him, I 
1KI.18.9	And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? 
1KI.18.10	 the 
1KI.18.11	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Eli´jah 
1KI.18.12	And it shall come to pass, 
1KI.18.13	Was it not told my lord what I did when Jez´ebel slew the prophets of the 
1KI.18.14	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Eli´jah 
1KI.18.15	And Eli´jah said, 
1KI.18.16	So Obadi´ah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Eli´jah.
1KI.18.17	And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Eli´jah, that Ahab said unto him, 
1KI.18.18	And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the 
1KI.18.19	Now therefore send, 
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	And Eli´jah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the 
1KI.18.22	Then said Eli´jah unto the people, I, 
1KI.18.23	Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay 
1KI.18.24	and call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the 
1KI.18.25	And Eli´jah said unto the prophets of Ba´al, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress 
1KI.18.26	And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed 
1KI.18.27	And it came to pass at noon, that Eli´jah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he 
1KI.18.28	And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. 
1KI.18.29	And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the 
1KI.18.30	And Eli´jah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the 
1KI.18.31	 And Eli´jah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the 
1KI.18.32	and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the 
1KI.18.33	And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid 
1KI.18.34	And he said, Do 
1KI.18.35	And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
1KI.18.36	And it came to pass at 
1KI.18.37	Hear me, O 
1KI.18.38	Then the fire of the 
1KI.18.39	And when all the people saw 
1KI.18.40	And Eli´jah said unto them, Take the prophets of Ba´al; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Eli´jah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
1KI.18.41	And Eli´jah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for 
1KI.18.42	 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Eli´jah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, 
1KI.18.43	and said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, 
1KI.18.44	And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare 
1KI.18.45	And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. 
1KI.18.46	And the hand of the 
1KI.19.1	And Ahab told Jez´ebel all that Eli´jah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. 
1KI.19.2	Then Jez´ebel sent a messenger unto Eli´jah, saying, So let the gods do 
1KI.19.3	And when he saw 
1KI.19.4	But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O 
1KI.19.5	And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise 
1KI.19.6	And he looked, and, behold, 
1KI.19.7	And the angel of the 
1KI.19.8	And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
1KI.19.9	And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the 
1KI.19.10	 And he said, I have been very jealous for the 
1KI.19.11	And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the 
1KI.19.12	and after the earthquake a fire; 
1KI.19.13	And it was 
1KI.19.14	 And he said, I have been very jealous for the 
1KI.19.15	 And the 
1KI.19.16	 and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint 
1KI.19.17	And it shall come to pass, 
1KI.19.18	 Yet I have left 
1KI.19.19	So he departed thence, and found Eli´sha the son of Shaphat, who 
1KI.19.20	And he left the oxen, and ran after Eli´jah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and 
1KI.19.21	And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Eli´jah, and ministered unto him.
1KI.20.1	And Ben–ha´dad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and 
1KI.20.2	And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben–ha´dad, 
1KI.20.3	Thy silver and thy gold 
1KI.20.4	And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I 
1KI.20.5	And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben–ha´dad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 
1KI.20.6	yet I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, 
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this 
1KI.20.8	And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not 
1KI.20.9	Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben–ha´dad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again. 
1KI.20.10	And Ben–ha´dad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me. 
1KI.20.11	And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell 
1KI.20.12	And it came to pass, when 
1KI.20.13	And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.14	And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.15	Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he numbered all the people, 
1KI.20.16	And they went out at noon. But Ben–ha´dad 
1KI.20.17	And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben–ha´dad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria. 
1KI.20.18	And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.
1KI.20.19	So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them. 
1KI.20.20	And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben–ha´dad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen. 
1KI.20.21	And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
1KI.20.22	And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
1KI.20.23	And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods 
1KI.20.24	And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms: 
1KI.20.25	and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, 
1KI.20.26	And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben–ha´dad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. 
1KI.20.27	And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country. 
1KI.20.28	And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.29	And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And 
1KI.20.30	But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and 
1KI.20.30	And Ben–ha´dad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber. 
1KI.20.31	And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel 
1KI.20.32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and 
1KI.20.33	Now the men did diligently observe whether 
1KI.20.34	And 
1KI.20.35	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbor in the word of the 
1KI.20.36	Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the 
1KI.20.37	Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded 
1KI.20.38	So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face. 
1KI.20.39	And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. 
1KI.20.40	And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So 
1KI.20.41	And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he 
1KI.20.42	And he said unto him, Thus saith the 
1KI.20.43	And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.
1KI.21.1	And it came to pass after these things, 
1KI.21.2	And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it 
1KI.21.3	And Naboth said to Ahab, The 
1KI.21.4	And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jez´reelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
1KI.21.5	But Jez´ebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? 
1KI.21.6	And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jez´reelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee 
1KI.21.7	And Jez´ebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, 
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed 
1KI.21.9	And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people: 
1KI.21.10	and set two men, sons of Be´li-al, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And 
1KI.21.11	And the men of his city, 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 
1KI.21.13	And there came in two men, children of Be´li-al, and sat before him: and the men of Be´li-al witnessed against him, 
1KI.21.14	Then they sent to Jez´ebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
1KI.21.15	And it came to pass, when Jez´ebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jez´ebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jez´reelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. 
1KI.21.16	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jez´reelite, to take possession of it.
1KI.21.17	And the word of the 
1KI.21.18	Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which 
1KI.21.19	And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the 
1KI.21.20	And Ahab said to Eli´jah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found 
1KI.21.21	Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 
1KI.21.22	and will make thine house like the house of Jerobo´am the son of Nebat, and like the house of Ba´asha the son of Ahi´jah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked 
1KI.21.23	 And of Jez´ebel also spake the 
1KI.21.24	Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
1KI.21.25	But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the 
1KI.21.26	And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all 
1KI.21.27	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 
1KI.21.28	And the word of the 
1KI.21.29	Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: 
1KI.22.1	And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. 
1KI.22.2	And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehosh´aphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.3	And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gil´e-ad 
1KI.22.4	And he said unto Jehosh´aphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ra´moth–gil´e-ad? And Jehosh´aphat said to the king of Israel, I 
1KI.22.5	And Jehosh´aphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the 
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ra´moth–gil´e-ad to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver 
1KI.22.7	And Jehosh´aphat said, 
1KI.22.8	And the king of Israel said unto Jehosh´aphat, 
1KI.22.9	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten 
1KI.22.10	And the king of Israel and Jehosh´aphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. 
1KI.22.11	And Zedeki´ah the son of Chena´anah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the 
1KI.22.12	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ra´moth–gil´e-ad, and prosper: for the 
1KI.22.13	And the messenger that was gone to call Micai´ah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets 
1KI.22.14	And Micai´ah said, 
1KI.22.15	So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micai´ah, shall we go against Ra´moth–gil´e-ad to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the 
1KI.22.16	And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but 
1KI.22.17	 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the 
1KI.22.18	And the king of Israel said unto Jehosh´aphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? 
1KI.22.19	And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the 
1KI.22.20	And the 
1KI.22.21	And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the 
1KI.22.22	And the 
1KI.22.23	Now therefore, behold, the 
1KI.22.24	But Zedeki´ah the son of Chena´anah went near, and smote Micai´ah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the 
1KI.22.25	And Micai´ah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. 
1KI.22.26	And the king of Israel said, Take Micai´ah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Jo´ash the king's son; 
1KI.22.27	and say, Thus saith the king, Put this 
1KI.22.28	And Micai´ah said, If thou return at all in peace, the 
1KI.22.29	So the king of Israel and Jehosh´aphat the king of Judah went up to Ra´moth–gil´e-ad. 
1KI.22.30	And the king of Israel said unto Jehosh´aphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. 
1KI.22.31	But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.32	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehosh´aphat, that they said, Surely it 
1KI.22.33	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it 
1KI.22.34	And a 
1KI.22.35	And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
1KI.22.37	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. 
1KI.22.38	And 
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahazi´ah his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.22.41	And Jehosh´aphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehosh´aphat 
1KI.22.43	And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing 
1KI.22.44	And Jehosh´aphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehosh´aphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, 
1KI.22.46	And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.
1KI.22.48	Jehosh´aphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at E´zi-on–ge´ber. 
1KI.22.49	Then said Ahazi´ah the son of Ahab unto Jehosh´aphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehosh´aphat would not. 
1KI.22.50	And Jehosh´aphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jeho´ram his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.22.51	Ahazi´ah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehosh´aphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. 
1KI.22.52	And he did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.22.53	for he served Ba´al, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the 
2KI.1.1	Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2KI.1.2	And Ahazi´ah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that 
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the 
2KI.1.4	Now therefore thus saith the 
2KI.1.5	And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back? 
2KI.1.6	And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.1.7	And he said unto them, What manner of man 
2KI.1.8	 And they answered him, 
2KI.1.9	Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down. 
2KI.1.10	 And Eli´jah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I 
2KI.1.11	Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly. 
2KI.1.12	 And Eli´jah answered and said unto them, If I 
2KI.1.13	And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Eli´jah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. 
2KI.1.14	Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight. 
2KI.1.15	And the angel of the 
2KI.1.16	And he said unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.1.17	So he died according to the word of the 
2KI.1.18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahazi´ah which he did, 
2KI.2.1	And it came to pass, when the 
2KI.2.2	And Eli´jah said unto Eli´sha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the 
2KI.2.3	And the sons of the prophets that 
2KI.2.4	And Eli´jah said unto him, Eli´sha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the 
2KI.2.5	And the sons of the prophets that 
2KI.2.6	And Eli´jah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the 
2KI.2.7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. 
2KI.2.8	And Eli´jah took his mantle, and wrapped 
2KI.2.10	And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: 
2KI.2.11	And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, 
2KI.2.12	 And Eli´sha saw 
2KI.2.12	And he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. 
2KI.2.13	He took up also the mantle of Eli´jah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 
2KI.2.14	and he took the mantle of Eli´jah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where 
2KI.2.15	And when the sons of the prophets which 
2KI.2.16	And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the 
2KI.2.17	And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. 
2KI.2.18	And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
2KI.2.19	And the men of the city said unto Eli´sha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city 
2KI.2.20	And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought 
2KI.2.21	And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the 
2KI.2.22	So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Eli´sha which he spake.
2KI.2.23	And he went up from thence unto Beth–el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. 
2KI.2.24	And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Now Jeho´ram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehosh´aphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. 
2KI.3.2	And he wrought evil in the sight of the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jerobo´am the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
2KI.3.4	And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool. 
2KI.3.5	But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	And king Jeho´ram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel. 
2KI.3.7	And he went and sent to Jehosh´aphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I 
2KI.3.8	And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them. 
2KI.3.10	And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the 
2KI.3.11	But Jehosh´aphat said, 
2KI.3.12	And Jehosh´aphat said, The word of the 
2KI.3.13	And Eli´sha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the 
2KI.3.14	And Eli´sha said, 
2KI.3.15	But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the 
2KI.3.16	And he said, Thus saith the 
2KI.3.17	For thus saith the 
2KI.3.18	And this is 
2KI.3.19	And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones. 
2KI.3.20	And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
2KI.3.21	And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood in the border. 
2KI.3.22	And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side 
2KI.3.23	and they said, This 
2KI.3.24	And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in 
2KI.3.25	And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir–har´eseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about 
2KI.3.26	And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through 
2KI.3.27	Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him 
2KI.4.1	Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Eli´sha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the 
2KI.4.2	And Eli´sha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. 
2KI.4.3	Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, 
2KI.4.4	And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full. 
2KI.4.5	So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought 
2KI.4.6	And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, 
2KI.4.7	Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.
2KI.4.8	And it fell on a day, that Eli´sha passed to Shunem, where 
2KI.4.9	And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this 
2KI.4.10	Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
2KI.4.11	And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there. 
2KI.4.12	And he said to Geha´zi his servant, Call this Shu´nammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him. 
2KI.4.13	And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what 
2KI.4.14	And he said, What then 
2KI.4.15	And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door. 
2KI.4.16	And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, 
2KI.4.17	And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Eli´sha had said unto her, according to the time of life.
2KI.4.18	And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. 
2KI.4.19	And he said unto his father, My head, my head! And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother. 
2KI.4.20	And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and 
2KI.4.21	And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut 
2KI.4.22	And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again. 
2KI.4.23	And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him today? 
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not 
2KI.4.25	So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel.
2KI.4.25	And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Geha´zi his servant, Behold, 
2KI.4.26	run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, 
2KI.4.27	And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Geha´zi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul 
2KI.4.28	Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me? 
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Geha´zi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. 
2KI.4.30	And the mother of the child said, 
2KI.4.31	And Geha´zi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but 
2KI.4.32	And when Eli´sha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, 
2KI.4.33	He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the 
2KI.4.34	And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. 
2KI.4.35	Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. 
2KI.4.36	And he called Geha´zi, and said, Call this Shu´nammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son. 
2KI.4.37	Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
2KI.4.38	And Eli´sha came again to Gilgal: and 
2KI.4.39	And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred 
2KI.4.40	So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O 
2KI.4.41	But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast 
2KI.4.42	And there came a man from Ba´al–shali´sha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat. 
2KI.4.43	And his servitor said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the 
2KI.4.44	So he set 
2KI.5.2	And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Na´aman's wife. 
2KI.5.3	And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord 
2KI.5.4	And 
2KI.5.5	And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.
2KI.5.5	And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand 
2KI.5.6	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have 
2KI.5.7	And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, 
2KI.5.8	And it was 
2KI.5.9	So Na´aman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Eli´sha. 
2KI.5.10	And Eli´sha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean. 
2KI.5.11	But Na´aman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the 
2KI.5.12	 not Aba´na and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. 
2KI.5.13	And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, 
2KI.5.14	Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
2KI.5.15	And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that 
2KI.5.16	But he said, 
2KI.5.17	And Na´aman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the 
2KI.5.18	In this thing the 
2KI.5.19	And he said unto him, Go in peace.
2KI.5.19	So he departed from him a little way. 
2KI.5.20	But Geha´zi, the servant of Eli´sha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Na´aman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, 
2KI.5.21	So Geha´zi followed after Na´aman. And when Na´aman saw 
2KI.5.22	And he said, All 
2KI.5.23	And Na´aman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid 
2KI.5.24	And when he came to the tower, he took 
2KI.5.25	But he went in, and stood before his master. And Eli´sha said unto him, Whence 
2KI.5.26	And he said unto him, Went not mine heart 
2KI.5.27	The leprosy therefore of Na´aman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper 
2KI.6.1	And the sons of the prophets said unto Eli´sha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. 
2KI.6.2	Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye. 
2KI.6.3	And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go. 
2KI.6.4	So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood. 
2KI.6.5	But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed. 
2KI.6.6	And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast 
2KI.6.7	Therefore said he, Take 
2KI.6.8	Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place 
2KI.6.9	And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down. 
2KI.6.10	And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
2KI.6.11	Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us 
2KI.6.12	And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Eli´sha, the prophet that 
2KI.6.13	And he said, Go and spy where he 
2KI.6.14	Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
2KI.6.15	And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? 
2KI.6.16	And he answered, Fear not: for they that 
2KI.6.17	And Eli´sha prayed, and said, 
2KI.6.18	And when they came down to him, Eli´sha prayed unto the 
2KI.6.19	And Eli´sha said unto them, This 
2KI.6.20	And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Eli´sha said, 
2KI.6.21	And the king of Israel said unto Eli´sha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite 
2KI.6.22	And he answered, Thou shalt not smite 
2KI.6.23	And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
2KI.6.24	And it came to pass after this, that Ben–ha´dad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was 
2KI.6.26	And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. 
2KI.6.27	And he said, If the 
2KI.6.28	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow. 
2KI.6.29	 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son. 
2KI.6.30	And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, 
2KI.6.31	Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Eli´sha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
2KI.6.32	But Eli´sha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and 
2KI.6.33	And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil 
2KI.7.1	Then Eli´sha said, Hear ye the word of the 
2KI.7.2	Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, 
2KI.7.3	And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? 
2KI.7.4	If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine 
2KI.7.5	And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, 
2KI.7.6	For the 
2KI.7.7	Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it 
2KI.7.8	And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid 
2KI.7.9	Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day 
2KI.7.10	So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, 
2KI.7.11	And he called the porters; and they told 
2KI.7.12	And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we 
2KI.7.13	And one of his servants answered and said, Let 
2KI.7.14	They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see. 
2KI.7.15	And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way 
2KI.7.16	And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was 
2KI.7.17	And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him. 
2KI.7.18	And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria: 
2KI.7.19	and that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, 
2KI.7.20	And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.
2KI.8.2	And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. 
2KI.8.3	And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land. 
2KI.8.4	And the king talked with Geha´zi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Eli´sha hath done. 
2KI.8.5	And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Geha´zi said, My lord, O king, this 
2KI.8.6	And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that 
2KI.8.7	And Eli´sha came to Damascus; and Ben–ha´dad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither. 
2KI.8.8	And the king said unto Haz´a-el, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the 
2KI.8.9	So Haz´a-el went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben–ha´dad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? 
2KI.8.10	And Eli´sha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the 
2KI.8.11	And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept. 
2KI.8.12	And Haz´a-el said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child. 
2KI.8.13	 And Haz´a-el said, But what, 
2KI.8.14	So he departed from Eli´sha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Eli´sha to thee? And he answered, He told me 
2KI.8.15	And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped 
2KI.8.16	And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehosh´aphat 
2KI.8.17	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2KI.8.18	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.19	 Yet the 
2KI.8.21	So Joram went over to Za´ir, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents. 
2KI.8.22	Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. 
2KI.8.23	And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, 
2KI.8.24	And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahazi´ah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahazi´ah the son of Jeho´ram king of Judah begin to reign. 
2KI.8.26	Two and twenty years old 
2KI.8.27	And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.28	And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Haz´a-el king of Syria in Ra´moth–gil´e-ad; and the Syrians wounded Joram. 
2KI.8.29	And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Haz´a-el king of Syria. And Ahazi´ah the son of Jeho´ram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2KI.9.1	And Eli´sha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ra´moth–gil´e-ad: 
2KI.9.2	and when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehosh´aphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber; 
2KI.9.3	then take the box of oil, and pour 
2KI.9.4	So the young man, 
2KI.9.5	And when he came, behold, the captains of the host 
2KI.9.6	 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.9.7	And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the 
2KI.9.8	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel: 
2KI.9.9	and I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jerobo´am the son of Nebat, and like the house of Ba´asha the son of Ahi´jah: 
2KI.9.10	 and the dogs shall eat Jez´ebel in the portion of Jezreel, and 
2KI.9.11	Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and 
2KI.9.12	And they said, 
2KI.9.13	Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put 
2KI.9.14	So Jehu the son of Jehosh´aphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ra´moth–gil´e-ad, he and all Israel, because of Haz´a-el king of Syria. 
2KI.9.15	But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Haz´a-el king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, 
2KI.9.16	So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahazi´ah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
2KI.9.17	And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, 
2KI.9.18	So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, 
2KI.9.19	Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, 
2KI.9.20	And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving 
2KI.9.21	And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahazi´ah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jez´reelite. 
2KI.9.22	And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, 
2KI.9.23	And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahazi´ah, 
2KI.9.24	And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jeho´ram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. 
2KI.9.25	Then said 
2KI.9.26	 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the 
2KI.9.27	But when Ahazi´ah the king of Judah saw 
2KI.9.28	And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
2KI.9.29	And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahazi´ah to reign over Judah.
2KI.9.30	And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jez´ebel heard 
2KI.9.31	And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, 
2KI.9.32	And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who 
2KI.9.33	And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and 
2KI.9.34	And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed 
2KI.9.35	And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of 
2KI.9.36	 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This 
2KI.9.37	And the carcass of Jez´ebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; 
2KI.10.1	And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's 
2KI.10.2	Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons 
2KI.10.3	look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set 
2KI.10.4	But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand? 
2KI.10.5	And he that 
2KI.10.6	Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye 
2KI.10.7	And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him 
2KI.10.8	And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning. 
2KI.10.9	And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye 
2KI.10.10	Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the 
2KI.10.11	 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolk, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
2KI.10.12	And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. 
2KI.10.13	Jehu met with the brethren of Ahazi´ah king of Judah, and said, Who 
2KI.10.14	And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, 
2KI.10.15	And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehon´adab the son of Rechab 
2KI.10.16	And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the 
2KI.10.17	And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the 
2KI.10.18	And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Ba´al a little; 
2KI.10.19	Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Ba´al, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice 
2KI.10.20	And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Ba´al. And they proclaimed 
2KI.10.21	And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Ba´al came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Ba´al; and the house of Ba´al was full from one end to another. 
2KI.10.22	And he said unto him that 
2KI.10.23	And Jehu went, and Jehon´adab the son of Rechab, into the house of Ba´al, and said unto the worshippers of Ba´al, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the 
2KI.10.24	And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, 
2KI.10.25	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, 
2KI.10.26	And they brought forth the images out of the house of Ba´al, and burned them. 
2KI.10.27	And they brake down the image of Ba´al, and brake down the house of Ba´al, and made it a draught house unto this day.
2KI.10.28	Thus Jehu destroyed Ba´al out of Israel. 
2KI.10.29	 Howbeit, 
2KI.10.30	And the 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the 
2KI.10.32	In those days the 
2KI.10.33	from Jordan eastward, all the land of Gil´e-ad, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manas´sites, from Aro´er, which 
2KI.10.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, 
2KI.10.35	And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jeho´ahaz his son reigned in his stead. 
2KI.10.36	And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria 
2KI.11.1	And when Athali´ah the mother of Ahazi´ah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. 
2KI.11.2	But Jehosh´eba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahazi´ah, took Jo´ash the son of Ahazi´ah, and stole him from among the king's sons 
2KI.11.3	And he was with her hid in the house of the 
2KI.11.4	And the seventh year Jehoi´ada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the 
2KI.11.5	And he commanded them, saying, This 
2KI.11.6	and a third part 
2KI.11.7	And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the 
2KI.11.8	And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.
2KI.11.9	And the captains over the hundreds did according to all 
2KI.11.10	And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that 
2KI.11.11	And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, 
2KI.11.12	And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and 
2KI.11.13	And when Athali´ah heard the noise of the guard 
2KI.11.14	And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner 
2KI.11.15	But Jehoi´ada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges; and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the 
2KI.11.16	And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.
2KI.11.17	And Jehoi´ada made a covenant between the

2KI.12.16	 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the

2KI.12.18	And Jeho´ash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehosh´aphat, and Jeho´ram, and Ahazi´ah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the

2KI.13.18	And he said, Take the arrows. And he took 
2KI.13.19	And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed 
2KI.13.20	And Eli´sha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. 
2KI.13.21	And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band 
2KI.13.22	But Haz´a-el king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jeho´ahaz.

2KI.14.9	And Jeho´ash the king of Israel sent to Amazi´ah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that 
2KI.14.10	Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory

2KI.17.4	And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshe´a: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as 
2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. 
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshe´a the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor 
2KI.17.7	For 
2KI.17.8	and walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the 
2KI.17.9	And the children of Israel did secretly 
2KI.17.10	 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree: 
2KI.17.11	and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as 
2KI.17.12	for they served idols, whereof the 
2KI.17.13	Yet the 
2KI.17.14	Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the 
2KI.17.15	And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that 
2KI.17.16	 And they left all the commandments of the 
2KI.17.17	 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the 
2KI.17.18	Therefore the 
2KI.17.19	Also Judah kept not the commandments of the 
2KI.17.20	And the 
2KI.17.21	For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jerobo´am the son of Nebat king: and Jerobo´am drave Israel from following the 
2KI.17.22	For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jerobo´am which he did; they departed not from them; 
2KI.17.23	until the 
2KI.17.24	And the king of Assyria brought 
2KI.17.25	And 
2KI.17.26	Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land. 
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land. 
2KI.17.28	Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth–el, and taught them how they should fear the 
2KI.17.29	Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put 
2KI.17.30	And the men of Babylon made Suc´coth–be´noth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashi´ma, 
2KI.17.31	and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Seph´arvites burnt their children in fire to Adram´melech and Anam´melech, the gods of Sepharva´im. 
2KI.17.32	So they feared the 
2KI.17.33	They feared the 
2KI.17.34	 Unto this day they do after the former manners.
2KI.17.34	They fear not the 
2KI.17.35	 with whom the 
2KI.17.36	 but the 
2KI.17.37	And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods. 
2KI.17.38	And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods. 
2KI.17.39	But the 
2KI.17.40	Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
2KI.17.41	So these nations feared the 
2KI.18.1	Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshe´a son of Elah king of Israel, 
2KI.18.2	Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also 
2KI.18.3	And he did 
2KI.18.4	 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehush´tan.
2KI.18.5	He trusted in the 
2KI.18.6	For he clave to the 
2KI.18.7	And the 
2KI.18.8	He smote the Philistines, 
2KI.18.9	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezeki´ah, which 
2KI.18.10	And at the end of three years they took it: 
2KI.18.11	And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor 
2KI.18.12	because they obeyed not the voice of the 
2KI.18.13	Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezeki´ah did Sennach´erib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them. 
2KI.18.14	And Hezeki´ah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezeki´ah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 
2KI.18.15	And Hezeki´ah gave 
2KI.18.16	At that time did Hezeki´ah cut off 
2KI.18.17	And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab–sa´ris and Rab–sha´keh from Lachish to king Hezeki´ah with a great host against Jerusalem: and they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which 
2KI.18.18	And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eli´akim the son of Hilki´ah, which 
2KI.18.19	And Rab–sha´keh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezeki´ah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence 
2KI.18.20	Thou sayest, (but 
2KI.18.21	Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, 
2KI.18.22	But if ye say unto me, We trust in the 
2KI.18.23	Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 
2KI.18.24	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
2KI.18.25	Am I now come up without the 
2KI.18.26	Then said Eli´akim the son of Hilki´ah, and Shebna, and Jo´ah, unto Rab–sha´keh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian
2KI.18.27	But Rab–sha´keh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? 
2KI.18.28	Then Rab–sha´keh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria: 
2KI.18.29	thus saith the king, Let not Hezeki´ah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand: 
2KI.18.30	neither let Hezeki´ah make you trust in the 
2KI.18.31	Hearken not to Hezeki´ah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make 
2KI.18.32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezeki´ah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The 
2KI.18.33	Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where 
2KI.18.35	Who 
2KI.18.36	But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. 
2KI.18.37	Then came Eli´akim the son of Hilki´ah, which 
2KI.19.1	And it came to pass, when king Hezeki´ah heard 
2KI.19.2	And he sent Eli´akim, which 
2KI.19.3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezeki´ah, This day 
2KI.19.4	It may be the 
2KI.19.5	So the servants of king Hezeki´ah came to Isaiah. 
2KI.19.6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the 
2KI.19.7	Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
2KI.19.8	So Rab–sha´keh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 
2KI.19.9	And when he heard say of Tirha´kah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee; he sent messengers again unto Hezeki´ah, saying, 
2KI.19.10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezeki´ah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
2KI.19.11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered? 
2KI.19.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; 
2KI.19.13	Where 
2KI.19.14	And Hezeki´ah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezeki´ah went up into the house of the 
2KI.19.15	 And Hezeki´ah prayed before the 
2KI.19.16	, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, 
2KI.19.17	Of a truth, 
2KI.19.18	and have cast their gods into the fire: for they 
2KI.19.19	Now therefore, O 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezeki´ah, saying, Thus saith the 
2KI.19.21	This 
2KI.19.22	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted 
2KI.19.23	By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, 
2KI.19.24	I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
2KI.19.25	Hast thou not heard long ago 
2KI.19.26	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were 
2KI.19.27	But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. 
2KI.19.28	Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
2KI.19.29	And this 
2KI.19.30	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. 
2KI.19.31	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the 
2KI.19.32	Therefore thus saith the 
2KI.19.33	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the 
2KI.19.34	For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
2KI.19.35	And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the 
2KI.19.36	So Sennach´erib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nin´eveh. 
2KI.19.37	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adram´melech and Share´zer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar–had´don his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.20.1	In those days was Hezeki´ah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.20.2	Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the 
2KI.20.3	I beseech thee, O 
2KI.20.4	And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the 
2KI.20.5	Turn again, and tell Hezeki´ah the captain of my people, Thus saith the 
2KI.20.6	And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. 
2KI.20.7	And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid 
2KI.20.8	And Hezeki´ah said unto Isaiah, What 
2KI.20.9	And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the 
2KI.20.10	And Hezeki´ah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees. 
2KI.20.11	And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the 
2KI.20.12	At that time Ber´odach–bal´adan, the son of Bal´adan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezeki´ah: for he had heard that Hezeki´ah had been sick. 
2KI.20.13	And Hezeki´ah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and 
2KI.20.14	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezeki´ah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezeki´ah said, They are come from a far country, 
2KI.20.15	And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezeki´ah answered, All 
2KI.20.16	And Isaiah said unto Hezeki´ah, Hear the word of the 
2KI.20.17	 Behold, the days come, that all that 
2KI.20.18	 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. 
2KI.20.19	Then said Hezeki´ah unto Isaiah, Good 
2KI.20.20	And the rest of the acts of Hezeki´ah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, 
2KI.20.21	And Hezeki´ah slept with his fathers: and Manas´seh his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.21.1	Manas´seh 
2KI.21.2	 And he did 
2KI.21.3	For he built up again the high places which Hezeki´ah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Ba´al, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 
2KI.21.4	 And he built altars in the house of the 
2KI.21.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the 
2KI.21.6	And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the 
2KI.21.7	 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the 
2KI.21.8	neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them. 
2KI.21.9	But they hearkened not: and Manas´seh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the 
2KI.21.10	And the 
2KI.21.11	Because Manas´seh king of Judah hath done these abominations, 
2KI.21.12	therefore thus saith the 
2KI.21.13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as 
2KI.21.14	And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; 
2KI.21.15	because they have done 
2KI.21.16	Moreover Manas´seh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing 
2KI.21.17	Now the rest of the acts of Manas´seh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, 
2KI.21.18	And Manas´seh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.21.19	Amon 
2KI.21.20	And he did 
2KI.21.21	And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 
2KI.21.22	and he forsook the 
2KI.21.23	And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house. 
2KI.21.24	And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josi´ah his son king in his stead. 
2KI.21.25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, 
2KI.21.26	And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josi´ah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.22.2	And he did 
2KI.22.3	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josi´ah, 
2KI.22.4	Go up to Hilki´ah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the 
2KI.22.5	and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.22.6	unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house. 
2KI.22.7	Howbeit, there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
2KI.22.8	And Hilki´ah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the 
2KI.22.9	And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.22.10	And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilki´ah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
2KI.22.11	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes. 
2KI.22.12	And the king commanded Hilki´ah the priest, and Ahi´kam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michai´ah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahi´ah a servant of the king's, saying, 
2KI.22.13	Go ye, inquire of the 
2KI.22.14	So Hilki´ah the priest, and Ahi´kam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahi´ah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her. 
2KI.22.15	And she said unto them, Thus saith the 
2KI.22.16	Thus saith the 
2KI.22.17	because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched. 
2KI.22.18	But to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the 
2KI.22.19	because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the 
2KI.22.20	Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.
2KI.23.1	And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.2	And the king went up into the house of the 
2KI.23.3	And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the 
2KI.23.5	And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Ba´al, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven. 
2KI.23.6	And he brought out the grove from the house of the 
2KI.23.7	And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that 
2KI.23.8	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer–sheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that 
2KI.23.9	Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the 
2KI.23.10	 And he defiled Topheth, which 
2KI.23.11	And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the 
2KI.23.12	 And the altars that 
2KI.23.13	 And the high places that 
2KI.23.14	And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
2KI.23.16	 And as Josi´ah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that 
2KI.23.17	 Then he said, What title 
2KI.23.18	And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. 
2KI.23.19	And all the houses also of the high places that 
2KI.23.20	And he slew all the priests of the high places that 
2KI.23.21	And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the 
2KI.23.22	Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; 
2KI.23.23	but in the eighteenth year of king Josi´ah, 
2KI.23.24	Moreover the 
2KI.23.25	And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the 
2KI.23.26	Notwithstanding, the 
2KI.23.27	And the 
2KI.23.28	Now the rest of the acts of Josi´ah, and all that he did, 
2KI.23.29	In his days Pha´raoh–ne´choh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphra´tes: and king Josi´ah went against him; and he slew him at Megid´do, when he had seen him. 
2KI.23.30	And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megid´do, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jeho´ahaz the son of Josi´ah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
2KI.23.31	Jeho´ahaz 
2KI.23.32	And he did 
2KI.23.33	And Pha´raoh–ne´choh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. 
2KI.23.34	 And Pha´raoh–ne´choh made Eli´akim the son of Josi´ah king in the room of Josi´ah his father, and turned his name to Jehoi´akim, and took Jeho´ahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there. 
2KI.23.35	And Jehoi´akim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give 
2KI.23.37	And he did 
2KI.24.2	And the 
2KI.24.3	Surely at the commandment of the 
2KI.24.4	and also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the 
2KI.24.5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoi´akim, and all that he did, 
2KI.24.6	So Jehoi´akim slept with his fathers: and Jehoi´achin his son reigned in his stead. 
2KI.24.7	And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphra´tes all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
2KI.24.8	Jehoi´achin 
2KI.24.9	And he did 
2KI.24.10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnez´zar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. 
2KI.24.11	And Nebuchadnez´zar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it. 
2KI.24.12	 And Jehoi´achin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. 
2KI.24.13	And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the 
2KI.24.14	And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, 
2KI.24.15	 And he carried away Jehoi´achin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, 
2KI.24.16	And all the men of might, 
2KI.24.17	 And the king of Babylon made Mattani´ah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedeki´ah.
2KI.24.19	And he did 
2KI.24.20	 For through the anger of the 
2KI.25.2	And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedeki´ah. 
2KI.25.3	And on the ninth 
2KI.25.4	 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war 
2KI.25.5	And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him. 
2KI.25.6	So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him. 
2KI.25.7	 And they slew the sons of Zedeki´ah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedeki´ah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	And in the fifth month, on the seventh 
2KI.25.9	 and he burnt the house of the 
2KI.25.10	And all the army of the Chaldees, that 
2KI.25.11	Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Neb´uzar–a´dan the captain of the guard carry away. 
2KI.25.12	But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land 
2KI.25.14	 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. 
2KI.25.15	And the firepans, and the bowls, 
2KI.25.16	The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the 
2KI.25.17	The height of the one pillar 
2KI.25.18	And the captain of the guard took Serai´ah the chief priest, and Zephani´ah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 
2KI.25.19	and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land 
2KI.25.20	and Neb´uzar–a´dan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah: 
2KI.25.21	and the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.
2KI.25.23	And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedali´ah governor, there came to Gedali´ah to Mizpah, even Ish´ma-el the son of Nethani´ah, and Jo´hanan the son of Care´ah, and Serai´ah the son of Tan´humeth the Netoph´athite, and Ja-azani´ah the son of a Ma-ach´athite, they and their men. 
2KI.25.24	And Gedali´ah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you. 
2KI.25.25	 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ish´ma-el the son of Nethani´ah, the son of Elish´ama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedali´ah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah. 
2KI.25.26	 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
2KI.25.27	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoi´achin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth 
2KI.25.28	and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that

1CH.10.4	Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. 
1CH.10.5	And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.

1CH.10.10	And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. 
1CH.10.11	And when all Ja´besh–gil´e-ad heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1CH.10.12	they arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
1CH.10.14	and inquired not of the

1CH.11.6	And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jeb´usites first shall be chief and captain. So Jo´ab the son of Zeru-i´ah went first up, and was chief. 
1CH.11.7	And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David. 
1CH.11.8	And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Jo´ab repaired the rest of the city. 
1CH.11.9	So David waxed greater and greater: for the

1CH.11.18	And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that 
1CH.11.19	and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with 
1CH.11.20	And Ab´ishai the brother of Jo´ab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew 
1CH.11.21	Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the 
1CH.11.22	Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada, the son of a valiant man of Kab´zeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.

1CH.12.38	All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel 
1CH.12.39	And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them. 
1CH.12.40	Moreover they that were nigh them, 
1CH.13.1	And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, 
1CH.13.2	And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If 
1CH.13.3	and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul. 
1CH.13.4	And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
1CH.13.6	 And David went up, and all Israel, to Ba´alah, 
1CH.13.7	And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abin´adab: and Uzza and Ahi´o drave the cart. 
1CH.13.8	And David and all Israel played before God with all 
1CH.13.9	And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. 
1CH.13.10	And the anger of the 
1CH.13.11	And David was displeased, because the 
1CH.13.12	And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God 
1CH.13.13	So David brought not the ark 
1CH.13.14	 And the ark of God remained with the family of O´bed–e´dom in his house three months. And the 
1CH.14.1	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house. 
1CH.14.2	And David perceived that the 
1CH.14.3	And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.

1CH.14.7	and Elish´ama, and Beeli´ada, and Eliph´alet.
1CH.14.8	And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard 
1CH.14.9	And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Reph´a-im. 
1CH.14.10	And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the 
1CH.14.11	So they came up to Ba´al–per´azim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Ba´al–per´azim.
1CH.14.12	And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.
1CH.14.13	And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. 
1CH.14.14	Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 
1CH.14.15	And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, 
1CH.14.16	David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. 
1CH.14.17	And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the 
1CH.15.1	And 
1CH.15.2	 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the 
1CH.15.3	And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.4	And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

1CH.15.10	of the sons of Uz´zi-el; Ammin´adab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve. 
1CH.15.11	And David called for Zadok and Abi´athar the priests, and for the Levites, for U´ri-el, Asai´ah, and Joel, Shemai´ah, and El´i-el, and Ammin´adab, 
1CH.15.12	and said unto them, Ye 
1CH.15.13	For because ye 
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.15	 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded, according to the word of the 
1CH.15.16	And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren 
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechi´ah; and of the sons of Mera´ri their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushai´ah;

1CH.15.24	And Shebani´ah, and Jehosh´aphat, and Nethan´e-el, and Ama´sai, and Zechari´ah, and Benai´ah, and Eli-e´zer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and O´bed–e´dom and Jehi´ah 
1CH.15.25	So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.26	And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.27	And David 
1CH.15.28	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.29	And it came to pass, 
1CH.16.1	So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. 
1CH.16.2	And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
1CH.16.3	And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon 
1CH.16.4	And he appointed 
1CH.16.5	Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechari´ah, Je-i´el, and Shemir´amoth, and Jehi´el, and Mattithi´ah, and Eli´ab, and Benai´ah, and O´bed–e´dom: and Je-i´el with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; 
1CH.16.6	Benai´ah also and Jaha´zi-el the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
1CH.16.7	Then on that day David delivered first 
1CH.16.8	Give thanks unto the 
1CH.16.8	call upon his name,
1CH.16.8	make known his deeds among the people.
1CH.16.9	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him,
1CH.16.9	talk ye of all his wondrous works.
1CH.16.10	Glory ye in his holy name:
1CH.16.10	let the heart of them rejoice
1CH.16.10	that seek the 
1CH.16.11	Seek the 
1CH.16.11	seek his face continually.
1CH.16.12	Remember his marvelous works that he hath done,
1CH.16.12	his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
1CH.16.13	O ye seed of Israel his servant,
1CH.16.13	ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
1CH.16.14	He

1CH.16.15	Be ye mindful always of his covenant;
1CH.16.15	the word 
1CH.16.16	and of his oath unto Isaac;
1CH.16.18	saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
1CH.16.18	the lot of your inheritance.
1CH.16.19	When ye were but few,
1CH.16.19	even a few, and strangers in it,
1CH.16.20	and 
1CH.16.20	and from 
1CH.16.21	yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
1CH.16.22	and do my prophets no harm.
1CH.16.23	Sing unto the 
1CH.16.23	show forth from day to day his salvation.
1CH.16.24	Declare his glory among the heathen;
1CH.16.24	his marvelous works among all nations.
1CH.16.25	For great 
1CH.16.25	he also 
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the people 
1CH.16.26	but the 
1CH.16.27	Glory and honor 
1CH.16.27	strength and gladness 
1CH.16.28	Give unto the 
1CH.16.28	give unto the 
1CH.16.29	Give unto the 
1CH.16.29	bring an offering, and come before him:
1CH.16.29	worship the 
1CH.16.30	Fear before him, all the earth:
1CH.16.30	the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice:
1CH.16.31	and let 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof:
1CH.16.32	let the fields rejoice, and all that 
1CH.16.33	Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the 
1CH.16.33	because he cometh to judge the earth.
1CH.16.34	for his mercy 
1CH.16.35	And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation,
1CH.16.35	and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen,
1CH.16.35	that we may give thanks to thy holy name,
1CH.16.36	Blessed 
1CH.16.36	for ever and ever.
1CH.16.36	And all the people said, Amen, and praised the 
1CH.16.37	So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.38	and O´bed–e´dom with their brethren, threescore and eight; O´bed–e´dom also the son of Jedu´thun and Hosah 
1CH.16.39	and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the 
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings unto the 
1CH.16.41	and with them Heman and Jedu´thun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.42	and with them Heman and Jedu´thun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jedu´thun 
1CH.17.1	Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.17.2	Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that 
1CH.17.3	And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
1CH.17.4	Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the 
1CH.17.5	for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from 
1CH.17.6	Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars? 
1CH.17.7	Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the 
1CH.17.8	and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that 
1CH.17.9	Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, 
1CH.17.10	and since the time that I commanded judges 
1CH.17.11	And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go 
1CH.17.12	He shall build me a house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. 
1CH.17.13	 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took 
1CH.17.14	but I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. 
1CH.17.15	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
1CH.17.16	And David the king came and sat before the 
1CH.17.17	And 
1CH.17.18	What can David 
1CH.17.19	O 
1CH.17.20	O 
1CH.17.21	And what one nation in the earth 
1CH.17.22	For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, 
1CH.17.23	Therefore now, 
1CH.17.24	Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The 
1CH.17.25	For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore thy servant hath found 
1CH.17.26	And now, 
1CH.17.27	now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O 
1CH.18.1	Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
1CH.18.2	And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, 
1CH.18.3	And David smote Hadare´zer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphra´tes. 
1CH.18.4	And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot 
1CH.18.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadare´zer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
1CH.18.6	Then David put 
1CH.18.7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadare´zer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadare´zer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
1CH.18.9	Now when To´u king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadare´zer king of Zobah; 
1CH.18.10	he sent Hador´am his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadare´zer, and smitten him; (for Hadare´zer had war with To´u;) and 
1CH.18.11	Them also king David dedicated unto the 
1CH.18.13	And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the 
1CH.18.14	So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. 
1CH.18.15	And Jo´ab the son of Zeru-i´ah 
1CH.18.16	and Zadok the son of Ahi´tub, and Abim´elech the son of Abi´athar, 
1CH.18.17	and Benai´ah the son of Jehoi´ada 
1CH.19.1	Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 
1CH.19.2	And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. 
1CH.19.3	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? 
1CH.19.4	Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. 
1CH.19.5	Then there went 
1CH.19.6	And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopota´mi-a and out of Syria–ma´achah, and out of Zobah. 
1CH.19.7	So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Ma´achah and his people; who came and pitched before Me´deba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 
1CH.19.8	And when David heard 
1CH.19.9	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come 
1CH.19.10	Now when Jo´ab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put 
1CH.19.11	And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Ab´ishai his brother, and they set 
1CH.19.12	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee. 
1CH.19.13	Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the 
1CH.19.14	So Jo´ab and the people that 
1CH.19.15	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Ab´ishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Jo´ab came to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that 
1CH.19.17	And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set 
1CH.19.18	But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand 
1CH.19.19	And when the servants of Hadare´zer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
1CH.20.2	And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and 
1CH.20.3	And he brought out the people that 
1CH.20.4	And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sib´bechai the Hu´shathite slew Sip´pai, 
1CH.20.5	 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elha´nan the son of Ja´ir slew Lahmi the brother of Goli´ath the Gittite, whose spear staff 
1CH.20.6	And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of 
1CH.20.7	But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shim´e-a David's brother slew him. 
1CH.20.8	These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
1CH.21.1	And Satan
1CH.21.2	And David said to Jo´ab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer–sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know 
1CH.21.3	And Jo´ab answered, The 
1CH.21.4	Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Jo´ab. Wherefore Jo´ab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	And Jo´ab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all 
1CH.21.6	But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Jo´ab.
1CH.21.7	And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel. 
1CH.21.8	And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. 
1CH.21.9	And the 
1CH.21.10	Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the 
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
1CH.21.12	either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh 
1CH.21.13	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the 
1CH.21.16	And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the 
1CH.21.17	And David said unto God, 
1CH.21.18	Then the angel of the 
1CH.21.19	And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the 
1CH.21.20	And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
1CH.21.21	And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with 
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of 
1CH.21.23	And Ornan said unto David, Take 
1CH.21.24	And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take 
1CH.21.25	So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 
1CH.21.26	And David built there an altar unto the 
1CH.21.27	And the 
1CH.21.28	At that time when David saw that the 
1CH.21.29	For the tabernacle of the 
1CH.21.30	But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the 
1CH.22.1	Then David said, This 
1CH.22.2	And David commanded to gather together the strangers that 
1CH.22.3	And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; 
1CH.22.4	also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zido´ni-ans and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. 
1CH.22.5	And David said, Solomon my son 
1CH.22.6	Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the 
1CH.22.7	 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the 
1CH.22.8	but the word of the 
1CH.22.9	Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. 
1CH.22.10	He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I 
1CH.22.11	Now, my son, the 
1CH.22.12	Only the 
1CH.22.13	 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the 
1CH.22.14	Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the 
1CH.22.15	Moreover, 
1CH.22.16	Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, 
1CH.22.17	David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, 
1CH.22.18	 not the 
1CH.22.19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek the 
1CH.23.2	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
1CH.23.3	Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. 
1CH.23.4	Of which, twenty and four thousand 
1CH.23.5	moreover four thousand 
1CH.23.6	And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, 
1CH.23.7	Of the Ger´shonites 
1CH.23.8	The sons of La´adan; the chief 
1CH.23.9	The sons of Shim´e-i; Shelo´mith, and Haz´i-el, and Haran, three. These 
1CH.23.10	And the sons of Shim´e-i 
1CH.23.11	And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Je´ush and Beri´ah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to 
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uz´zi-el, four. 
1CH.23.13	 The sons of Amram; Aaron, and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the 
1CH.23.14	Now 
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses 
1CH.23.16	Of the sons of Gershom, She´bu-el 
1CH.23.17	And the sons of Eli-e´zer 
1CH.23.18	Of the sons of Izhar; Shelo´mith the chief. 
1CH.23.19	Of the sons of Hebron; Jeri´ah the first, Amari´ah the second, Jaha´zi-el the third, and Jekame´am the fourth. 
1CH.23.20	Of the sons of Uz´zi-el; Micah the first, and Jesi´ah the second.
1CH.23.21	The sons of Mera´ri; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Ele-a´zar, and Kish. 
1CH.23.22	And Ele-a´zar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them. 
1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jer´emoth, three.
1CH.23.24	These 
1CH.23.25	For David said, The 
1CH.23.26	 and also unto the Levites: they shall no 
1CH.23.27	For by the last words of David the Levites 
1CH.23.28	 because their office 
1CH.23.29	both for the showbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for 
1CH.23.30	and to stand every morning to thank and praise the 
1CH.23.31	and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the 
1CH.23.32	and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy 
1CH.24.1	Now 
1CH.24.2	 But Nadab and Abi´hu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Ele-a´zar and Ith´amar executed the priest's office. 
1CH.24.3	And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Ele-a´zar, and Ahim´elech of the sons of Ith´amar, according to their offices in their service. 
1CH.24.4	And there were more chief men found of the sons of Ele-a´zar than of the sons of Ith´amar; and 
1CH.24.5	Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors 
1CH.24.6	And Shemai´ah the son of Nethan´e-el the scribe, 
1CH.24.7	Now the first lot came forth to Jehoi´arib, the second to Jedai´ah, 
1CH.24.8	the third to Harim, the fourth to Se-o´rim, 
1CH.24.9	the fifth to Malchi´jah, the sixth to Mij´amin,

1CH.24.24	 the sons of Uz´zi-el; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir. 
1CH.24.25	The brother of Michah 
1CH.24.26	The sons of Mera´ri 
1CH.24.27	The sons of Mera´ri by Ja-azi´ah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. 
1CH.24.28	Of Mahli 
1CH.24.29	Concerning Kish: the son of Kish 
1CH.24.30	The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jer´imoth. These 
1CH.24.31	These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahim´elech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.
1CH.25.1	Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jedu´thun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was: 
1CH.25.2	of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethani´ah, and Asare´lah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king. 
1CH.25.3	Of Jedu´thun: the sons of Jedu´thun; Gedali´ah, and Zeri, and Jeshai´ah, Hashabi´ah, and Mattithi´ah, six,

1CH.25.5	all these 
1CH.25.6	All these 
1CH.25.7	So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the 
1CH.25.8	And they cast lots, ward against 
1CH.25.9	Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedali´ah, who with his brethren and sons

1CH.28.2	 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: 
1CH.28.3	but God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou 
1CH.28.4	Howbeit the 
1CH.28.5	and of all my sons, (for the 
1CH.28.6	And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him 
1CH.28.7	Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day. 
1CH.28.8	Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the 
1CH.28.9	And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the 
1CH.28.10	Take heed now; for the 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlors thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat, 
1CH.28.12	and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of the 
1CH.28.13	also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the 
1CH.28.14	 of gold by weight for 
1CH.28.15	even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, 
1CH.28.16	And by weight 
1CH.28.17	also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basins 
1CH.28.18	and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out 
1CH.28.19	All 
1CH.28.20	And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do 
1CH.28.21	And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, 
1CH.29.2	Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for 
1CH.29.3	Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, 
1CH.29.4	 three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses 
1CH.29.5	the gold for 
1CH.29.6	Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly, 
1CH.29.7	and gave, for the service of the house of God, of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. 
1CH.29.8	And they with whom 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the 
1CH.29.10	Wherefore David blessed the 
1CH.29.11	 Thine, O 
1CH.29.12	Both riches and honor 
1CH.29.13	Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
1CH.29.14	But who 
1CH.29.15	For we 
1CH.29.16	O 
1CH.29.17	I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee. 
1CH.29.18	O 
1CH.29.19	and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all 
1CH.29.20	And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the 
1CH.29.21	And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the 
1CH.29.22	and did eat and drink before the 
1CH.29.22	And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed 
1CH.29.23	 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the 
1CH.29.24	And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. 
1CH.29.25	And the 
1CH.29.26	Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	 And the time that he reigned over Israel 
1CH.29.28	And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 
1CH.29.29	Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they 
1CH.29.30	with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
2CH.1.1	And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the 
2CH.1.2	Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers. 
2CH.1.3	So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that 
2CH.1.4	 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kir´jath–je´arim to 
2CH.1.5	 Moreover the brazen altar, that Bez´aleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the 
2CH.1.6	And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the 
2CH.1.7	In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee. 
2CH.1.8	And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead. 
2CH.1.9	 Now, O 
2CH.1.10	Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, 
2CH.1.11	And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: 
2CH.1.12	wisdom and knowledge 
2CH.1.13	Then Solomon came 
2CH.1.15	 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem 
2CH.1.16	 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
2CH.1.17	And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred 
2CH.2.1	And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the 
2CH.2.2	And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them. 
2CH.2.3	And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, 
2CH.2.4	Behold, I build a house to the name of the 
2CH.2.5	And the house which I build 
2CH.2.6	 But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who 
2CH.2.7	Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that 
2CH.2.8	Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants 
2CH.2.9	even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build 
2CH.2.10	And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
2CH.2.11	Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the 
2CH.2.12	Huram said moreover, Blessed 
2CH.2.13	And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's, 
2CH.2.14	the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father 
2CH.2.15	Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: 
2CH.2.16	and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
2CH.2.17	And Solomon numbered all the strangers that 
2CH.2.18	And he set threescore and ten thousand of them 
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the house of the 
2CH.3.2	And he began to build in the second 
2CH.3.3	Now these 
2CH.3.4	And the porch that 
2CH.3.5	And the greater house he ceiled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains. 
2CH.3.6	And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold 
2CH.3.7	He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.
2CH.3.9	And the weight of the nails 
2CH.3.11	And the wings of the cherubim 
2CH.3.12	And 
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces 
2CH.3.14	 And he made the veil 
2CH.3.15	Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that 
2CH.3.16	And he made chains, 
2CH.3.17	And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin,
2CH.4.2	Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. 
2CH.4.3	And under it 
2CH.4.4	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea 
2CH.4.5	And the thickness of it 
2CH.4.6	 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea 
2CH.4.8	 He made also ten tables, and placed 
2CH.4.9	Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass. 
2CH.4.10	And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.
2CH.4.11	And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God; 
2CH.4.12	, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters 
2CH.4.13	and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which 
2CH.4.14	He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; 
2CH.4.15	one sea, and twelve oxen under it. 
2CH.4.16	The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the 
2CH.4.17	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zere´dathah. 
2CH.4.18	Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
2CH.4.19	And Solomon made all the vessels that 
2CH.4.20	moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; 
2CH.4.21	and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, 
2CH.4.22	and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, 
2CH.5.3	Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which 
2CH.5.4	And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark. 
2CH.5.5	And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that 
2CH.5.6	Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 
2CH.5.7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.8	for the cherubim spread forth 
2CH.5.9	And they drew out the staves 
2CH.5.11	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy 
2CH.5.12	also the Levites 
2CH.5.13	 it came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers 
2CH.5.14	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the 
2CH.6.1	Then said Solomon, The 
2CH.6.2	But I have built a house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever. 
2CH.6.3	And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood. 
2CH.6.4	 And he said, Blessed 
2CH.6.5	Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel: 
2CH.6.6	but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel. 
2CH.6.7	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the 
2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. 
2CH.6.10	The 
2CH.6.11	And in it have I put the ark, wherein 
2CH.6.12	And he stood before the altar of the 
2CH.6.13	for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven, 
2CH.6.14	and said, O 
2CH.6.15	thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled 
2CH.6.16	 Now therefore, O 
2CH.6.17	Now then, O 
2CH.6.19	Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O 
2CH.6.20	 that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place. 
2CH.6.21	Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, 
2CH.6.22	If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house; 
2CH.6.23	then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
2CH.6.24	And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house; 
2CH.6.25	then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
2CH.6.26	When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; 
2CH.6.27	then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.
2CH.6.28	If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locusts or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore, or whatsoever sickness 
2CH.6.29	 what prayer 
2CH.6.30	then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men;) 
2CH.6.31	that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
2CH.6.32	Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house; 
2CH.6.33	then hear thou from the heavens, 
2CH.6.34	If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name; 
2CH.6.35	then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
2CH.6.36	If they sin against thee, (for 
2CH.6.37	yet 
2CH.6.38	if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and 
2CH.6.39	then hear thou from the heavens, 
2CH.6.40	Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and 
2CH.6.41	 Now therefore arise, O 
2CH.6.42	O 
2CH.7.2	And the priests could not enter into the house of the 
2CH.7.3	 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the 
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the 
2CH.7.5	And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 
2CH.7.6	And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of music of the 
2CH.7.7	Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that 
2CH.7.8	Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt. 
2CH.7.9	And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. 
2CH.7.10	And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the 
2CH.7.11	Thus Solomon finished the house of the 
2CH.7.12	And the 
2CH.7.13	If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; 
2CH.7.14	if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. 
2CH.7.15	Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer 
2CH.7.16	For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. 
2CH.7.17	And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments; 
2CH.7.18	 then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man 
2CH.7.19	But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; 
2CH.7.20	then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it 
2CH.7.21	And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the 
2CH.7.22	And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the 
2CH.8.1	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the 
2CH.8.2	that the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
2CH.8.3	And Solomon went to Ha´math–zo´bah, and prevailed against it. 
2CH.8.4	And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	Also he built Beth–ho´ron the upper, and Beth–ho´ron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 
2CH.8.6	and Ba´alath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion. 
2CH.8.7	 all the people 
2CH.8.8	 of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day. 
2CH.8.9	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they 
2CH.8.10	And these 
2CH.8.11	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because 
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the 
2CH.8.13	 even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, 
2CH.8.14	And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded. 
2CH.8.15	And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
2CH.8.16	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the 
2CH.8.17	Then went Solomon to E´zi-on–ge´ber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	And Huram sent him, by the hands of his servants, ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought 
2CH.9.2	And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not. 
2CH.9.3	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, 
2CH.9.4	and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the 
2CH.9.5	And she said to the king, 
2CH.9.6	howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen 
2CH.9.7	Happy 
2CH.9.8	Blessed be the 
2CH.9.9	And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.
2CH.9.10	And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones. 
2CH.9.11	And the king made 
2CH.9.12	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides 
2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 
2CH.9.14	besides 
2CH.9.15	And king Solomon made two hundred targets 
2CH.9.16	And three hundred shields 
2CH.9.17	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	And 
2CH.9.19	and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom. 
2CH.9.20	And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon 
2CH.9.21	For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
2CH.9.22	And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart. 
2CH.9.24	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 
2CH.9.25	 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
2CH.9.26	 And he reigned over all the kings from the river
2CH.9.27	 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that 
2CH.9.28	 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, 
2CH.9.30	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
2CH.9.31	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehobo´am his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.10.1	And Rehobo´am went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	And it came to pass, when Jerobo´am the son of Nebat, who 
2CH.10.3	And they sent and called him. So Jerobo´am and all Israel came and spake to Rehobo´am, saying, 
2CH.10.4	Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee. 
2CH.10.5	And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
2CH.10.6	And king Rehobo´am took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye 
2CH.10.7	And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever. 
2CH.10.8	But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him. 
2CH.10.9	And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us? 
2CH.10.10	And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou 
2CH.10.11	For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.12	So Jerobo´am and all the people came to Rehobo´am on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day. 
2CH.10.13	And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehobo´am forsook the counsel of the old men, 
2CH.10.14	and answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.15	So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the 
2CH.10.17	But 
2CH.10.18	Then king Rehobo´am sent Hador´am that 
2CH.10.19	And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
2CH.11.1	And when Rehobo´am was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen 
2CH.11.2	But the word of the 
2CH.11.3	Speak unto Rehobo´am the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 
2CH.11.4	Thus saith the 
2CH.11.5	And Rehobo´am dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah. 
2CH.11.6	He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Teko´a, 
2CH.11.7	and Beth–zur, and Shoco, and Adul´lam, 
2CH.11.8	and Gath, and Mare´shah, and Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	and Adora´im, and Lachish, and Aze´kah, 
2CH.11.10	and Zorah, and Aj´alon, and Hebron, which 
2CH.11.11	And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and store of victuals, and of oil and wine. 
2CH.11.12	And in every several city 
2CH.11.13	And the priests and the Levites that 
2CH.11.14	For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jerobo´am and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the 
2CH.11.15	 and he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made. 
2CH.11.16	And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek the 
2CH.11.17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehobo´am the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
2CH.11.18	And Rehobo´am took him Ma´halath the daughter of Jer´imoth the son of David to wife, 
2CH.11.19	which bare him children; Je´ush, and Shemari´ah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	And after her he took Ma´achah the daughter of Ab´salom; which bare him Abi´jah, and At´tai, and Ziza, and Shelo´mith. 
2CH.11.21	And Rehobo´am loved Ma´achah the daughter of Ab´salom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.) 
2CH.11.22	And Rehobo´am made Abi´jah the son of Ma´achah the chief, 
2CH.11.23	And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he desired many wives.
2CH.12.1	And it came to pass, when Rehobo´am had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the 
2CH.12.2	And it came to pass, 
2CH.12.3	with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people 
2CH.12.4	And he took the fenced cities which 
2CH.12.5	Then came Shemai´ah the prophet to Rehobo´am, and 
2CH.12.6	Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The 
2CH.12.7	And when the 
2CH.12.8	Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
2CH.12.10	Instead of which king Rehobo´am made shields of brass, and committed 
2CH.12.11	And when the king entered into the house of the 
2CH.12.12	And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the 
2CH.12.13	So king Rehobo´am strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehobo´am 
2CH.12.14	And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the 
2CH.12.15	Now the acts of Rehobo´am, first and last, 
2CH.12.16	And Rehobo´am slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abi´jah his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.13.1	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jerobo´am began Abi´jah to reign over Judah. 
2CH.13.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also 
2CH.13.2	And there was war between Abi´jah and Jerobo´am. 
2CH.13.3	And Abi´jah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, 
2CH.13.4	And Abi´jah stood up upon mount Zemara´im, which 
2CH.13.5	ought ye not to know that the 
2CH.13.6	Yet Jerobo´am the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord. 
2CH.13.7	And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Be´li-al, and have strengthened themselves against Rehobo´am the son of Solomon, when Rehobo´am was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.
2CH.13.8	And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the 
2CH.13.9	Have ye not cast out the priests of the 
2CH.13.10	But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	and they burn unto the 
2CH.13.12	And, behold, God himself 
2CH.13.13	But Jerobo´am caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment 
2CH.13.14	And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle 
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jerobo´am and all Israel before Abi´jah and Judah. 
2CH.13.16	And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand. 
2CH.13.17	And Abi´jah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. 
2CH.13.18	Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the 
2CH.13.19	And Abi´jah pursued after Jerobo´am, and took cities from him, Beth–el with the towns thereof, and Jesha´nah with the towns thereof, and E´phra-in with the towns thereof. 
2CH.13.20	Neither did Jerobo´am recover strength again in the days of Abi´jah: and the 
2CH.13.21	But Abi´jah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	And the rest of the acts of Abi´jah, and his ways, and his sayings, 
2CH.14.1	So Abi´jah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. 
2CH.14.2	And Asa did 
2CH.14.3	for he took away the altars of the strange 
2CH.14.4	and commanded Judah to seek the 
2CH.14.5	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. 
2CH.14.6	And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the 
2CH.14.7	Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about 
2CH.14.8	And Asa had an army 
2CH.14.9	And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with a host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mare´shah. 
2CH.14.10	Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zeph´a-thah at Mare´shah. 
2CH.14.11	And Asa cried unto the 
2CH.14.12	So the 
2CH.14.13	And Asa and the people that 
2CH.14.14	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the 
2CH.14.15	They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	And the Spirit of God came upon Azari´ah the son of Oded: 
2CH.15.2	and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The 
2CH.15.3	Now for a long season Israel 
2CH.15.4	But when they in their trouble did turn unto the 
2CH.15.5	And in those times 
2CH.15.6	And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity. 
2CH.15.7	Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.
2CH.15.8	And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount E´phra-im, and renewed the altar of the 
2CH.15.9	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of E´phra-im and Manas´seh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the 
2CH.15.10	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
2CH.15.11	And they offered unto the 
2CH.15.12	And they entered into a covenant to seek the 
2CH.15.13	that whosoever would not seek the 
2CH.15.14	And they sware unto the 
2CH.15.15	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the 
2CH.15.16	And also 
2CH.15.17	But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 
2CH.15.18	And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels. 
2CH.15.19	And there was no 
2CH.16.1	In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Ba´asha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
2CH.16.2	Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.16.3	 a league between me and thee, as 
2CH.16.4	And Ben–ha´dad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and A´bel–ma´im, and all the store cities of Naph´tali. 
2CH.16.5	And it came to pass, when Ba´asha heard 
2CH.16.6	Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Ba´asha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	And at that time Hana´ni the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the 
2CH.16.8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the 
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the 
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for 
2CH.16.11	And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they 
2CH.16.12	And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease 
2CH.16.13	And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds 
2CH.17.1	And Jehosh´aphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of E´phra-im, which Asa his father had taken. 
2CH.17.3	And the 
2CH.17.4	but sought to the 
2CH.17.5	Therefore the 
2CH.17.6	And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the 
2CH.17.7	Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, 
2CH.17.8	And with them 
2CH.17.9	And they taught in Judah, and 
2CH.17.10	And the fear of the 
2CH.17.11	Also 
2CH.17.12	And Jehosh´aphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store. 
2CH.17.13	And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valor, 
2CH.17.14	And these 
2CH.17.15	And next to him 
2CH.17.16	And next him 
2CH.17.17	And of Benjamin; Eli´ada a mighty man of valor, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand. 
2CH.17.18	And next him 
2CH.17.19	These waited on the king, besides 
2CH.18.1	Now Jehosh´aphat had riches and honor in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab. 
2CH.18.2	And after 
2CH.18.3	And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehosh´aphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ra´moth–gil´e-ad? And he answered him, I 
2CH.18.4	And Jehosh´aphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the 
2CH.18.5	Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ra´moth–gil´e-ad to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver 
2CH.18.6	But Jehosh´aphat said, 
2CH.18.7	And the king of Israel said unto Jehosh´aphat, 
2CH.18.8	And the king of Israel called for one 
2CH.18.9	And the king of Israel and Jehosh´aphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in 
2CH.18.10	And Zedeki´ah the son of Chena´anah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the 
2CH.18.11	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ra´moth–gil´e-ad, and prosper: for the 
2CH.18.12	And the messenger that went to call Micai´ah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets 
2CH.18.13	And Micai´ah said, 
2CH.18.14	And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micai´ah, shall we go to Ra´moth–gil´e-ad to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand. 
2CH.18.15	And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the 
2CH.18.16	 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the 
2CH.18.17	And the king of Israel said to Jehosh´aphat, Did I not tell thee 
2CH.18.18	Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the 
2CH.18.19	And the 
2CH.18.20	Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the 
2CH.18.21	And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And 
2CH.18.22	Now therefore, behold, the 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedeki´ah the son of Chena´anah came near, and smote Micai´ah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the 
2CH.18.24	And Micai´ah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. 
2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micai´ah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Jo´ash the king's son; 
2CH.18.26	and say, Thus saith the king, Put this 
2CH.18.27	And Micai´ah said, If thou certainly return in peace, 
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehosh´aphat the king of Judah went up to Ra´moth–gil´e-ad. 
2CH.18.29	And the king of Israel said unto Jehosh´aphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle. 
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that 
2CH.18.31	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehosh´aphat, that they said, It 
2CH.18.32	For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him. 
2CH.18.33	And a 
2CH.18.34	And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed 
2CH.19.1	And Jehosh´aphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	And Jehu the son of Hana´ni the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehosh´aphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the 
2CH.19.3	Nevertheless, there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.
2CH.19.4	And Jehosh´aphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer–sheba to mount E´phra-im, and brought them back unto the 
2CH.19.5	And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city, 
2CH.19.6	and said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the 
2CH.19.7	Wherefore now let the fear of the 
2CH.19.8	Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehosh´aphat set of the Levites, and 
2CH.19.9	And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the 
2CH.19.10	And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the 
2CH.19.11	And, behold, Amari´ah the chief priest 
2CH.20.1	It came to pass after this also, 
2CH.20.2	Then there came some that told Jehosh´aphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they 
2CH.20.3	And Jehosh´aphat feared, and set himself to seek the 
2CH.20.4	And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask 
2CH.20.5	And Jehosh´aphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the 
2CH.20.6	and said, O 
2CH.20.8	And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying, 
2CH.20.9	If, 
2CH.20.10	 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Se´ir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not; 
2CH.20.11	behold, 
2CH.20.12	O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes 
2CH.20.13	And all Judah stood before the 
2CH.20.14	Then upon Jaha´zi-el the son of Zechari´ah, the son of Benai´ah, the son of Je-i´el, the son of Mattani´ah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the 
2CH.20.15	 and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehosh´aphat, Thus saith the 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeru´el. 
2CH.20.17	Ye shall not 
2CH.20.18	And Jehosh´aphat bowed his head with 
2CH.20.19	And the Levites, of the children of the Ko´hathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the 
2CH.20.20	And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Teko´a: and as they went forth, Jehosh´aphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the 
2CH.20.21	And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the 
2CH.20.22	And when they began to sing and to praise, the 
2CH.20.23	For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Se´ir, utterly to slay and destroy 
2CH.20.24	And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they 
2CH.20.25	And when Jehosh´aphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. 
2CH.20.26	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Bera´chah; for there they blessed the 
2CH.20.27	Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehosh´aphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the 
2CH.20.28	And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the 
2CH.20.29	And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of 
2CH.20.30	So the realm of Jehosh´aphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.
2CH.20.31	And Jehosh´aphat reigned over Judah: 
2CH.20.32	And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing 
2CH.20.33	Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehosh´aphat, first and last, behold, they 
2CH.20.35	And after this did Jehosh´aphat king of Judah join himself with Ahazi´ah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: 
2CH.20.36	and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in E´zi-on–ge´ber. 
2CH.20.37	Then Eli-e´zer the son of Do´davah of Mare´shah prophesied against Jehosh´aphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahazi´ah, the 
2CH.21.1	Now Jehosh´aphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jeho´ram his son reigned in his stead. 
2CH.21.2	And he had brethren the sons of Jehosh´aphat, Azari´ah, and Jehi´el, and Zechari´ah, and Azari´ah, and Michael, and Shephati´ah: all these 
2CH.21.3	And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jeho´ram; because he 
2CH.21.4	Now when Jeho´ram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and 
2CH.21.5	Jeho´ram 
2CH.21.6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought 
2CH.21.7	 Howbeit the 
2CH.21.9	Then Jeho´ram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots. 
2CH.21.10	So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time 
2CH.21.11	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah 
2CH.21.12	And there came a writing to him from Eli´jah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the 
2CH.21.13	but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, 
2CH.21.14	behold, with a great plague will the 
2CH.21.15	and thou 
2CH.21.16	Moreover the 
2CH.21.17	and they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jeho´ahaz, the youngest of his sons.
2CH.21.18	And after all this the 
2CH.21.19	And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. 
2CH.21.20	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
2CH.22.1	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahazi´ah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahazi´ah the son of Jeho´ram king of Judah reigned. 
2CH.22.2	Forty
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly. 
2CH.22.4	Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the 
2CH.22.5	He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jeho´ram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Haz´a-el king of Syria at Ra´moth–gil´e-ad: and the Syrians smote Joram. 
2CH.22.6	And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Haz´a-el king of Syria. And Azari´ah the son of Jeho´ram king of Judah went down to see Jeho´ram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
2CH.22.7	And the destruction of Ahazi´ah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jeho´ram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the 
2CH.22.8	And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahazi´ah, that ministered to Ahazi´ah, he slew them. 
2CH.22.9	And he sought Ahazi´ah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he 
2CH.22.10	But when Athali´ah the mother of Ahazi´ah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. 
2CH.22.11	But Jehosh´abeath, the daughter of the king, took Jo´ash the son of Ahazi´ah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehosh´abeath, the daughter of king Jeho´ram, the wife of Jehoi´ada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahazi´ah,) hid him from Athali´ah, so that she slew him not. 
2CH.22.12	And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athali´ah reigned over the land.
2CH.23.1	And in the seventh year Jehoi´ada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azari´ah the son of Jero´ham, and Ish´ma-el the son of Jeho´hanan, and Azari´ah the son of Obed, and Ma-asei´ah the son of Adai´ah, and Elish´aphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him. 
2CH.23.2	And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.23.3	 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the 
2CH.23.4	This 
2CH.23.5	and a third part 
2CH.23.6	But let none come into the house of the 
2CH.23.7	And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever 
2CH.23.8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoi´ada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go 
2CH.23.9	Moreover Jehoi´ada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that 
2CH.23.10	And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about. 
2CH.23.11	Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and 
2CH.23.12	Now when Athali´ah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the 
2CH.23.13	and she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athali´ah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, treason. 
2CH.23.14	Then Jehoi´ada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the 
2CH.23.15	So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
2CH.23.16	And Jehoi´ada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the 
2CH.23.17	Then all the people went to the house of Ba´al, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Ba´al before the altars. 
2CH.23.18	Also Jehoi´ada appointed the offices of the house of the 
2CH.23.19	And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the 
2CH.23.20	And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the 
2CH.23.21	And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athali´ah with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Jo´ash 
2CH.24.2	And Jo´ash did 
2CH.24.3	And Jehoi´ada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	And it came to pass after this, 
2CH.24.5	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened 
2CH.24.6	 And the king called for Jehoi´ada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of Athali´ah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the 
2CH.24.8	And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the 
2CH.24.9	And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the 
2CH.24.10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. 
2CH.24.11	Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that 
2CH.24.12	And the king and Jehoi´ada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the 
2CH.24.13	So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it. 
2CH.24.14	And when they had finished 
2CH.24.15	But Jehoi´ada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; a hundred and thirty years old 
2CH.24.16	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Jehoi´ada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them. 
2CH.24.18	And they left the house of the 
2CH.24.19	Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the 
2CH.24.21	And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the 
2CH.24.22	Thus Jo´ash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoi´ada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The 
2CH.24.23	And it came to pass at the end of the year, 
2CH.24.24	For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the 
2CH.24.25	And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoi´ada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings. 
2CH.24.26	And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shim´e-ath an Ammonitess, and Jehoz´abad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess. 
2CH.24.27	Now 
2CH.25.1	Amazi´ah 
2CH.25.2	And he did 
2CH.25.3	Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father. 
2CH.25.4	 But he slew not their children, but 
2CH.25.5	Moreover Amazi´ah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of 
2CH.25.6	He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver. 
2CH.25.7	But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the 
2CH.25.8	But if thou wilt go, do 
2CH.25.9	And Amazi´ah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The 
2CH.25.10	Then Amazi´ah separated them, 
2CH.25.11	And Amazi´ah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Se´ir ten thousand. 
2CH.25.12	And 
2CH.25.13	But the soldiers of the army which Amazi´ah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth–ho´ron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
2CH.25.14	Now it came to pass, after that Amazi´ah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Se´ir, and set them up 
2CH.25.15	Wherefore the anger of the 
2CH.25.16	And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that 
2CH.25.17	Then Amazi´ah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Jo´ash, the son of Jeho´ahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face. 
2CH.25.18	And Jo´ash king of Israel sent to Amazi´ah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that 
2CH.25.19	Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to 
2CH.25.20	But Amazi´ah would not hear; for it 
2CH.25.21	So Jo´ash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, 
2CH.25.22	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent. 
2CH.25.23	And Jo´ash the king of Israel took Amazi´ah king of Judah, the son of Jo´ash, the son of Jeho´ahaz, at Beth–she´mesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of E´phra-im to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
2CH.25.24	And 
2CH.25.25	And Amazi´ah the son of Jo´ash king of Judah lived after the death of Jo´ash son of Jeho´ahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the acts of Amazi´ah, first and last, behold, 
2CH.25.27	Now after the time that Amazi´ah did turn away from following the 
2CH.25.28	And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
2CH.26.1	Then all the people of Judah took Uzzi´ah, who 
2CH.26.2	He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. 
2CH.26.3	Sixteen years old 
2CH.26.4	And he did 
2CH.26.5	And he sought God in the days of Zechari´ah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the 
2CH.26.6	And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines. 
2CH.26.7	And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur–ba´al, and the Me´hunim. 
2CH.26.8	And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzzi´ah: and his name spread abroad 
2CH.26.9	Moreover Uzzi´ah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning 
2CH.26.10	Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains; husbandmen 
2CH.26.11	Moreover Uzzi´ah had a host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Je-i´el the scribe and Ma-asei´ah the ruler, under the hand of Hanani´ah, 
2CH.26.12	The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valor 
2CH.26.13	And under their hand 
2CH.26.14	And Uzzi´ah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings 
2CH.26.15	And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.
2CH.26.16	But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to 
2CH.26.17	And Azari´ah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the 
2CH.26.18	 and they withstood Uzzi´ah the king, and said unto him, 
2CH.26.19	Then Uzzi´ah was wroth, and 
2CH.26.20	And Azari´ah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he 
2CH.26.21	And Uzzi´ah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, 
2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzzi´ah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write. 
2CH.26.23	 So Uzzi´ah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which 
2CH.27.1	Jotham 
2CH.27.2	And he did 
2CH.27.3	He built the high gate of the house of the 
2CH.27.4	Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers. 
2CH.27.5	He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third. 
2CH.27.6	So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the 
2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they 
2CH.27.8	He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz 
2CH.28.2	for he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Ba´alim. 
2CH.28.3	Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the 
2CH.28.4	He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2CH.28.6	For Pekah the son of Remali´ah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, 
2CH.28.7	And Zichri, a mighty man of E´phra-im, slew Ma-asei´ah the king's son, and Az´rikam the governor of the house, and Elka´nah 
2CH.28.8	And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. 
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: 
2CH.28.11	Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the 
2CH.28.12	Then certain of the heads of the children of E´phra-im, Azari´ah the son of Jo´hanan, Berechi´ah the son of Meshil´lemoth, and Jehizki´ah the son of Shallum, and Ama´sa the son of Had´lai, stood up against them that came from the war, 
2CH.28.13	and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the 
2CH.28.14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. 
2CH.28.15	And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him. 
2CH.28.17	For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives. 
2CH.28.18	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth–she´mesh, and Aj´alon, and Ged´eroth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there. 
2CH.28.19	For the 
2CH.28.20	And Til´gath–pilne´ser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not. 
2CH.28.21	For Ahaz took away a portion 
2CH.28.22	And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the 
2CH.28.23	For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, 
2CH.28.24	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the 
2CH.28.25	And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the 
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they 
2CH.28.27	 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, 
2CH.29.1	Hezeki´ah began to reign 
2CH.29.2	And he did 
2CH.29.3	He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the 
2CH.29.4	And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street, 
2CH.29.5	and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the 
2CH.29.6	For our fathers have trespassed, and done 
2CH.29.7	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy 
2CH.29.8	Wherefore the wrath of the 
2CH.29.9	For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives 
2CH.29.10	Now 
2CH.29.11	My sons, be not now negligent: for the 
2CH.29.12	Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Ama´sai, and Joel the son of Azari´ah, of the sons of the Ko´hathites: and of the sons of Mera´ri; Kish the son of Abdi, and Azari´ah the son of Jehal´elel: and of the Ger´shonites; Jo´ah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Jo´ah: 
2CH.29.13	and of the sons of Eliza´phan; Shimri, and Je-i´el: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechari´ah, and Mattani´ah: 
2CH.29.14	and of the sons of Heman; Jehi´el, and Shim´e-i: and of the sons of Jedu´thun; Shemai´ah, and Uz´zi-el. 
2CH.29.15	And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the 
2CH.29.16	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the 
2CH.29.17	Now they began on the first 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to Hezeki´ah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the 
2CH.29.19	Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they 
2CH.29.20	Then Hezeki´ah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the 
2CH.29.21	And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer 
2CH.29.22	So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled 
2CH.29.23	And they brought forth the he goats 
2CH.29.24	and the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded 
2CH.29.25	And he set the Levites in the house of the 
2CH.29.26	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. 
2CH.29.27	And Hezeki´ah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the 
2CH.29.28	And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: 
2CH.29.29	And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped. 
2CH.29.30	Moreover Hezeki´ah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezeki´ah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the 
2CH.29.32	And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, 
2CH.29.33	And the consecrated things 
2CH.29.34	But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the 
2CH.29.35	And also the burnt offerings 
2CH.29.36	And Hezeki´ah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was 
2CH.30.1	And Hezeki´ah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to E´phra-im and Manas´seh, that they should come to the house of the 
2CH.30.2	 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month. 
2CH.30.3	For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.4	And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation. 
2CH.30.5	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer–sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the 
2CH.30.6	So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the 
2CH.30.7	And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the 
2CH.30.8	Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers 
2CH.30.9	For if ye turn again unto the 
2CH.30.10	So the posts passed from city to city, through the country of E´phra-im and Manas´seh, even unto Zeb´ulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. 
2CH.30.11	Nevertheless, divers of Asher and Manas´seh and of Zeb´ulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the 
2CH.30.13	And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. 
2CH.30.14	And they arose and took away the altars that 
2CH.30.15	Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth 
2CH.30.16	And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, 
2CH.30.17	For 
2CH.30.18	For a multitude of the people, 
2CH.30.19	 prepareth his heart to seek God, the 
2CH.30.20	And the 
2CH.30.21	And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the 
2CH.30.22	And Hezeki´ah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the 
2CH.30.23	And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept 
2CH.30.24	For Hezeki´ah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. 
2CH.30.25	And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. 
2CH.30.26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel 
2CH.30.27	Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came 
2CH.31.1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in E´phra-im also and Manas´seh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
2CH.31.2	And Hezeki´ah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the 
2CH.31.4	 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the 
2CH.31.5	And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all 
2CH.31.6	And 
2CH.31.7	In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished 
2CH.31.8	And when Hezeki´ah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the 
2CH.31.9	Then Hezeki´ah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 
2CH.31.10	And Azari´ah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since 
2CH.31.11	Then Hezeki´ah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the 
2CH.31.12	and brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated 
2CH.31.13	And Jehi´el, and Azazi´ah, and Nahath, and As´ahel, and Jer´imoth, and Joz´abad, and El´i-el, and Ismachi´ah, and Mahath, and Benai´ah, 
2CH.31.14	And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, 
2CH.31.15	And next him 
2CH.31.16	besides their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, 
2CH.31.17	both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses; 
2CH.31.18	and to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness: 
2CH.31.19	also of the sons of Aaron the priests, 
2CH.31.20	And thus did Hezeki´ah throughout all Judah, and wrought 
2CH.31.21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did 
2CH.32.1	After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennach´erib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself. 
2CH.32.2	And when Hezeki´ah saw that Sennach´erib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which 
2CH.32.4	So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water? 
2CH.32.5	Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised 
2CH.32.6	And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, 
2CH.32.7	Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that 
2CH.32.8	With him 
2CH.32.9	After this did Sennach´erib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he 
2CH.32.10	Thus saith Sennach´erib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem? 
2CH.32.11	Doth not Hezeki´ah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The 
2CH.32.12	Hath not the same Hezeki´ah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it? 
2CH.32.13	Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of 
2CH.32.14	Who 
2CH.32.15	Now therefore let not Hezeki´ah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?
2CH.32.16	And his servants spake yet 
2CH.32.17	He wrote also letters to rail on the 
2CH.32.18	Then they cried with a loud voice, in the Jews' speech, unto the people of Jerusalem that 
2CH.32.19	And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, 
2CH.32.20	And for this 
2CH.32.21	And the 
2CH.32.22	Thus the 
2CH.32.23	And many brought gifts unto the 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezeki´ah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezeki´ah rendered not again according to the benefit 
2CH.32.26	Notwithstanding, Hezeki´ah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, 
2CH.32.27	And Hezeki´ah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; 
2CH.32.28	storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. 
2CH.32.29	Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much. 
2CH.32.30	This same Hezeki´ah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezeki´ah prospered in all his works. 
2CH.32.31	Howbeit, in 
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezeki´ah, and his goodness, behold, they 
2CH.32.33	And Hezeki´ah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manas´seh his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.33.1	Manas´seh 
2CH.33.2	 but did 
2CH.33.3	For he built again the high places which Hezeki´ah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Ba´alim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 
2CH.33.4	 Also he built altars in the house of the 
2CH.33.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the 
2CH.33.6	And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.7	 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 
2CH.33.8	neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. 
2CH.33.9	So Manas´seh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, 
2CH.33.10	And the 
2CH.33.11	Wherefore the 
2CH.33.12	And when he was in affliction, he besought the 
2CH.33.13	and prayed unto him: and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manas´seh knew that the 
2CH.33.14	Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah. 
2CH.33.15	And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the 
2CH.33.16	And he repaired the altar of the 
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of Manas´seh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the 
2CH.33.19	His prayer also, and 
2CH.33.20	So Manas´seh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.33.21	Amon 
2CH.33.22	But he did 
2CH.33.23	and humbled not himself before the 
2CH.33.24	And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house. 
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josi´ah his son king in his stead.
2CH.34.2	And he did 
2CH.34.3	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images. 
2CH.34.4	 And they brake down the altars of Ba´alim in his presence; and the images, that 
2CH.34.5	 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.6	And 
2CH.34.7	And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azali´ah, and Ma-asei´ah the governor of the city, and Jo´ah the son of Jo´ahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the 
2CH.34.9	And when they came to Hilki´ah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manas´seh and E´phra-im, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.10	And they put 
2CH.34.11	even to the artificers and builders gave they 
2CH.34.12	And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them 
2CH.34.13	Also 
2CH.34.14	And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the 
2CH.34.15	And Hilki´ah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the 
2CH.34.16	And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do 
2CH.34.17	And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the 
2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilki´ah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
2CH.34.19	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes. 
2CH.34.20	And the king commanded Hilki´ah, and Ahi´kam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asai´ah a servant of the king's, saying, 
2CH.34.21	Go, inquire of the 
2CH.34.22	And Hilki´ah, and 
2CH.34.23	And she answered them, Thus saith the 
2CH.34.24	Thus saith the 
2CH.34.25	because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched. 
2CH.34.26	And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the 
2CH.34.27	Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard 
2CH.34.28	Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	And the king went up into the house of the 
2CH.34.31	And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the 
2CH.34.32	And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand 
2CH.34.33	And Josi´ah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that 
2CH.35.1	Moreover, Josi´ah kept a passover unto the 
2CH.35.2	And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the 
2CH.35.3	and said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the 
2CH.35.4	 and prepare 
2CH.35.5	and stand in the holy 
2CH.35.6	So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that 
2CH.35.7	And Josi´ah gave to the people, of the flocks, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these 
2CH.35.8	And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilki´ah and Zechari´ah and Jehi´el, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred 
2CH.35.9	Conani´ah also, and Shemai´ah and Nethan´e-el, his brethren, and Hashabi´ah and Je-i´el and Joz´abad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand 
2CH.35.10	So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment. 
2CH.35.11	And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled 
2CH.35.12	And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the 
2CH.35.13	 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the 
2CH.35.14	And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron 
2CH.35.15	 And the singers the sons of Asaph 
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the 
2CH.35.17	 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 
2CH.35.18	And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josi´ah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josi´ah was this passover kept.
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josi´ah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Car´chemish by Euphra´tes: and Josi´ah went out against him. 
2CH.35.21	But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? 
2CH.35.22	Nevertheless Josi´ah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megid´do. 
2CH.35.23	And the archers shot at king Josi´ah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded. 
2CH.35.24	His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in 
2CH.35.25	And Jeremiah lamented for Josi´ah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josi´ah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they 
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Josi´ah, and his goodness, according to 
2CH.35.27	and his deeds, first and last, behold, they 
2CH.36.1	Then the people of the land took Jeho´ahaz the son of Josi´ah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.2	Jeho´ahaz 
2CH.36.3	And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
2CH.36.4	 And the king of Egypt made Eli´akim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoi´akim. And Necho took Jeho´ahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
2CH.36.6	 Against him came up Nebuchadnez´zar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnez´zar also carried of the vessels of the house of the 
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoi´akim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they 
2CH.36.9	Jehoi´achin 
2CH.36.10	 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnez´zar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the 
2CH.36.12	And he did 
2CH.36.13	 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnez´zar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the 
2CH.36.14	Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the 
2CH.36.15	And the 
2CH.36.16	but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the 
2CH.36.18	And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.36.19	 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. 
2CH.36.20	And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia: 
2CH.36.21	 to fulfil the word of the 
2CH.36.22	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the 
2CH.36.23	 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the 
EZR.1.3	Who 
EZR.1.4	And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill offering for the house of God that 
EZR.1.5	Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all 
EZR.1.6	And all they that 
EZR.1.7	Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the 
EZR.1.8	even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mith´redath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbaz´zar, the prince of Judah. 
EZR.1.9	And this 
EZR.1.10	thirty basins of gold, silver basins of a second 
EZR.1.11	All the vessels of gold and of silver 
EZR.2.1	Now these

EZR.2.61	And of the children of the priests: the children of Habai´ah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzil´lai; which took a wife of the daughters of Barzil´lai the Gil´e-adite, and was called after their name: 
EZR.2.62	these sought their register 
EZR.2.63	 And the Tirsha´tha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
EZR.2.64	The whole congregation together 
EZR.2.65	besides their servants and their maids, of whom 
EZR.2.66	Their horses 
EZR.2.67	their camels, four hundred thirty and five; 
EZR.2.68	And 
EZR.2.69	they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.
EZR.3.1	And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel 
EZR.3.2	 Then stood up Jesh´u-a the son of Joz´adak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerub´babel the son of She-al´ti-el, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as 
EZR.3.3	 And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear 
EZR.3.4	 They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as 
EZR.3.5	 and afterward 
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the 
EZR.3.7	They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
EZR.3.8	Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerub´babel the son of She-al´ti-el, and Jesh´u-a the son of Joz´adak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the 
EZR.3.9	Then stood Jesh´u-a 
EZR.3.11	 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the 
EZR.3.12	But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, 
EZR.3.13	so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
EZR.4.1	Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the 
EZR.4.2	 then they came to Zerub´babel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye 
EZR.4.3	But Zerub´babel, and Jesh´u-a, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the 
EZR.4.4	Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, 
EZR.4.5	and hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Dari´us king of Persia.
EZR.4.7	And in the days of Artaxerx´es wrote Bishlam, Mith´redath, Tab´eel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerx´es king of Persia; and the writing of the letter 
EZR.4.8	Rehum the chancellor and Shim´shai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerx´es the king in this sort: 
EZR.4.9	then 
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnap´per brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest 
EZR.4.11	This 
EZR.4.12	Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls 
EZR.4.13	Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up 
EZR.4.14	Now because we have maintenance from 
EZR.4.15	that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city 
EZR.4.16	We certify the king that, if this city be builded 
EZR.4.18	The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. 
EZR.4.19	And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and 
EZR.4.20	There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all 
EZR.4.21	Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until 
EZR.4.22	Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
EZR.4.23	Now when the copy of king Artaxerx´es' letter 
EZR.4.24	Then ceased the work of the house of God which 
EZR.5.2	 Then rose up Zerub´babel the son of She-al´ti-el, and Jesh´u-a the son of Joz´adak, and began to build the house of God which 
EZR.5.3	At the same time came to them Tat´nai, governor on this side the river, and She´thar–boz´nai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall? 
EZR.5.4	Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? 
EZR.5.5	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Dari´us: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this 
EZR.5.6	The copy of the letter that Tat´nai, governor on this side the river, and She´thar–boz´nai, and his companions the Aphar´sachites, which 
EZR.5.7	they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Dari´us the king, all peace. 
EZR.5.8	Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands. 
EZR.5.9	Then asked we those elders, 
EZR.5.10	We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that 
EZR.5.11	And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up. 
EZR.5.12	 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnez´zar the king of Babylon, the Chalde´an, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. 
EZR.5.13	 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, 
EZR.5.14	And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnez´zar took out of the temple that 
EZR.5.15	and said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that 
EZR.5.16	Then came the same Sheshbaz´zar, 
EZR.5.17	Now therefore, if 
EZR.6.1	Then Dari´us the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. 
EZR.6.2	And there was found at Ach´metha, in the palace that 
EZR.6.3	In the first year of Cyrus the king, 
EZR.6.4	 three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house: 
EZR.6.5	and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnez´zar took forth out of the temple which 
EZR.6.6	Now 
EZR.6.7	let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place. 
EZR.6.8	Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, 
EZR.6.9	And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which 
EZR.6.10	that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. 
EZR.6.11	Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. 
EZR.6.12	And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter 
EZR.6.13	Then Tat´nai, governor on this side the river, She´thar–boz´nai, and their companions, according to that which Dari´us the king had sent, so they did speedily. 
EZR.6.14	 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Hag´gai the prophet and Zechari´ah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished 
EZR.6.15	And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Dari´us the king.
EZR.6.16	And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy, 
EZR.6.17	and offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which 
EZR.6.20	For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them 
EZR.6.21	And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the 
EZR.6.22	and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the 
EZR.7.1	Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerx´es king of Persia, Ezra the son of Serai´ah, the son of Azari´ah, the son of Hilki´ah, 
EZR.7.2	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahi´tub, 
EZR.7.3	the son of Amari´ah, the son of Azari´ah, the son of Merai´oth, 
EZR.7.4	the son of Zerahi´ah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	the son of Abishu´a, the son of Phin´ehas, the son of Ele-a´zar, the son of Aaron the chief priest: 
EZR.7.6	this Ezra went up from Babylon; and he 
EZR.7.7	And there went up 
EZR.7.8	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which 
EZR.7.9	For upon the first 
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the 
EZR.7.11	Now this 
EZR.7.12	Artaxerx´es, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect 
EZR.7.13	I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and 
EZR.7.14	Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which 
EZR.7.15	and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation 
EZR.7.16	and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which 
EZR.7.17	that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which 
EZR.7.18	And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, 
EZR.7.20	And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow 
EZR.7.21	And I, 
EZR.7.22	unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing 
EZR.7.23	Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 
EZR.7.24	Also we certify you, that, touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Neth´inim, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.
EZR.7.25	And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that 
EZR.7.26	And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether 
EZR.7.27	Blessed 
EZR.7.28	and hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the 
EZR.8.1	These 
EZR.8.2	Of the sons of Phin´ehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ith´amar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush. 
EZR.8.3	Of the sons of Shechani´ah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechari´ah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty. 
EZR.8.4	Of the sons of Pahath–mo´ab; Eliho-e´nai the son of Zerahi´ah, and with him two hundred males. 
EZR.8.5	Of the sons of Shechani´ah; the son of Jaha´zi-el, and with him three hundred males. 
EZR.8.6	Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males. 
EZR.8.7	And of the sons of Elam; Jeshai´ah the son of Athali´ah, and with him seventy males. 
EZR.8.8	And of the sons of Shephati´ah; Zebadi´ah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males. 
EZR.8.9	Of the sons of Jo´ab; Obadi´ah the son of Jehi´el, and with him two hundred and eighteen males. 
EZR.8.10	And of the sons of Shelo´mith; the son of Josi-phi´ah, and with him a hundred and threescore males. 
EZR.8.11	And of the sons of Be´bai; Zechari´ah the son of Be´bai, and with him twenty and eight males. 
EZR.8.12	And of the sons of Azgad; Jo´hanan the son of Hak´katan, and with him a hundred and ten males. 
EZR.8.13	And of the last sons of Adoni´kam, whose names 
EZR.8.14	Of the sons also of Big´vai; U´thai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
EZR.8.15	And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Aha´va; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. 
EZR.8.16	Then sent I for Eli-e´zer, for A´ri-el, for Shemai´ah, and for Elna´than, and for Jarib, and for Elna´than, and for Nathan, and for Zechari´ah, and for Meshul´lam, chief men; also for Joi´arib, and for Elna´than, men of understanding. 
EZR.8.17	And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphi´a, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, 
EZR.8.18	And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebi´ah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; 
EZR.8.19	and Hashabi´ah, and with him Jeshai´ah of the sons of Mera´ri, his brethren and their sons, twenty; 
EZR.8.20	also of the Neth´inim, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Neth´inim: all of them were expressed by name.
EZR.8.21	Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Aha´va, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. 
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.
EZR.8.24	Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebi´ah, Hashabi´ah, and ten of their brethren with them, 
EZR.8.25	and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, 
EZR.8.26	I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents, 
EZR.8.27	also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. 
EZR.8.28	And I said unto them, Ye 
EZR.8.29	Watch ye, and keep 
EZR.8.30	So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring 
EZR.8.31	Then we departed from the river of Aha´va on the twelfth 
EZR.8.32	And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. 
EZR.8.33	Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Mer´emoth the son of Uri´ah the priest; and with him 
EZR.8.34	by number 
EZR.8.36	And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.
EZR.9.1	Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, 
EZR.9.2	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of 
EZR.9.3	And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonished. 
EZR.9.4	Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice. 
EZR.9.5	And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the 
EZR.9.6	and said,
EZR.9.6	O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over 
EZR.9.7	Since the days of our fathers 
EZR.9.8	And now for a little space grace hath been 
EZR.9.9	For we 
EZR.9.10	And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments, 
EZR.9.11	which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness. 
EZR.9.12	 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave 
EZR.9.13	And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities 
EZR.9.14	should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed 
EZR.9.15	O 
EZR.10.1	Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore. 
EZR.10.2	And Shechani´ah the son of Jehi´el, 
EZR.10.3	Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law. 
EZR.10.4	Arise; for 
EZR.10.5	Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jo´hanan the son of Eli´ashib: and 
EZR.10.7	And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; 
EZR.10.8	and that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
EZR.10.9	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It 
EZR.10.10	And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel. 
EZR.10.11	Now therefore make confession unto the 
EZR.10.12	Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do. 
EZR.10.13	But the people 
EZR.10.14	Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us. 
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan the son of As´ahel and Jahazi´ah the son of Tikvah were employed about this 
EZR.10.16	And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, 
EZR.10.17	And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.
EZR.10.18	And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: 
EZR.10.19	And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and 
EZR.10.20	And of the sons of Immer; Hana´ni, and Zebadi´ah. 
EZR.10.21	And of the sons of Harim; Ma-asei´ah, and Eli´jah, and Shemai´ah, and Jehi´el, and Uzzi´ah. 
EZR.10.22	And of the sons of Pashur; Eli-oe´nai, Ma-asei´ah, Ish´ma-el, Nethan´e-el, Joz´abad, and Ela´sah.
EZR.10.23	Also of the Levites; Joz´abad, and Shim´e-i, and Kelai´ah, (the same 
EZR.10.24	Of the singers also; Eli´ashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
EZR.10.25	Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Rami´ah, and Jezi´ah, and Malchi´ah, and Mi´amin, and Ele-a´zar, and Malchi´jah, and Benai´ah. 
EZR.10.26	And of the sons of Elam; Mattani´ah, Zechari´ah, and Jehi´el, and Abdi, and Jer´emoth, and Eli´ah. 
EZR.10.27	And of the sons of Zattu; Eli-oe´nai, Eli´ashib, Mattani´ah, and Jer´emoth, and Zabad, and Azi´za. 
EZR.10.28	Of the sons also of Be´bai; Jeho´hanan, Hanani´ah, Zab´bai, 
EZR.10.29	And of the sons of Bani; Meshul´lam, Malluch, and Adai´ah, Jashub, and She´al, and Ramoth. 
EZR.10.30	And of the sons of Pahath–mo´ab; Adna, and Chelal, Benai´ah, Ma-asei´ah, Mattani´ah, Bez´aleel, and Bin´nu-i, and Manas´seh.

EZR.10.44	All these had taken strange wives: and 
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemi´ah the son of Hachali´ah.
NEH.1.1	And it came to pass in the month Chis´leu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, 
NEH.1.2	that Hana´ni, one of my brethren, came, he and 
NEH.1.3	And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province 
NEH.1.4	And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned 
NEH.1.5	and said, I beseech thee, O 
NEH.1.6	let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned. 
NEH.1.7	We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. 
NEH.1.8	 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, 
NEH.1.9	 but 
NEH.1.10	Now these 
NEH.1.11	O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.
NEH.1.11	For I was the king's cupbearer.
NEH.2.1	And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerx´es the king, 
NEH.2.2	Wherefore the king said unto me, Why 
NEH.2.3	 and said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, 
NEH.2.4	Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. 
NEH.2.5	And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it. 
NEH.2.6	And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. 
NEH.2.7	Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah; 
NEH.2.8	and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which 
NEH.2.9	Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. 
NEH.2.10	When Sanbal´lat the Hor´onite, and Tobi´ah the servant, the Ammonite, heard 
NEH.2.11	So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. 
NEH.2.12	And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I 
NEH.2.13	And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. 
NEH.2.14	Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but 
NEH.2.15	Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and 
NEH.2.16	And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told 
NEH.2.17	Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we 
NEH.2.18	Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for 
NEH.2.19	But when Sanbal´lat the Hor´onite, and Tobi´ah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard 
NEH.2.20	Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.
NEH.3.1	Then Eli´ashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Me´ah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Han´aneel. 
NEH.3.2	And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.
NEH.3.3	But the fish gate did the sons of Hassena´ah build, who 
NEH.3.4	And next unto them repaired Mer´emoth the son of Uri´jah, the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshul´lam the son of Berechi´ah, the son of Meshez´abeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Ba´ana. 
NEH.3.5	And next unto them the Teko´ites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord.
NEH.3.6	Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoi´ada the son of Pase´ah, and Meshul´lam the son of Besodei´ah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. 
NEH.3.7	And next unto them repaired Melati´ah the Gib´e-onite, and Jadon the Meron´othite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river. 
NEH.3.8	Next unto him repaired Uz´zi-el the son of Harhai´ah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hanani´ah the son of 
NEH.3.9	And next unto them repaired Rephai´ah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem. 
NEH.3.10	And next unto them repaired Jedai´ah the son of Haru´maph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabni´ah. 
NEH.3.11	Malchi´jah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahath–mo´ab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces. 
NEH.3.12	And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallo´hesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.
NEH.3.13	The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zano´ah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate.
NEH.3.14	But the dung gate repaired Malchi´ah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Beth–hac´cerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
NEH.3.15	But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Col–ho´zeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Silo´ah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David. 
NEH.3.16	After him repaired Nehemi´ah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Beth–zur, unto 
NEH.3.17	After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabi´ah, the ruler of the half part of Kei´lah, in his part. 
NEH.3.18	After him repaired their brethren, Ba´vai the son of Hen´adad, the ruler of the half part of Kei´lah. 
NEH.3.19	And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jesh´u-a, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armory at the turning 
NEH.3.20	After him Baruch the son of Zab´bai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning 
NEH.3.21	After him repaired Mer´emoth the son of Uri´jah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eli´ashib even to the end of the house of Eli´ashib. 
NEH.3.22	And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain. 
NEH.3.23	After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house. After him repaired Azari´ah the son of Ma-asei´ah the son of Anani´ah by his house. 
NEH.3.24	After him repaired Bin´nu-i the son of Hen´adad another piece, from the house of Azari´ah unto the turning 
NEH.3.25	Palal the son of U´zai, over against the turning 
NEH.3.26	Moreover the Neth´inim dwelt in Ophel, unto 
NEH.3.27	After them the Teko´ites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.
NEH.3.28	From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house. 
NEH.3.29	After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemai´ah the son of Shechani´ah, the keeper of the east gate. 
NEH.3.30	After him repaired Hanani´ah the son of Shelemi´ah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshul´lam the son of Berechi´ah over against his chamber. 
NEH.3.31	After him repaired Malchi´ah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the Neth´inim, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner. 
NEH.3.32	And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
NEH.4.1	But it came to pass, that when Sanbal´lat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. 
NEH.4.2	And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned? 
NEH.4.3	Now Tobi´ah the Ammonite 
NEH.4.4	Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: 
NEH.4.5	and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked 
NEH.4.6	So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
NEH.4.7	But it came to pass, 
NEH.4.8	and conspired all of them together to come 
NEH.4.9	Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
NEH.4.10	And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and 
NEH.4.11	And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease. 
NEH.4.12	And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us 
NEH.4.13	Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, 
NEH.4.14	And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, 
NEH.4.15	And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work. 
NEH.4.16	And it came to pass from that time forth, 
NEH.4.17	They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, 
NEH.4.18	For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and 
NEH.4.19	And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work 
NEH.4.20	In what place 
NEH.4.21	So we labored in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. 
NEH.4.22	Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor on the day. 
NEH.4.23	So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, 
NEH.5.1	And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. 
NEH.5.2	For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, 
NEH.5.3	 also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth. 
NEH.5.4	There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, 
NEH.5.5	Yet now our flesh 
NEH.5.6	And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. 
NEH.5.7	 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them. 
NEH.5.8	And I said unto them, We, after our ability, have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing 
NEH.5.9	Also I said, It 
NEH.5.10	I likewise, 
NEH.5.11	Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth 
NEH.5.12	Then said they, We will restore 
NEH.5.13	Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the 
NEH.5.14	Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerx´es the king, 
NEH.5.15	But the former governors that 
NEH.5.16	Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants 
NEH.5.17	Moreover 
NEH.5.18	Now 
NEH.5.19	Think upon me, my God, for good, 
NEH.6.1	Now it came to pass, when Sanbal´lat, and Tobi´ah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and 
NEH.6.2	that Sanbal´lat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in 
NEH.6.3	And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I 
NEH.6.4	Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. 
NEH.6.5	Then sent Sanbal´lat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; 
NEH.6.6	wherein 
NEH.6.7	And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, 
NEH.6.8	Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. 
NEH.6.9	For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, 
NEH.6.10	Afterward I came unto the house of Shemai´ah the son of Delai´ah the son of Mehet´abeel, who 
NEH.6.11	And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who 
NEH.6.12	And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobi´ah and Sanbal´lat had hired him. 
NEH.6.13	Therefore 
NEH.6.14	My God, think thou upon Tobi´ah and Sanbal´lat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadi´ah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth 
NEH.6.16	And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard 
NEH.6.17	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobi´ah, and 
NEH.6.18	For 
NEH.6.19	Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. 
NEH.7.1	Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, 
NEH.7.2	that I gave my brother Hana´ni, and Hanani´ah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he 
NEH.7.3	And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar 
NEH.7.4	Now the city 
NEH.7.5	And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,
NEH.7.6	These 
NEH.7.7	who came with Zerub´babel, Jesh´u-a, Nehemi´ah, Azari´ah, Ra-ami´ah, Nahama´ni, Mor´decai, Bilshan, Mis´pe-reth, Big´vai, Nehum, Ba´anah.

NEH.7.71	And 
NEH.7.72	And 
NEH.7.73	And when the seventh month came, the children of Israel 
NEH.8.1	And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that 
NEH.8.2	And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. 
NEH.8.3	And he read therein before the street that 
NEH.8.4	And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithi´ah, and Shema, and Anai´ah, and Uri´jah, and Hilki´ah, and Ma-asei´ah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedai´ah, and Mish´a-el, and Malchi´ah, and Hashum, and Hashbada´na, Zechari´ah, 
NEH.8.5	And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up: 
NEH.8.6	and Ezra blessed the 
NEH.8.7	Also Jesh´u-a, and Bani, and Sherebi´ah, Jamin, Akkub, Shab´bethai, Hodi´jah, Ma-asei´ah, Keli´ta, Azari´ah, Joz´abad, Hanan, Pelai´ah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people 
NEH.8.8	So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused 
NEH.8.9	And Nehemi´ah, which 
NEH.8.10	Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for 
NEH.8.11	So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day 
NEH.8.12	And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.
NEH.8.13	And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law. 
NEH.8.14	 And they found written in the law which the 
NEH.8.15	and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as 
NEH.8.16	So the people went forth, and brought 
NEH.8.17	And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jesh´u-a the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness. 
NEH.8.18	Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day 
NEH.9.1	Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.

NEH.9.6	Thou, 
NEH.9.7	 Thou 
NEH.9.8	 and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Per´izzites, and the Jeb´usites, and the Gir´gashites, to give 
NEH.9.10	 and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as 
NEH.9.11	 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters. 
NEH.9.12	 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go. 
NEH.9.13	 Thou camest down also upon mount Si´nai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: 
NEH.9.14	and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant: 
NEH.9.15	 and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
NEH.9.17	 and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou 
NEH.9.18	 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This 
NEH.9.19	 yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go. 
NEH.9.20	Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. 
NEH.9.21	Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, 
NEH.9.22	 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. 
NEH.9.23	 Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess 
NEH.9.24	 So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would. 
NEH.9.25	 And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
NEH.9.27	Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest 
NEH.9.28	But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest 
NEH.9.29	 and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. 
NEH.9.30	 Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hands of the people of the lands. 
NEH.9.31	Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou 
NEH.9.33	Howbeit thou 
NEH.9.34	neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them. 
NEH.9.35	For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. 
NEH.9.36	Behold, we 
NEH.9.37	and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we 
NEH.9.38	And because of all this we make a sure

NEH.12.9	Also Bakbuki´ah and Unni, their brethren, 
NEH.12.10	And Jesh´u-a begat Joi´akim, Joi´akim also begat Eli´ashib, and Eli´ashib begat Joi´ada, 
NEH.12.11	and Joi´ada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jad´du-a.
NEH.12.12	And in the days of Joi´akim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of Serai´ah, Merai´ah; of Jeremiah, Hanani´ah; 
NEH.12.13	of Ezra, Meshul´lam; of Amari´ah, Jeho´hanan; 
NEH.12.14	of Mel´icu, Jonathan; of Shebani´ah, Joseph;

NEH.12.20	of Sal´lai, Kal´lai; of Amok, Eber; 
NEH.12.21	of Hilki´ah, Hashabi´ah; of Jedai´ah, Nethan´e-el.
NEH.12.22	The Levites in the days of Eli´ashib, Joi´ada, and Jo´hanan, and Jad´du-a, 
NEH.12.23	The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, 
NEH.12.24	And the chief of the Levites: Hashabi´ah, Sherebi´ah, and Jesh´u-a the son of Kad´mi-el, with their brethren over against them, to praise 
NEH.12.25	Mattani´ah, and Bakbuki´ah, Obadi´ah, Meshul´lam, Talmon, Akkub, 
NEH.12.26	These 
NEH.12.27	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, 
NEH.12.28	And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netoph´athi; 
NEH.12.29	also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azma´veth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
NEH.12.31	Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great 
NEH.12.32	and after them went Hoshai´ah, and half of the princes of Judah, 
NEH.12.33	and Azari´ah, Ezra, and Meshul´lam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemai´ah, and Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	and 
NEH.12.36	and his brethren, Shemai´ah, and Az´arael, Mil´alai, Gil´alai, Ma´ai, Nethan´e-el, and Judah, Hana´ni, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them. 
NEH.12.37	And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.
NEH.12.38	And the other 
NEH.12.39	and from above the gate of E´phra-im, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Han´aneel, and the tower of Me´ah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate. 
NEH.12.40	So stood the two 
NEH.12.41	and the priests; Eli´akim, Ma-asei´ah, Mini-a´min, Michai´ah, Eli-oe´nai, Zechari´ah, 
NEH.12.42	and Ma-asei´ah, and Shemai´ah, and Ele-a´zar, and Uzzi, and Jeho´hanan, and Malchi´jah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahi´ah 
NEH.12.43	Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
NEH.12.44	And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited. 
NEH.12.45	 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, 
NEH.12.46	For in the days of David and Asaph of old 
NEH.12.47	And all Israel in the days of Zerub´babel, and in the days of Nehemi´ah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified 
NEH.13.2	 because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Ba´laam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
NEH.13.3	Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
NEH.13.4	And before this, Eli´ashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, 
NEH.13.5	and he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded 
NEH.13.6	But in all this 
NEH.13.7	and I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eli´ashib did for Tobi´ah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. 
NEH.13.8	And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobi´ah out of the chamber. 
NEH.13.9	Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.
NEH.13.11	Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. 
NEH.13.12	 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries. 
NEH.13.13	And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemi´ah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedai´ah: and next to them 
NEH.13.14	Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
NEH.13.16	There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.17	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing 
NEH.13.18	Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
NEH.13.19	And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and 
NEH.13.20	So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. 
NEH.13.21	Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do 
NEH.13.22	And I commanded the Levites, that they should cleanse themselves, and 
NEH.13.24	and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people. 
NEH.13.25	And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, 
NEH.13.26	 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin. 
NEH.13.27	Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?
NEH.13.29	Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
NEH.13.30	Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business; 
NEH.13.31	and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
EST.1.2	 in those days, when the king Ahasue´rus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which 
EST.1.3	in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Me´di-a, the nobles and princes of the provinces, 
EST.1.4	when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, 
EST.1.5	And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace; 
EST.1.6	 white, green, and blue 
EST.1.7	And they gave 
EST.1.8	And the drinking 
EST.1.9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women 
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehu´man, Biztha, Harbo´na, Bigtha, and Abag´tha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasue´rus the king, 
EST.1.11	to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she 
EST.1.12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by 
EST.1.13	Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so 
EST.1.14	and the next unto him 
EST.1.15	What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasue´rus by the chamberlains? 
EST.1.16	And Memu´can answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that 
EST.1.17	For 
EST.1.18	 shall the ladies of Persia and Me´di-a say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus 
EST.1.19	If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasue´rus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. 
EST.1.20	And when the king's decree, which he shall make, shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honor, both to great and small. 
EST.1.21	And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memu´can: 
EST.1.22	for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that 
EST.2.1	After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasue´rus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. 
EST.2.2	Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king: 
EST.2.3	and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given 
EST.2.4	and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
EST.2.6	 who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconi´ah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnez´zar the king of Babylon had carried away. 
EST.2.7	And he brought up Hadas´sah, that 
EST.2.8	So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of He´gai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of He´gai, keeper of the women. 
EST.2.9	And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, 
EST.2.10	Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred: for Mor´decai had charged her that she should not show 
EST.2.11	And Mor´decai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
EST.2.12	Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasue´rus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, 
EST.2.13	then thus came 
EST.2.14	In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Sha-ash´gaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
EST.2.15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Ab´ihail the uncle of Mor´decai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what He´gai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her. 
EST.2.16	So Esther was taken unto king Ahasue´rus into his house royal in the tenth month, which 
EST.2.17	And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, 
EST.2.19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mor´decai sat in the king's gate. 
EST.2.20	Esther had not 
EST.2.21	In those days, while Mor´decai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasue´rus. 
EST.2.22	And the thing was known to Mor´decai, who told 
EST.2.23	And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
EST.3.1	After these things did king Ahasue´rus promote Haman the son of Hammeda´tha the A´gagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that 
EST.3.2	And all the king's servants, that 
EST.3.3	Then the king's servants, which 
EST.3.4	Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mor´decai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he 
EST.3.5	And when Haman saw that Mor´decai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath. 
EST.3.6	And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mor´decai alone; for they had showed him the people of Mor´decai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that 
EST.3.7	In the first month, that 
EST.3.8	And Haman said unto king Ahasue´rus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws 
EST.3.9	If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring 
EST.3.10	And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammeda´tha the A´gagite, the Jews' enemy. 
EST.3.11	And the king said unto Haman, The silver 
EST.3.12	Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that 
EST.3.13	And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, 
EST.3.14	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day. 
EST.3.15	The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.
EST.4.1	When Mor´decai perceived all that was done, Mor´decai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; 
EST.4.2	and came even before the king's gate: for none 
EST.4.3	And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, 
EST.4.4	So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told 
EST.4.5	Then called Esther for Hatach, 
EST.4.6	So Hatach went forth to Mor´decai unto the street of the city, which 
EST.4.7	And Mor´decai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them. 
EST.4.8	Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show 
EST.4.9	And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mor´decai. 
EST.4.10	Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mor´decai; 
EST.4.11	All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, 
EST.4.12	And they told to Mor´decai Esther's words. 
EST.4.13	Then Mor´decai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews. 
EST.4.14	For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, 
EST.4.15	Then Esther bade 
EST.4.16	Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which 
EST.4.17	So Mor´decai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
EST.5.1	Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on 
EST.5.2	And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, 
EST.5.3	Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what 
EST.5.4	And Esther answered, If 
EST.5.5	Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
EST.5.6	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What 
EST.5.7	Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request 
EST.5.8	If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said.
EST.5.9	Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mor´decai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mor´decai. 
EST.5.10	Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife. 
EST.5.11	And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all 
EST.5.12	Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the king. 
EST.5.13	Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mor´decai the Jew sitting at the king's gate. 
EST.5.14	Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak thou unto the king that Mor´decai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
EST.6.1	On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. 
EST.6.2	 And it was found written, that Mor´decai had told of Bigtha´na and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasue´rus. 
EST.6.3	And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been done to Mor´decai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. 
EST.6.4	And the king said, Who 
EST.6.5	And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. 
EST.6.6	So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself? 
EST.6.7	And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor, 
EST.6.8	let the royal apparel be brought which the king 
EST.6.9	and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man 
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, 
EST.6.11	Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mor´decai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
EST.6.12	And Mor´decai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered. 
EST.6.13	And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every 
EST.6.14	And while they 
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. 
EST.7.2	And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What 
EST.7.3	Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request: 
EST.7.4	for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage. 
EST.7.5	Then the king Ahasue´rus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so? 
EST.7.6	And Esther said, The adversary and enemy 
EST.7.7	And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath 
EST.7.8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther 
EST.7.9	And Harbo´na, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mor´decai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon. 
EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mor´decai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.
EST.8.1	On that day did the king Ahasue´rus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mor´decai came before the king; for Esther had told what he 
EST.8.2	And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mor´decai. And Esther set Mor´decai over the house of Haman.
EST.8.3	And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the A´gagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king, 
EST.8.5	and said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing 
EST.8.6	for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? 
EST.8.7	Then the king Ahasue´rus said unto Esther the queen and to Mor´decai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. 
EST.8.8	Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal 
EST.8.9	Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that 
EST.8.10	And he wrote in the king Ahasue´rus' name, and sealed 
EST.8.11	wherein the king granted the Jews which 
EST.8.12	upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasue´rus, 
EST.8.13	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province 
EST.8.14	 the posts that rode upon mules 
EST.8.15	And Mor´decai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. 
EST.8.16	The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor. 
EST.8.17	And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
EST.9.1	Now in the twelfth month, that 
EST.9.2	the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasue´rus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people. 
EST.9.3	And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mor´decai fell upon them. 
EST.9.4	For Mor´decai 
EST.9.5	Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them. 
EST.9.6	And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. 
EST.9.7	And Parshanda´tha, and Dalphon, and Aspa´tha, 
EST.9.8	and Pora´tha, and Adali´a, and Arida´tha, 
EST.9.9	and Parmash´ta, and Ar´isai, and Ar´idai, and Vajeza´tha, 
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammeda´tha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.
EST.9.11	On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king. 
EST.9.12	And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what 
EST.9.13	Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which 
EST.9.14	And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons. 
EST.9.15	For the Jews that 
EST.9.16	But the other Jews that 
EST.9.17	on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 
EST.9.18	But the Jews that 
EST.9.19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar 
EST.9.20	And Mor´decai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that 
EST.9.21	to establish 
EST.9.22	as the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
EST.9.23	And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mor´decai had written unto them; 
EST.9.24	 because Haman the son of Hammeda´tha, the A´gagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that 
EST.9.25	but when 
EST.9.26	Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and 
EST.9.27	the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their 
EST.9.28	and 
EST.9.29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Ab´ihail, and Mor´decai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim. 
EST.9.30	And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasue´rus, 
EST.9.31	to confirm these days of Purim in their times 
EST.9.32	And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
EST.10.1	And the king Ahasue´rus laid a tribute upon the land, and 
EST.10.2	And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mor´decai, whereunto the king advanced him, 
EST.10.3	For Mor´decai the Jew 
JOB.1.1	There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name 
JOB.1.2	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.1.3	His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. 
JOB.1.4	And his sons went and feasted 
JOB.1.5	And it was so, when the days of 
JOB.1.6	Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the 
JOB.1.7	And the 
JOB.1.8	And the 
JOB.1.9	 Then Satan answered the 
JOB.1.10	Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
JOB.1.11	But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. 
JOB.1.12	And the 
JOB.1.13	And there was a day when his sons and his daughters 
JOB.1.14	and there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 
JOB.1.15	and the Sabe´ans fell 
JOB.1.16	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
JOB.1.17	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chalde´ans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
JOB.1.18	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters 
JOB.1.19	and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
JOB.1.20	Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 
JOB.1.21	and said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the 
JOB.1.22	In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
JOB.2.1	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the 
JOB.2.2	And the 
JOB.2.3	And the 
JOB.2.4	And Satan answered the 
JOB.2.5	But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. 
JOB.2.6	And the 
JOB.2.7	So went Satan forth from the presence of the 
JOB.2.8	And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. 
JOB.2.9	Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.
JOB.2.10	But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
JOB.2.11	Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; El´iphaz the Te´manite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Na´amathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him, and to comfort him. 
JOB.2.12	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
JOB.2.13	So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that 
JOB.3.2	And Job spake, and said,
JOB.3.3	Let the day perish wherein I was born,
JOB.3.3	and the night 
JOB.3.4	Let that day be darkness;
JOB.3.4	let not God regard it from above,
JOB.3.4	neither let the light shine upon it.
JOB.3.5	Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it;
JOB.3.5	let a cloud dwell upon it;
JOB.3.5	let the blackness of the day terrify it.
JOB.3.6	let it not be joined unto the days of the year;
JOB.3.6	let it not come into the number of the months.
JOB.3.7	Lo, let that night be solitary;
JOB.3.7	let no joyful voice come therein.
JOB.3.8	Let them curse it that curse the day,
JOB.3.8	who are ready to raise up their mourning.
JOB.3.9	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark;
JOB.3.9	let it look for light, but 
JOB.3.9	neither let it see the dawning of the day:
JOB.3.10	because it shut not up the doors of my 
JOB.3.10	nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
JOB.3.11	Why died I not from the womb?
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees prevent me?
JOB.3.12	Or why the breasts that I should suck?
JOB.3.13	For now should I have lain still and been quiet,
JOB.3.13	I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
JOB.3.14	with kings and counselors of the earth,
JOB.3.14	which built desolate places for themselves;
JOB.3.15	or with princes that had gold,
JOB.3.15	who filled their houses with silver:
JOB.3.16	or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been;
JOB.3.16	as infants 
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease 
JOB.3.17	and there the weary be at rest.
JOB.3.18	they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
JOB.3.19	The small and great are there;
JOB.3.19	and the servant 
JOB.3.20	Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
JOB.3.20	and life unto the bitter 
JOB.3.21	and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
JOB.3.22	which rejoice exceedingly, 
JOB.3.22	when they can find the grave?
JOB.3.23	and whom God hath hedged in?
JOB.3.24	For my sighing cometh before I eat,
JOB.3.24	and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
JOB.3.25	For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me,
JOB.3.25	and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
JOB.3.26	I was not in safety, neither had I rest,
JOB.3.26	neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
JOB.4.1	Then El´iphaz the Te´manite answered and said,
JOB.4.2	But who can withhold himself from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Behold, thou hast instructed many,
JOB.4.3	and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
JOB.4.4	Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
JOB.4.4	and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
JOB.4.5	But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest;
JOB.4.5	it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
JOB.4.6	thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
JOB.4.7	Remember, I pray thee, who 
JOB.4.7	Or where were the righteous cut off?
JOB.4.8	Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
JOB.4.8	and sow wickedness, reap the same.
JOB.4.9	By the blast of God they perish,
JOB.4.9	and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
JOB.4.10	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
JOB.4.10	and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
JOB.4.11	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,
JOB.4.11	and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
JOB.4.12	Now a thing was secretly brought to me,
JOB.4.12	and mine ear received a little thereof.
JOB.4.13	In thoughts from the visions of the night,
JOB.4.13	when deep sleep falleth on men,
JOB.4.14	fear came upon me, and trembling,
JOB.4.14	which made all my bones to shake.
JOB.4.15	Then a spirit passed before my face;
JOB.4.15	the hair of my flesh stood up:
JOB.4.16	it stood still,
JOB.4.16	but I could not discern the form thereof:
JOB.4.16	an image 
JOB.4.17	Shall mortal man be more just than God?
JOB.4.17	Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
JOB.4.18	Behold, he put no trust in his servants;
JOB.4.18	and his angels he charged with folly:
JOB.4.19	how much less 
JOB.4.19	whose foundation 
JOB.4.20	They are destroyed from morning to evening:
JOB.4.20	they perish for ever without any regarding 
JOB.4.21	Doth not their excellency 
JOB.4.21	They die, even without wisdom.
JOB.5.1	Call now, if there be any that will answer thee;
JOB.5.1	and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
JOB.5.2	For wrath killeth the foolish man,
JOB.5.2	and envy slayeth the silly one.
JOB.5.3	I have seen the foolish taking root:
JOB.5.3	but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
JOB.5.4	His children are far from safety,
JOB.5.4	and they are crushed in the gate,
JOB.5.4	neither 
JOB.5.5	Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,
JOB.5.5	and taketh it even out of the thorns,
JOB.5.5	and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
JOB.5.6	Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust,
JOB.5.6	neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
JOB.5.7	yet man is born unto trouble,
JOB.5.7	as the sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	I would seek unto God,
JOB.5.8	and unto God would I commit my cause:
JOB.5.9	which doeth great things and unsearchable;
JOB.5.9	marvelous things without number:
JOB.5.10	who giveth rain upon the earth,
JOB.5.10	and sendeth waters upon the fields:
JOB.5.11	to set up on high those that be low;
JOB.5.11	that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
JOB.5.12	He disappointeth the devices of the crafty,
JOB.5.12	so that their hands cannot perform 
JOB.5.13	and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
JOB.5.14	They meet with darkness in the daytime,
JOB.5.14	and grope in the noonday as in the night.
JOB.5.15	But he saveth the poor from the sword,
JOB.5.15	from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
JOB.5.16	So the poor hath hope,
JOB.5.16	and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
JOB.5.17	therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
JOB.5.18	for he maketh sore, and bindeth up:
JOB.5.18	he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
JOB.5.19	He shall deliver thee in six troubles:
JOB.5.19	yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
JOB.5.20	In famine he shall redeem thee from death:
JOB.5.20	and in war from the power of the sword.
JOB.5.21	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue:
JOB.5.21	neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
JOB.5.22	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh:
JOB.5.22	neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
JOB.5.23	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field:
JOB.5.23	and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
JOB.5.24	And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle 
JOB.5.24	and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
JOB.5.25	Thou shalt know also that thy seed 
JOB.5.25	and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	Thou shalt come to 
JOB.5.26	like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
JOB.5.27	Lo this, we have searched it, so it 
JOB.5.27	hear it, and know thou 
JOB.6.1	But Job answered and said,
JOB.6.2	Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed,
JOB.6.2	and my calamity laid in the balances together!
JOB.6.3	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
JOB.6.3	therefore my words are swallowed up.
JOB.6.4	For the arrows of the Almighty 
JOB.6.4	the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit:
JOB.6.4	the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
JOB.6.5	Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?
JOB.6.5	Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
JOB.6.6	Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt?
JOB.6.6	Or is there 
JOB.6.7	The things 
JOB.6.8	Oh that I might have my request;
JOB.6.8	and that God would grant 
JOB.6.9	Even that it would please God to destroy me;
JOB.6.9	that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
JOB.6.10	Then should I yet have comfort;
JOB.6.10	yea, I would harden myself in sorrow:
JOB.6.10	let him not spare;
JOB.6.10	for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	What 
JOB.6.11	And what 
JOB.6.12	Or 
JOB.6.13	And is wisdom driven quite from me?
JOB.6.14	To him that is afflicted pity 
JOB.6.14	but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,
JOB.6.16	which are blackish by reason of the ice,
JOB.6.17	what time they wax warm, they vanish:
JOB.6.17	when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
JOB.6.18	The paths of their way are turned aside;
JOB.6.18	they go to nothing, and perish.
JOB.6.19	The troops of Tema looked,
JOB.6.19	the companies of Sheba waited for them.
JOB.6.20	They were confounded because they had hoped;
JOB.6.20	they came thither, and were ashamed.
JOB.6.21	For now ye are nothing;
JOB.6.21	ye see 
JOB.6.22	Did I say, Bring unto me?
JOB.6.22	or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
JOB.6.23	or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand?
JOB.6.23	or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
JOB.6.24	Teach me, and I will hold my tongue:
JOB.6.24	and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
JOB.6.25	How forcible are right words!
JOB.6.25	But what doth your arguing reprove?
JOB.6.26	Do ye imagine to reprove words,
JOB.6.26	and the speeches of one that is desperate, 
JOB.6.27	Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless,
JOB.6.27	and ye dig 
JOB.6.28	Now therefore be content, look upon me;
JOB.6.28	for 
JOB.6.29	Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity;
JOB.6.29	yea, return again, my righteousness 
JOB.6.30	Is there iniquity in my tongue?
JOB.6.30	Cannot my taste discern perverse things?
JOB.7.2	As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow,
JOB.7.2	and as a hireling looketh for 
JOB.7.3	so am I made to possess months of vanity,
JOB.7.3	and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down, I say,
JOB.7.4	When shall I arise, and the night be gone?
JOB.7.4	And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
JOB.7.5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;
JOB.7.5	my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
JOB.7.6	My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,
JOB.7.6	and are spent without hope.
JOB.7.7	O remember that my life 
JOB.7.7	mine eye shall no more see good.
JOB.7.8	The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no 
JOB.7.8	thine eyes 
JOB.7.9	so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no 
JOB.7.10	He shall return no more to his house,
JOB.7.10	neither shall his place know him any more.
JOB.7.11	Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;
JOB.7.11	I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
JOB.7.11	I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.7.12	that thou settest a watch over me?
JOB.7.13	When I say, My bed shall comfort me,
JOB.7.13	my couch shall ease my complaint;
JOB.7.14	then thou scarest me with dreams,
JOB.7.14	and terrifiest me through visions:
JOB.7.15	so that my soul chooseth strangling,
JOB.7.16	I loathe 
JOB.7.16	let me alone; for my days 
JOB.7.17	and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
JOB.7.18	and 
JOB.7.19	How long wilt thou not depart from me,
JOB.7.19	nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
JOB.7.20	I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee,
JOB.7.20	O thou preserver of men?
JOB.7.20	Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee,
JOB.7.20	so that I am a burden to myself?
JOB.7.21	And why dost thou not pardon my transgression,
JOB.7.21	and take away mine iniquity?
JOB.7.21	For now shall I sleep in the dust;
JOB.7.21	and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I 
JOB.8.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
JOB.8.2	How long wilt thou speak these 
JOB.8.2	And 
JOB.8.3	Doth God pervert judgment?
JOB.8.3	Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
JOB.8.4	If thy children have sinned against him,
JOB.8.4	and he have cast them away for their transgression;
JOB.8.5	if thou wouldest seek unto God betimes,
JOB.8.5	and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
JOB.8.6	if thou 
JOB.8.6	surely now he would awake for thee,
JOB.8.6	and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
JOB.8.7	Though thy beginning was small,
JOB.8.7	yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
JOB.8.8	For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age,
JOB.8.8	and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
JOB.8.9	(for we 
JOB.8.9	because our days upon earth 
JOB.8.10	Shall not they teach thee, 
JOB.8.10	and utter words out of their heart?
JOB.8.11	Can the rush grow up without mire?
JOB.8.11	Can the flag grow without water?
JOB.8.12	Whilst it 
JOB.8.12	it withereth before any 
JOB.8.13	So 
JOB.8.13	and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
JOB.8.14	whose hope shall be cut off,
JOB.8.14	and whose trust 
JOB.8.15	He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:
JOB.8.15	he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
JOB.8.16	He 
JOB.8.16	and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
JOB.8.17	His roots are wrapped about the heap,
JOB.8.18	If he destroy him from his place,
JOB.8.18	then 
JOB.8.19	Behold, this 
JOB.8.19	and out of the earth shall others grow.
JOB.8.20	Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,
JOB.8.20	neither will he help the evildoers:
JOB.8.21	till he fill thy mouth with laughing,
JOB.8.21	and thy lips with rejoicing.
JOB.8.22	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame;
JOB.8.22	and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.9.2	I know 
JOB.9.2	but how should man be just with God?
JOB.9.3	If he will contend with him,
JOB.9.3	he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
JOB.9.4	who hath hardened 
JOB.9.5	which removeth the mountains, and they know not;
JOB.9.5	which overturneth them in his anger;
JOB.9.6	which shaketh the earth out of her place,
JOB.9.6	and the pillars thereof tremble;
JOB.9.7	which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not;
JOB.9.7	and sealeth up the stars;
JOB.9.8	which alone spreadeth out the heavens,
JOB.9.8	and treadeth upon the waves of the sea;
JOB.9.9	and the chambers of the south;
JOB.9.10	which doeth great things past finding out;
JOB.9.10	yea, and wonders without number.
JOB.9.11	Lo, he goeth by me, and I see 
JOB.9.11	he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
JOB.9.12	Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him?
JOB.9.12	Who will say unto him, What doest thou?
JOB.9.13	the proud helpers do stoop under him.
JOB.9.14	How much less shall I answer him,
JOB.9.15	whom, though I were righteous, 
JOB.9.16	If I had called, and he had answered me;
JOB.9.17	For he breaketh me with a tempest,
JOB.9.17	and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
JOB.9.18	He will not suffer me to take my breath,
JOB.9.18	but filleth me with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	If 
JOB.9.19	and if of judgment, who shall set me a time 
JOB.9.20	If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me:
JOB.9.21	I would despise my life.
JOB.9.22	This 
JOB.9.22	He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
JOB.9.23	If the scourge slay suddenly,
JOB.9.23	he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked:
JOB.9.24	he covereth the faces of the judges thereof;
JOB.9.24	if not, where, 
JOB.9.25	Now my days are swifter than a post:
JOB.9.25	they flee away, they see no good.
JOB.9.26	They are passed away as the swift ships:
JOB.9.26	as the eagle 
JOB.9.27	If I say, I will forget my complaint,
JOB.9.27	I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort 
JOB.9.28	I am afraid of all my sorrows,
JOB.9.28	I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
JOB.9.29	why then labor I in vain?
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with snow water,
JOB.9.30	and make my hands never so clean;
JOB.9.31	yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch,
JOB.9.31	and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
JOB.9.32	For 
JOB.9.33	Neither is there any daysman betwixt us,
JOB.9.34	Let him take his rod away from me,
JOB.9.34	and let not his fear terrify me:
JOB.9.35	but 
JOB.10.1	My soul is weary of my life;
JOB.10.1	I will leave my complaint upon myself;
JOB.10.1	I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will say unto God, Do not condemn me;
JOB.10.2	show me wherefore thou contendest with me.
JOB.10.3	that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands,
JOB.10.3	and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Hast thou eyes of flesh?
JOB.10.4	Or seest thou as man seeth?
JOB.10.6	that thou inquirest after mine iniquity,
JOB.10.6	and searchest after my sin?
JOB.10.7	Thou knowest that I am not wicked;
JOB.10.7	and 
JOB.10.8	Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about;
JOB.10.8	yet thou dost destroy me.
JOB.10.9	Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;
JOB.10.9	and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
JOB.10.10	Hast thou not poured me out as milk,
JOB.10.10	and curdled me like cheese?
JOB.10.11	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,
JOB.10.11	and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
JOB.10.12	Thou hast granted me life and favor,
JOB.10.12	and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
JOB.10.13	And these 
JOB.10.13	I know that this 
JOB.10.14	If I sin, then thou markest me,
JOB.10.14	and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
JOB.10.15	If I be wicked, woe unto me;
JOB.10.15	and 
JOB.10.16	for it increaseth.
JOB.10.16	Thou huntest me as a fierce lion:
JOB.10.16	and again thou showest thyself marvelous upon me.
JOB.10.17	Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me;
JOB.10.17	changes and war 
JOB.10.18	Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb?
JOB.10.18	Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
JOB.10.19	I should have been as though I had not been;
JOB.10.19	I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
JOB.10.21	before I go 
JOB.10.22	a land of darkness, as darkness 
JOB.10.22	and 
JOB.11.1	Then answered Zophar the Na´amathite, and said,
JOB.11.2	Should not the multitude of words be answered?
JOB.11.2	And should a man full of talk be justified?
JOB.11.3	Should thy lies make men hold their peace?
JOB.11.3	And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
JOB.11.4	For thou hast said, My doctrine 
JOB.11.4	and I am clean in thine eyes.
JOB.11.5	But oh that God would speak,
JOB.11.5	and open his lips against thee;
JOB.11.6	and that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom,
JOB.11.6	that 
JOB.11.6	Know therefore that God exacteth of thee 
JOB.11.7	Canst thou by searching find out God?
JOB.11.7	Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
JOB.11.8	deeper than hell;
JOB.11.9	The measure thereof 
JOB.11.9	and broader than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If he cut off, and shut up,
JOB.11.10	or gather together, then who can hinder him?
JOB.11.11	For he knoweth vain men:
JOB.11.11	he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider 
JOB.11.12	For vain man would be wise,
JOB.11.12	though man be born 
JOB.11.13	If thou prepare thine heart,
JOB.11.13	and stretch out thine hands toward him;
JOB.11.14	if iniquity 
JOB.11.14	and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
JOB.11.15	For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;
JOB.11.15	yea, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear:
JOB.11.16	because thou shalt forget 
JOB.11.17	and 
JOB.11.17	thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
JOB.11.18	And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope;
JOB.11.18	yea, thou shalt dig 
JOB.11.19	Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make 
JOB.11.19	yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
JOB.11.20	and they shall not escape,
JOB.11.20	and their hope 
JOB.12.1	And Job answered and said,
JOB.12.2	No doubt but ye 
JOB.12.2	and wisdom shall die with you.
JOB.12.3	But I have understanding as well as you;
JOB.12.3	I 
JOB.12.3	yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
JOB.12.4	I am 
JOB.12.4	who calleth upon God, and he answereth him:
JOB.12.4	the just upright 
JOB.12.5	He that is ready to slip with 
JOB.12.6	The tabernacles of robbers prosper,
JOB.12.6	and they that provoke God are secure;
JOB.12.6	into whose hand God bringeth 
JOB.12.7	But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
JOB.12.7	and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
JOB.12.8	or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee;
JOB.12.8	and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
JOB.12.9	Who knoweth not in all these
JOB.12.9	that the hand of the 
JOB.12.10	in whose hand 
JOB.12.10	and the breath of all mankind.
JOB.12.11	Doth not the ear try words?
JOB.12.11	and the mouth taste his meat?
JOB.12.12	With the ancient 
JOB.12.12	and in length of days understanding.
JOB.12.13	With him
JOB.12.13	he hath counsel and understanding.
JOB.12.14	Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again:
JOB.12.14	he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
JOB.12.15	Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up:
JOB.12.15	also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
JOB.12.16	With him 
JOB.12.16	the deceived and the deceiver 
JOB.12.17	He leadeth counselors away spoiled,
JOB.12.17	and maketh the judges fools.
JOB.12.18	He looseth the bond of kings,
JOB.12.18	and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
JOB.12.19	He leadeth princes away spoiled,
JOB.12.19	and overthroweth the mighty.
JOB.12.20	He removeth away the speech of the trusty,
JOB.12.20	and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
JOB.12.21	He poureth contempt upon princes,
JOB.12.21	and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
JOB.12.22	He discovereth deep things out of darkness,
JOB.12.22	and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
JOB.12.23	He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them:
JOB.12.23	he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them 
JOB.12.24	He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth,
JOB.12.24	and causeth them to wander in a wilderness 
JOB.12.25	They grope in the dark without light,
JOB.12.25	and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
JOB.13.1	Lo, mine eye hath seen all 
JOB.13.1	mine ear hath heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	What ye know, 
JOB.13.2	I 
JOB.13.3	Surely I would speak to the Almighty,
JOB.13.3	and I desire to reason with God.
JOB.13.4	But ye 
JOB.13.4	ye 
JOB.13.5	Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace!
JOB.13.5	And it should be your wisdom.
JOB.13.6	Hear now my reasoning,
JOB.13.6	and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Will ye speak wickedly for God?
JOB.13.7	and talk deceitfully for him?
JOB.13.8	Will ye accept his person?
JOB.13.8	Will ye contend for God?
JOB.13.9	Is it good that he should search you out?
JOB.13.9	Or as one man mocketh another, do ye 
JOB.13.10	He will surely reprove you,
JOB.13.10	if ye do secretly accept persons.
JOB.13.11	Shall not his excellency make you afraid?
JOB.13.11	and his dread fall upon you?
JOB.13.12	Your remembrances 
JOB.13.12	your bodies to bodies of clay.
JOB.13.13	Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak,
JOB.13.13	and let come on me what 
JOB.13.14	Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth,
JOB.13.14	and put my life in mine hand?
JOB.13.15	Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him:
JOB.13.15	but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
JOB.13.16	He also 
JOB.13.16	for a hypocrite shall not come before him.
JOB.13.17	Hear diligently my speech,
JOB.13.17	and my declaration with your ears.
JOB.13.18	Behold now, I have ordered 
JOB.13.18	I know that I shall be justified.
JOB.13.19	Who 
JOB.13.19	for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
JOB.13.20	Only do not two 
JOB.13.20	then I will not hide myself from thee.
JOB.13.21	Withdraw thine hand far from me:
JOB.13.21	and let not thy dread make me afraid.
JOB.13.22	Then call thou, and I will answer:
JOB.13.22	or let me speak, and answer thou me.
JOB.13.23	How many 
JOB.13.23	Make me to know my transgression and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
JOB.13.24	and holdest me for thine enemy?
JOB.13.25	Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro?
JOB.13.25	And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
JOB.13.26	For thou writest bitter things against me,
JOB.13.26	and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
JOB.13.27	Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks,
JOB.13.27	and lookest narrowly unto all my paths;
JOB.13.27	thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
JOB.13.28	And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth,
JOB.13.28	as a garment that is moth-eaten.
JOB.14.1	Man 
JOB.14.2	He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down:
JOB.14.2	he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
JOB.14.3	And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one,
JOB.14.3	and bringest me into judgment with thee?
JOB.14.4	Who can bring a clean 
JOB.14.4	Not one.
JOB.14.5	Seeing his days 
JOB.14.5	the number of his months 
JOB.14.5	thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
JOB.14.6	turn from him, that he may rest,
JOB.14.6	till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
JOB.14.7	For there is hope of a tree,
JOB.14.7	if it be cut down, that it will sprout again,
JOB.14.7	and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
JOB.14.8	Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
JOB.14.8	and the stock thereof die in the ground;
JOB.14.9	and bring forth boughs like a plant.
JOB.14.10	But man dieth, and wasteth away:
JOB.14.10	yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where 
JOB.14.11	and the flood decayeth and drieth up;
JOB.14.12	so man lieth down, and riseth not:
JOB.14.12	till the heavens 
JOB.14.12	nor be raised out of their sleep.
JOB.14.13	Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave,
JOB.14.13	that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past,
JOB.14.13	that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
JOB.14.14	If a man die, shall he live 
JOB.14.14	All the days of my appointed time will I wait,
JOB.14.14	till my change come.
JOB.14.15	Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee:
JOB.14.15	thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
JOB.14.16	For now thou numberest my steps:
JOB.14.16	dost thou not watch over my sin?
JOB.14.17	My transgression 
JOB.14.17	and thou sewest up mine iniquity.
JOB.14.18	And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought,
JOB.14.18	and the rock is removed out of his place.
JOB.14.19	The waters wear the stones:
JOB.14.19	thou washest away the things which grow 
JOB.14.19	and thou destroyest the hope of man.
JOB.14.20	Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth:
JOB.14.20	thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
JOB.14.21	His sons come to honor, and he knoweth 
JOB.14.21	and they are brought low, but he perceiveth 
JOB.14.22	But his flesh upon him shall have pain,
JOB.14.22	and his soul within him shall mourn.
JOB.15.1	Then answered El´iphaz the Te´manite, and said,
JOB.15.2	Should a wise man utter vain knowledge,
JOB.15.2	and fill his belly with the east wind?
JOB.15.3	Should he reason with unprofitable talk?
JOB.15.3	or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
JOB.15.4	Yea, thou castest off fear,
JOB.15.4	and restrainest prayer before God.
JOB.15.5	For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity,
JOB.15.5	and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
JOB.15.6	Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I:
JOB.15.6	yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
JOB.15.7	Or wast thou made before the hills?
JOB.15.8	Hast thou heard the secret of God?
JOB.15.8	And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
JOB.15.9	What knowest thou, that we know not?
JOB.15.10	With us 
JOB.15.10	much elder than thy father.
JOB.15.11	Is there any secret thing with thee?
JOB.15.12	Why doth thine heart carry thee away?
JOB.15.12	And what do thy eyes wink at,
JOB.15.13	that thou turnest thy spirit against God,
JOB.15.13	and lettest 
JOB.15.14	What 
JOB.15.14	and 
JOB.15.15	Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints;
JOB.15.15	yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
JOB.15.16	How much more abominable and filthy 
JOB.15.16	which drinketh iniquity like water?
JOB.15.17	I will show thee, hear me;
JOB.15.17	and that 
JOB.15.18	which wise men have told from their fathers,
JOB.15.18	and have not hid 
JOB.15.19	unto whom alone the earth was given,
JOB.15.19	and no stranger passed among them.
JOB.15.20	The wicked man travaileth with pain all 
JOB.15.20	and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
JOB.15.21	A dreadful sound 
JOB.15.21	in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
JOB.15.22	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness,
JOB.15.22	and he is waited for of the sword.
JOB.15.23	He wandereth abroad for bread, 
JOB.15.23	He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
JOB.15.24	Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid;
JOB.15.24	they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
JOB.15.25	For he stretcheth out his hand against God,
JOB.15.25	and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
JOB.15.26	He runneth upon him, 
JOB.15.26	upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
JOB.15.27	because he covereth his face with his fatness,
JOB.15.27	and maketh collops of fat on 
JOB.15.28	And he dwelleth in desolate cities,
JOB.15.28	which are ready to become heaps.
JOB.15.29	He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
JOB.15.29	neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
JOB.15.30	He shall not depart out of darkness;
JOB.15.30	the flame shall dry up his branches,
JOB.15.30	and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
JOB.15.31	Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity:
JOB.15.31	for vanity shall be his recompense.
JOB.15.32	It shall be accomplished before his time,
JOB.15.32	and his branch shall not be green.
JOB.15.33	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
JOB.15.33	and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
JOB.15.34	For the congregation of hypocrites 
JOB.15.34	and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
JOB.15.35	They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity,
JOB.15.35	and their belly prepareth deceit.
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.16.2	I have heard many such things:
JOB.16.2	miserable comforters 
JOB.16.3	Shall vain words have an end?
JOB.16.3	Or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
JOB.16.4	I also could speak as ye 
JOB.16.4	if your soul were in my soul's stead,
JOB.16.4	I could heap up words against you,
JOB.16.4	and shake mine head at you.
JOB.16.5	and the moving of my lips should assuage 
JOB.16.6	Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged:
JOB.16.6	and 
JOB.16.7	But now he hath made me weary:
JOB.16.7	thou hast made desolate all my company.
JOB.16.8	And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, 
JOB.16.8	and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
JOB.16.9	He teareth 
JOB.16.9	he gnasheth upon me with his teeth;
JOB.16.9	mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
JOB.16.10	They have gaped upon me with their mouth;
JOB.16.10	they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully;
JOB.16.10	they have gathered themselves together against me.
JOB.16.11	God hath delivered me to the ungodly,
JOB.16.11	and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
JOB.16.12	I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder:
JOB.16.12	he hath also taken 
JOB.16.12	and set me up for his mark.
JOB.16.13	His archers compass me round about,
JOB.16.13	he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;
JOB.16.13	he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
JOB.16.14	He breaketh me with breach upon breach;
JOB.16.14	he runneth upon me like a giant.
JOB.16.15	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
JOB.16.15	and defiled my horn in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is foul with weeping,
JOB.16.16	and on my eyelids 
JOB.16.17	not for 
JOB.16.17	also my prayer 
JOB.16.18	O earth, cover not thou my blood,
JOB.16.18	and let my cry have no place.
JOB.16.19	Also now, behold, my witness 
JOB.16.19	and my record 
JOB.16.20	My friends scorn me:
JOB.16.21	Oh that one might plead for a man with God,
JOB.16.21	as a man 
JOB.16.22	When a few years are come,
JOB.16.22	then I shall go the way 
JOB.17.1	My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct,
JOB.17.1	the graves 
JOB.17.2	And doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
JOB.17.3	Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee;
JOB.17.3	who 
JOB.17.4	For thou hast hid their heart from understanding:
JOB.17.4	therefore shalt thou not exalt 
JOB.17.5	He that speaketh flattery to 
JOB.17.5	even the eyes of his children shall fail.
JOB.17.6	He hath made me also a byword of the people;
JOB.17.6	and aforetime I was as a tabret.
JOB.17.7	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,
JOB.17.7	and all my members 
JOB.17.8	Upright 
JOB.17.8	and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
JOB.17.9	The righteous also shall hold on his way,
JOB.17.9	and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
JOB.17.10	But as for you all, do ye return, and come now:
JOB.17.10	for I cannot find 
JOB.17.11	My days are past, my purposes are broken off,
JOB.17.12	They change the night into day:
JOB.17.12	the light 
JOB.17.13	If I wait, the grave 
JOB.17.13	I have made my bed in the darkness.
JOB.17.14	I have said to corruption, Thou 
JOB.17.14	to the worm, 
JOB.17.15	And where 
JOB.17.15	As for my hope, who shall see it?
JOB.17.16	They shall go down to the bars of the pit,
JOB.17.16	when 
JOB.18.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
JOB.18.2	How long 
JOB.18.2	Mark, and afterward we will speak.
JOB.18.3	Wherefore are we counted as beasts,
JOB.18.4	He teareth himself in his anger:
JOB.18.4	shall the earth be forsaken for thee?
JOB.18.4	And shall the rock be removed out of his place?
JOB.18.5	Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out,
JOB.18.5	and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
JOB.18.6	The light shall be dark in his tabernacle,
JOB.18.6	and his candle shall be put out with him.
JOB.18.7	The steps of his strength shall be straitened,
JOB.18.7	and his own counsel shall cast him down.
JOB.18.8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
JOB.18.8	and he walketh upon a snare.
JOB.18.9	The gin shall take 
JOB.18.10	The snare 
JOB.18.10	and a trap for him in the way.
JOB.18.11	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,
JOB.18.11	and shall drive him to his feet.
JOB.18.12	His strength shall be hunger-bitten,
JOB.18.12	and destruction 
JOB.18.13	It shall devour the strength of his skin:
JOB.18.14	His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle,
JOB.18.14	and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because 
JOB.18.15	brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
JOB.18.16	His roots shall be dried up beneath,
JOB.18.16	and above shall his branch be cut off.
JOB.18.17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth,
JOB.18.17	and he shall have no name in the street.
JOB.18.18	He shall be driven from light into darkness,
JOB.18.18	and chased out of the world.
JOB.18.19	He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people,
JOB.18.19	nor any remaining in his dwellings.
JOB.18.20	They that come after 
JOB.18.20	as they that went before were affrighted.
JOB.18.21	Surely such 
JOB.18.21	and this 
JOB.19.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.19.2	How long will ye vex my soul,
JOB.19.2	and break me in pieces with words?
JOB.19.3	These ten times have ye reproached me:
JOB.19.3	ye are not ashamed 
JOB.19.4	And be it indeed 
JOB.19.4	mine error remaineth with myself.
JOB.19.5	If indeed ye will magnify 
JOB.19.5	and plead against me my reproach;
JOB.19.6	know now that God hath overthrown me,
JOB.19.6	and hath compassed me with his net.
JOB.19.7	Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:
JOB.19.7	I cry aloud, but 
JOB.19.8	He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass,
JOB.19.8	and he hath set darkness in my paths.
JOB.19.9	He hath stripped me of my glory,
JOB.19.9	and taken the crown 
JOB.19.10	He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone:
JOB.19.10	and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
JOB.19.11	He hath also kindled his wrath against me,
JOB.19.11	and he counteth me unto him as 
JOB.19.12	His troops come together, and raise up their way against me,
JOB.19.12	and encamp round about my tabernacle.
JOB.19.13	He hath put my brethren far from me,
JOB.19.13	and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My kinsfolk have failed,
JOB.19.14	and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	They that dwell in mine house, and my maids,
JOB.19.15	count me for a stranger:
JOB.19.15	I am an alien in their sight.
JOB.19.16	I called my servant, and he gave 
JOB.19.16	I entreated him with my mouth.
JOB.19.17	My breath is strange to my wife,
JOB.19.17	though I entreated for the children's 
JOB.19.18	Yea, young children despised me;
JOB.19.18	I arose, and they spake against me.
JOB.19.19	All my inward friends abhorred me:
JOB.19.19	and they whom I loved are turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
JOB.19.20	and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;
JOB.19.21	for the hand of God hath touched me.
JOB.19.22	Why do ye persecute me as God,
JOB.19.22	and are not satisfied with my flesh?
JOB.19.23	Oh that my words were now written!
JOB.19.23	Oh that they were printed in a book!
JOB.19.24	That they were graven with an iron pen and lead
JOB.19.24	in the rock for ever!
JOB.19.25	For I know 
JOB.19.25	and 
JOB.19.26	and 
JOB.19.26	yet in my flesh shall I see God:
JOB.19.27	whom I shall see for myself,
JOB.19.27	and mine eyes shall behold, and not another;
JOB.19.28	But ye should say, Why persecute we him,
JOB.19.28	seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
JOB.19.29	Be ye afraid of the sword:
JOB.19.29	for wrath 
JOB.19.29	that ye may know 
JOB.20.1	Then answered Zophar the Na´amathite, and said,
JOB.20.2	Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer,
JOB.20.2	and for 
JOB.20.3	I have heard the check of my reproach,
JOB.20.3	and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
JOB.20.4	Knowest thou 
JOB.20.4	since man was placed upon earth,
JOB.20.5	that the triumphing of the wicked 
JOB.20.5	and the joy of the hypocrite 
JOB.20.6	Though his excellency mount up to the heavens,
JOB.20.6	and his head reach unto the clouds;
JOB.20.7	they which have seen him shall say, Where 
JOB.20.8	He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:
JOB.20.8	yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
JOB.20.9	The eye also 
JOB.20.9	neither shall his place any more behold him.
JOB.20.10	His children shall seek to please the poor,
JOB.20.10	and his hands shall restore their goods.
JOB.20.11	His bones are full 
JOB.20.11	which shall lie down with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,
JOB.20.13	but keep it still within his mouth;
JOB.20.15	He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again:
JOB.20.15	God shall cast them out of his belly.
JOB.20.16	He shall suck the poison of asps:
JOB.20.16	the viper's tongue shall slay him.
JOB.20.17	He shall not see the rivers,
JOB.20.17	the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
JOB.20.18	That which he labored for shall he restore,
JOB.20.18	and shall not swallow 
JOB.20.18	according to 
JOB.20.18	and he shall not rejoice 
JOB.20.19	Because he hath oppressed 
JOB.20.20	Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly,
JOB.20.20	he shall not save of that which he desired.
JOB.20.21	There shall none of his meat be left;
JOB.20.21	therefore shall no man look for his goods.
JOB.20.22	In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:
JOB.20.22	every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
JOB.20.23	and shall rain 
JOB.20.24	He shall flee from the iron weapon,
JOB.20.25	It is drawn, and cometh out of the body;
JOB.20.25	yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall:
JOB.20.25	terrors 
JOB.20.26	All darkness 
JOB.20.26	a fire not blown shall consume him;
JOB.20.26	it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
JOB.20.27	The heaven shall reveal his iniquity;
JOB.20.27	and the earth shall rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The increase of his house shall depart,
JOB.20.29	This 
JOB.20.29	and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
JOB.21.1	But Job answered and said,
JOB.21.2	Hear diligently my speech,
JOB.21.2	and let this be your consolations.
JOB.21.3	Suffer me that I may speak;
JOB.21.3	and after that I have spoken, mock on.
JOB.21.4	As for me, 
JOB.21.4	And if 
JOB.21.5	Mark me, and be astonished,
JOB.21.5	and lay 
JOB.21.6	Even when I remember I am afraid,
JOB.21.6	and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
JOB.21.7	Wherefore do the wicked live,
JOB.21.7	become old, yea, are mighty in power?
JOB.21.8	Their seed is established in their sight with them,
JOB.21.8	and their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their houses 
JOB.21.9	neither 
JOB.21.10	Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;
JOB.21.10	their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
JOB.21.11	They send forth their little ones like a flock,
JOB.21.11	and their children dance.
JOB.21.12	They take the timbrel and harp,
JOB.21.12	and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in wealth,
JOB.21.13	and in a moment go down to the grave.
JOB.21.14	Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us;
JOB.21.14	for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
JOB.21.15	What 
JOB.21.15	And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
JOB.21.16	Lo, their good 
JOB.21.16	the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.21.17	How oft is the candle of the wicked put out!
JOB.21.17	And 
JOB.21.18	They are as stubble before the wind,
JOB.21.18	and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
JOB.21.19	God layeth up his iniquity for his children:
JOB.21.19	he rewardeth him, and he shall know 
JOB.21.20	His eyes shall see his destruction,
JOB.21.20	and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For what pleasure 
JOB.21.21	when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
JOB.21.22	Shall 
JOB.21.22	seeing he judgeth those that are high.
JOB.21.23	One dieth in his full strength,
JOB.21.23	being wholly at ease and quiet.
JOB.21.24	His breasts are full of milk,
JOB.21.24	and his bones are moistened with marrow.
JOB.21.25	And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul,
JOB.21.25	and never eateth with pleasure.
JOB.21.26	They shall lie down alike in the dust,
JOB.21.26	and the worms shall cover them.
JOB.21.27	Behold, I know your thoughts,
JOB.21.27	and the devices 
JOB.21.28	For ye say, Where 
JOB.21.28	And where 
JOB.21.29	Have ye not asked them that go by the way?
JOB.21.29	And do ye not know their tokens,
JOB.21.30	that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction?
JOB.21.30	They shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
JOB.21.31	Who shall declare his way to his face?
JOB.21.31	And who shall repay him 
JOB.21.32	Yet shall he be brought to the grave,
JOB.21.32	and shall remain in the tomb.
JOB.21.33	The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,
JOB.21.33	and every man shall draw after him,
JOB.21.33	as 
JOB.21.34	How then comfort ye me in vain,
JOB.21.34	seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
JOB.22.1	Then El´iphaz the Te´manite answered and said,
JOB.22.2	as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
JOB.22.3	Or 
JOB.22.4	Will he reprove thee for fear of thee?
JOB.22.4	Will he enter with thee into judgment?
JOB.22.5	and thine iniquities infinite?
JOB.22.6	For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought,
JOB.22.6	and stripped the naked of their clothing.
JOB.22.7	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,
JOB.22.7	and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
JOB.22.8	But 
JOB.22.8	and the honorable man dwelt in it.
JOB.22.9	Thou hast sent widows away empty,
JOB.22.9	and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
JOB.22.10	Therefore snares 
JOB.22.10	and sudden fear troubleth thee;
JOB.22.11	or darkness, 
JOB.22.11	and abundance of waters cover thee.
JOB.22.12	And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
JOB.22.13	And thou sayest, How doth God know?
JOB.22.13	Can he judge through the dark cloud?
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds 
JOB.22.14	and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
JOB.22.15	Hast thou marked the old way
JOB.22.15	which wicked men have trodden?
JOB.22.16	which were cut down out of time,
JOB.22.16	whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
JOB.22.17	which said unto God, Depart from us:
JOB.22.17	and what can the Almighty do for them?
JOB.22.18	Yet he filled their houses with good 
JOB.22.18	but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.22.19	The righteous see 
JOB.22.19	and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
JOB.22.20	Whereas our substance is not cut down,
JOB.22.20	but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
JOB.22.21	Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace:
JOB.22.21	thereby good shall come unto thee.
JOB.22.22	Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,
JOB.22.22	and lay up his words in thine heart.
JOB.22.23	If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up,
JOB.22.23	thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
JOB.22.24	Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust,
JOB.22.24	and the 
JOB.22.25	Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense,
JOB.22.25	and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
JOB.22.26	For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty,
JOB.22.26	and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
JOB.22.27	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,
JOB.22.27	and thou shalt pay thy vows.
JOB.22.28	Thou shalt also decree a thing,
JOB.22.28	and it shall be established unto thee:
JOB.22.28	and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
JOB.22.29	When 
JOB.22.29	then thou shalt say, 
JOB.22.29	and he shall save the humble person.
JOB.22.30	He shall deliver the island of the innocent:
JOB.22.30	and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.23.2	Even today 
JOB.23.2	my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
JOB.23.3	Oh that I knew where I might find him!
JOB.23.4	I would order 
JOB.23.4	and fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would know the words 
JOB.23.5	and understand what he would say unto me.
JOB.23.6	Will he plead against me with 
JOB.23.6	No; but he would put 
JOB.23.7	There the righteous might dispute with him;
JOB.23.7	so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
JOB.23.8	Behold, I go forward, but he 
JOB.23.8	and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
JOB.23.9	on the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold 
JOB.23.9	he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see 
JOB.23.10	but he knoweth the way that I take:
JOB.23.11	My foot hath held his steps,
JOB.23.11	his way have I kept, and not declined.
JOB.23.12	Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips;
JOB.23.12	I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary 
JOB.23.13	But he 
JOB.23.13	And 
JOB.23.14	For he performeth 
JOB.23.14	and many such 
JOB.23.15	Therefore am I troubled at his presence:
JOB.23.15	when I consider, I am afraid of him.
JOB.23.16	For God maketh my heart soft,
JOB.23.16	and the Almighty troubleth me:
JOB.23.17	because I was not cut off before the darkness,
JOB.24.1	Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty,
JOB.24.1	do they that know him not see his days?
JOB.24.2	they violently take away flocks, and feed 
JOB.24.3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless,
JOB.24.3	they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
JOB.24.4	They turn the needy out of the way:
JOB.24.4	the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
JOB.24.5	Behold, 
JOB.24.5	go they forth to their work;
JOB.24.5	rising betimes for a prey:
JOB.24.5	the wilderness 
JOB.24.6	They reap 
JOB.24.6	and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing,
JOB.24.7	that 
JOB.24.8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
JOB.24.8	and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
JOB.24.9	They pluck the fatherless from the breast,
JOB.24.9	and take a pledge of the poor.
JOB.24.10	They cause 
JOB.24.10	and they take away the sheaf 
JOB.24.12	Men groan from out of the city,
JOB.24.12	and the soul of the wounded crieth out:
JOB.24.12	yet God layeth not folly 
JOB.24.13	They are of those that rebel against the light;
JOB.24.13	they know not the ways thereof,
JOB.24.13	nor abide in the paths thereof.
JOB.24.14	The murderer rising with the light
JOB.24.14	killeth the poor and needy,
JOB.24.14	and in the night is as a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
JOB.24.15	saying, No eye shall see me:
JOB.24.15	and disguiseth 
JOB.24.16	In the dark they dig through houses,
JOB.24.16	they know not the light.
JOB.24.17	For the morning 
JOB.24.17	if 
JOB.24.18	He 
JOB.24.18	their portion is cursed in the earth:
JOB.24.18	he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
JOB.24.19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters:
JOB.24.20	The womb shall forget him;
JOB.24.20	the worm shall feed sweetly on him;
JOB.24.20	he shall be no more remembered;
JOB.24.20	and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
JOB.24.21	He evil entreateth the barren 
JOB.24.21	and doeth not good to the widow.
JOB.24.22	He draweth also the mighty with his power:
JOB.24.22	he riseth up, and no 
JOB.24.23	yet his eyes 
JOB.24.24	They are exalted for a little while,
JOB.24.24	but are gone and brought low;
JOB.24.24	they are taken out of the way as all 
JOB.24.24	and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
JOB.24.25	And if 
JOB.24.25	and make my speech nothing worth?
JOB.25.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
JOB.25.2	Dominion and fear 
JOB.25.2	he maketh peace in his high places.
JOB.25.3	Is there any number of his armies?
JOB.25.3	And upon whom doth not his light arise?
JOB.25.4	How then can man be justified with God?
JOB.25.4	Or how can he be clean 
JOB.25.5	Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not;
JOB.25.5	yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.
JOB.25.6	How much less man, 
JOB.25.6	and the son of man, 
JOB.26.1	But Job answered and said,
JOB.26.2	How hast thou helped 
JOB.26.3	How hast thou counseled 
JOB.26.3	And 
JOB.26.4	To whom hast thou uttered words?
JOB.26.4	And whose spirit came from thee?
JOB.26.5	Dead 
JOB.26.5	and the inhabitants thereof.
JOB.26.6	Hell
JOB.26.6	and destruction hath no covering.
JOB.26.7	He stretcheth out the north over the empty place,
JOB.26.8	He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;
JOB.26.8	and the cloud is not rent under them.
JOB.26.9	He holdeth back the face of his throne,
JOB.26.10	He hath compassed the waters with bounds,
JOB.26.10	until the day and night come to an end.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of heaven tremble,
JOB.26.11	and are astonished at his reproof.
JOB.26.12	He divideth the sea with his power,
JOB.26.12	and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
JOB.26.13	By his Spirit he hath garnished the heavens;
JOB.26.13	his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
JOB.26.14	Lo, these 
JOB.26.14	but how little a portion is heard of him?
JOB.26.14	But the thunder of his power who can understand?
JOB.27.1	Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
JOB.27.2	and the Almighty, 
JOB.27.3	all the while my breath 
JOB.27.3	and the spirit of God 
JOB.27.4	my lips shall not speak wickedness,
JOB.27.4	nor my tongue utter deceit.
JOB.27.5	God forbid that I should justify you:
JOB.27.5	till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
JOB.27.6	My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go:
JOB.27.6	my heart shall not reproach 
JOB.27.7	Let mine enemy be as the wicked,
JOB.27.7	and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
JOB.27.8	For what 
JOB.27.8	when God taketh away his soul?
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry
JOB.27.9	when trouble cometh upon him?
JOB.27.10	Will he delight himself in the Almighty?
JOB.27.10	Will he always call upon God?
JOB.27.11	I will teach you by the hand of God:
JOB.27.12	Behold, all ye yourselves have seen 
JOB.27.12	why then are ye thus altogether vain?
JOB.27.13	This 
JOB.27.13	and the heritage of oppressors, 
JOB.27.14	If his children be multiplied, 
JOB.27.14	and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
JOB.27.15	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death:
JOB.27.15	and his widows shall not weep.
JOB.27.16	Though he heap up silver as the dust,
JOB.27.16	and prepare raiment as the clay;
JOB.27.17	he may prepare 
JOB.27.17	and the innocent shall divide the silver.
JOB.27.18	He buildeth his house as a moth,
JOB.27.18	and as a booth 
JOB.27.19	The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered:
JOB.27.19	he openeth his eyes, and he 
JOB.27.20	Terrors take hold on him as waters,
JOB.27.20	a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth:
JOB.27.21	and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
JOB.27.22	For 
JOB.27.22	he would fain flee out of his hand.
JOB.27.23	and shall hiss him out of his place.
JOB.28.1	Surely there is a vein for the silver,
JOB.28.1	and a place for gold 
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken out of the earth,
JOB.28.2	and brass 
JOB.28.3	He setteth an end to darkness,
JOB.28.3	and searcheth out all perfection:
JOB.28.3	the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
JOB.28.4	The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant;
JOB.28.4	they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
JOB.28.5	and under it is turned up as it were fire.
JOB.28.6	The stones of it 
JOB.28.6	and it hath dust of gold.
JOB.28.7	and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:
JOB.28.8	the lion's whelps have not trodden it,
JOB.28.8	nor the fierce lion passed by it.
JOB.28.9	He putteth forth his hand upon the rock;
JOB.28.9	he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
JOB.28.10	He cutteth out rivers among the rocks;
JOB.28.10	and his eye seeth every precious thing.
JOB.28.11	He bindeth the floods from overflowing;
JOB.28.11	and 
JOB.28.12	But where shall wisdom be found?
JOB.28.12	And where 
JOB.28.13	Man knoweth not the price thereof;
JOB.28.13	neither is it found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The depth saith, It 
JOB.28.14	and the sea saith, 
JOB.28.15	It cannot be gotten for gold,
JOB.28.15	neither shall silver be weighed 
JOB.28.16	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,
JOB.28.16	with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
JOB.28.17	The gold and the crystal cannot equal it:
JOB.28.17	and the exchange of it 
JOB.28.18	No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls:
JOB.28.18	for the price of wisdom 
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,
JOB.28.19	neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
JOB.28.20	Whence then cometh wisdom?
JOB.28.20	And where 
JOB.28.21	seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
JOB.28.21	and kept close from the fowls of the air.
JOB.28.22	Destruction
JOB.28.22	We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
JOB.28.23	God understandeth the way thereof,
JOB.28.23	and he knoweth the place thereof.
JOB.28.24	For he looketh to the ends of the earth,
JOB.28.25	to make the weight for the winds;
JOB.28.25	and he weigheth the waters by measure.
JOB.28.26	When he made a decree for the rain,
JOB.28.26	and a way for the lightning of the thunder;
JOB.28.27	then did he see it, and declare it;
JOB.28.27	he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
JOB.28.28	Behold, the fear of the Lord, that 
JOB.28.28	and to depart from evil 
JOB.29.1	Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
JOB.29.2	Oh that I were as 
JOB.29.2	as 
JOB.29.3	when his candle shined upon my head,
JOB.29.4	as I was in the days of my youth,
JOB.29.4	when the secret of God 
JOB.29.5	when the Almighty 
JOB.29.6	when I washed my steps with butter,
JOB.29.6	and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
JOB.29.7	when I went out to the gate through the city,
JOB.29.8	The young men saw me, and hid themselves:
JOB.29.8	and the aged arose, 
JOB.29.9	The princes refrained talking,
JOB.29.9	and laid 
JOB.29.10	The nobles held their peace,
JOB.29.10	and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
JOB.29.11	When the ear heard 
JOB.29.11	and when the eye saw 
JOB.29.12	because I delivered the poor that cried,
JOB.29.12	and the fatherless, and 
JOB.29.13	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me:
JOB.29.13	and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:
JOB.29.14	my judgment 
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind,
JOB.29.15	and feet 
JOB.29.16	I 
JOB.29.16	and the cause 
JOB.29.17	And I brake the jaws of the wicked,
JOB.29.17	and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
JOB.29.18	Then I said, I shall die in my nest,
JOB.29.18	and I shall multiply 
JOB.29.19	My root 
JOB.29.19	and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
JOB.29.20	My glory 
JOB.29.20	and my bow was renewed in my hand.
JOB.29.21	Unto me 
JOB.29.21	and kept silence at my counsel.
JOB.29.22	After my words they spake not again;
JOB.29.22	and my speech dropped upon them.
JOB.29.23	And they waited for me as for the rain;
JOB.29.23	and they opened their mouth wide 
JOB.29.24	and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
JOB.29.25	I chose out their way, and sat chief,
JOB.29.25	and dwelt as a king in the army,
JOB.29.25	as one 
JOB.30.1	But now 
JOB.30.1	whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
JOB.30.2	Yea, whereto 
JOB.30.2	in whom old age was perished?
JOB.30.3	For want and famine 
JOB.30.3	fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste:
JOB.30.4	who cut up mallows by the bushes,
JOB.30.4	and juniper roots 
JOB.30.5	They were driven forth from among 
JOB.30.5	(they cried after them as 
JOB.30.6	to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys,
JOB.30.7	Among the bushes they brayed;
JOB.30.7	under the nettles they were gathered together.
JOB.30.8	they were viler than the earth.
JOB.30.9	And now am I their song,
JOB.30.9	yea, I am their byword.
JOB.30.10	They abhor me, they flee far from me,
JOB.30.10	and spare not to spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me,
JOB.30.11	they have also let loose the bridle before me.
JOB.30.12	Upon 
JOB.30.12	they push away my feet,
JOB.30.12	and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
JOB.30.13	They mar my path,
JOB.30.13	they set forward my calamity,
JOB.30.13	they have no helper.
JOB.30.14	They came 
JOB.30.14	in the desolation they rolled themselves 
JOB.30.15	Terrors are turned upon me:
JOB.30.15	they pursue my soul as the wind:
JOB.30.15	and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
JOB.30.16	And now my soul is poured out upon me;
JOB.30.16	the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
JOB.30.17	My bones are pierced in me in the night season:
JOB.30.17	and my sinews take no rest.
JOB.30.18	By the great force 
JOB.30.18	it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
JOB.30.19	He hath cast me into the mire,
JOB.30.19	and I am become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me:
JOB.30.20	I stand up, and thou regardest me 
JOB.30.21	Thou art become cruel to me:
JOB.30.21	with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
JOB.30.22	Thou liftest me up to the wind;
JOB.30.22	thou causest me to ride 
JOB.30.22	and dissolvest my substance.
JOB.30.23	For I know 
JOB.30.23	and 
JOB.30.24	Howbeit he will not stretch out 
JOB.30.24	though they cry in his destruction.
JOB.30.25	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
JOB.30.25	Was 
JOB.30.26	When I looked for good, then evil came 
JOB.30.26	and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
JOB.30.27	My bowels boiled, and rested not:
JOB.30.27	the days of affliction prevented me.
JOB.30.28	I went mourning without the sun:
JOB.30.28	I stood up, 
JOB.30.29	I am a brother to dragons,
JOB.30.29	and a companion to owls.
JOB.30.30	My skin is black upon me,
JOB.30.30	and my bones are burned with heat.
JOB.30.31	My harp also is 
JOB.30.31	and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
JOB.31.1	I made a covenant with mine eyes;
JOB.31.1	why then should I think upon a maid?
JOB.31.2	For what portion of God 
JOB.31.2	and 
JOB.31.3	and a strange 
JOB.31.4	Doth not he see my ways,
JOB.31.4	and count all my steps?
JOB.31.5	If I have walked with vanity,
JOB.31.5	or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
JOB.31.6	let me be weighed in an even balance,
JOB.31.6	that God may know mine integrity.
JOB.31.7	If my step hath turned out of the way,
JOB.31.7	and mine heart walked after mine eyes,
JOB.31.7	and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
JOB.31.8	yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
JOB.31.9	If mine heart have been deceived by a woman,
JOB.31.9	or 
JOB.31.10	and let others bow down upon her.
JOB.31.11	For this 
JOB.31.11	yea, it 
JOB.31.12	For it 
JOB.31.12	and would root out all mine increase.
JOB.31.13	If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant,
JOB.31.13	when they contended with me;
JOB.31.14	what then shall I do when God riseth up?
JOB.31.14	And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
JOB.31.15	Did not he that made me in the womb make him?
JOB.31.15	And did not one fashion us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	If I have withheld the poor from 
JOB.31.16	or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
JOB.31.17	or have eaten my morsel myself alone,
JOB.31.17	and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
JOB.31.18	(for from my youth he was brought up with me, as 
JOB.31.18	and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
JOB.31.19	if I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
JOB.31.19	or any poor without covering;
JOB.31.20	if his loins have not blessed me,
JOB.31.20	and 
JOB.31.21	if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
JOB.31.21	when I saw my help in the gate:
JOB.31.22	and mine arm be broken from the bone.
JOB.31.23	For destruction 
JOB.31.23	and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
JOB.31.24	If I have made gold my hope,
JOB.31.24	or have said to the fine gold, 
JOB.31.25	if I rejoiced because my wealth 
JOB.31.25	and because mine hand had gotten much;
JOB.31.26	if I beheld the sun when it shined,
JOB.31.26	or the moon walking 
JOB.31.27	and my heart hath been secretly enticed,
JOB.31.27	or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
JOB.31.28	this also 
JOB.31.28	for I should have denied the God 
JOB.31.29	If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,
JOB.31.29	or lifted up myself when evil found him;
JOB.31.30	(neither have I suffered my mouth to sin
JOB.31.30	by wishing a curse to his soul.)
JOB.31.31	If the men of my tabernacle said not,
JOB.31.31	Oh that we had of his flesh! We cannot be satisfied.
JOB.31.32	The stranger did not lodge in the street:
JOB.31.33	If I covered my transgressions as Adam,
JOB.31.33	by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
JOB.31.34	did I fear a great multitude,
JOB.31.34	or did the contempt of families terrify me,
JOB.31.34	that I kept silence, 
JOB.31.35	Oh that one would hear me!
JOB.31.35	Behold, my desire 
JOB.31.35	and 
JOB.31.36	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder,
JOB.31.37	I would declare unto him the number of my steps;
JOB.31.37	as a prince would I go near unto him.
JOB.31.38	If my land cry against me,
JOB.31.38	or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
JOB.31.39	if I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,
JOB.31.39	or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
JOB.31.40	let thistles grow instead of wheat,
JOB.31.40	and cockle instead of barley.
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he 
JOB.32.2	Then was kindled the wrath of Eli´hu the son of Bar´achel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 
JOB.32.3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and 
JOB.32.4	Now Eli´hu had waited till Job had spoken, because they 
JOB.32.5	When Eli´hu saw that 
JOB.32.6	And Eli´hu the son of Bar´achel the Buzite answered and said,
JOB.32.6	I 
JOB.32.6	and ye 
JOB.32.6	wherefore I was afraid,
JOB.32.6	and durst not show you mine opinion.
JOB.32.7	I said, Days should speak,
JOB.32.7	and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
JOB.32.8	But 
JOB.32.8	and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
JOB.32.9	Great men are not 
JOB.32.9	neither do the aged understand judgment.
JOB.32.10	Therefore I said, Hearken to me;
JOB.32.10	I also will show mine opinion.
JOB.32.11	Behold, I waited for your words;
JOB.32.11	I gave ear to your reasons,
JOB.32.11	whilst ye searched out what to say.
JOB.32.12	Yea, I attended unto you,
JOB.32.12	and, behold, 
JOB.32.13	lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom:
JOB.32.13	God thrusteth him down, not man.
JOB.32.14	Now he hath not directed 
JOB.32.14	neither will I answer him with your speeches.
JOB.32.15	They were amazed, they answered no more:
JOB.32.15	they left off speaking.
JOB.32.16	When I had waited, (for they spake not,
JOB.32.16	but stood still, 
JOB.32.17	I also will show mine opinion.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of matter;
JOB.32.18	the spirit within me constraineth me.
JOB.32.19	Behold, my belly 
JOB.32.19	it is ready to burst like new bottles.
JOB.32.20	I will speak, that I may be refreshed:
JOB.32.20	I will open my lips and answer.
JOB.32.21	Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person;
JOB.32.21	neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
JOB.32.22	For I know not to give flattering titles;
JOB.33.1	Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches,
JOB.33.1	and hearken to all my words.
JOB.33.2	Behold, now I have opened my mouth,
JOB.33.2	my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
JOB.33.3	My words 
JOB.33.3	and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God hath made me,
JOB.33.4	and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
JOB.33.5	If thou canst answer me,
JOB.33.5	set 
JOB.33.6	Behold, I 
JOB.33.6	I also am formed out of the clay.
JOB.33.7	Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid,
JOB.33.7	neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
JOB.33.8	Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing,
JOB.33.8	and I have heard the voice of 
JOB.33.9	I am clean without transgression,
JOB.33.9	I 
JOB.33.10	Behold, he findeth occasions against me,
JOB.33.10	he counteth me for his enemy;
JOB.33.11	he putteth my feet in the stocks,
JOB.33.11	he marketh all my paths.
JOB.33.12	Behold, 
JOB.33.12	I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
JOB.33.13	Why dost thou strive against him?
JOB.33.13	for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
JOB.33.14	For God speaketh once,
JOB.33.14	yea twice, 
JOB.33.15	In a dream, in a vision of the night,
JOB.33.15	when deep sleep falleth upon men,
JOB.33.15	in slumberings upon the bed;
JOB.33.16	then he openeth the ears of men,
JOB.33.16	and sealeth their instruction,
JOB.33.17	that he may withdraw man 
JOB.33.17	and hide pride from man.
JOB.33.18	He keepeth back his soul from the pit,
JOB.33.18	and his life from perishing by the sword.
JOB.33.19	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,
JOB.33.19	and the multitude of his bones with strong 
JOB.33.20	so that his life abhorreth bread,
JOB.33.20	and his soul dainty meat.
JOB.33.21	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;
JOB.33.21	and his bones 
JOB.33.22	Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave,
JOB.33.22	and his life to the destroyers.
JOB.33.23	If there be a messenger with him,
JOB.33.23	an interpreter, one among a thousand,
JOB.33.23	to show unto man his uprightness;
JOB.33.24	then he is gracious unto him, and saith,
JOB.33.24	Deliver him from going down to the pit:
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom.
JOB.33.25	His flesh shall be fresher than a child's:
JOB.33.25	he shall return to the days of his youth:
JOB.33.26	he shall pray unto God, and he will be favorable unto him:
JOB.33.26	and he shall see his face with joy:
JOB.33.26	for he will render unto man his righteousness.
JOB.33.27	He looketh upon men, and 
JOB.33.27	I have sinned, and perverted 
JOB.33.27	and it profited me not;
JOB.33.28	he will deliver his soul from going into the pit,
JOB.33.28	and his life shall see the light.
JOB.33.29	Lo, all these 
JOB.33.30	to bring back his soul from the pit,
JOB.33.30	to be enlightened with the light of the living.
JOB.33.31	Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me:
JOB.33.31	hold thy peace, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	If thou hast any thing to say, answer me:
JOB.33.32	speak, for I desire to justify thee.
JOB.33.33	If not, hearken unto me:
JOB.33.33	hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
JOB.34.1	Furthermore Eli´hu answered and said,
JOB.34.2	Hear my words, O ye wise 
JOB.34.2	and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
JOB.34.3	For the ear trieth words,
JOB.34.3	as the mouth tasteth meat.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose to us judgment:
JOB.34.4	let us know among ourselves what 
JOB.34.5	For Job hath said, I am righteous:
JOB.34.5	and God hath taken away my judgment.
JOB.34.6	Should I lie against my right?
JOB.34.6	My wound 
JOB.34.7	What man 
JOB.34.8	which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,
JOB.34.8	and walketh with wicked men.
JOB.34.9	For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing
JOB.34.9	that he should delight himself with God.
JOB.34.10	Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding:
JOB.34.10	far be it from God, 
JOB.34.10	and 
JOB.34.11	and cause every man to find according to 
JOB.34.12	Yea, surely God will not do wickedly,
JOB.34.12	neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
JOB.34.13	Who hath given him a charge over the earth?
JOB.34.13	Or who hath disposed the whole world?
JOB.34.14	If he set his heart upon man,
JOB.34.15	all flesh shall perish together,
JOB.34.15	and man shall turn again unto dust.
JOB.34.16	If now 
JOB.34.16	hearken to the voice of my words.
JOB.34.17	Shall even he that hateth right govern?
JOB.34.17	And wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
JOB.34.19	nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?
JOB.34.19	For they all 
JOB.34.20	In a moment shall they die,
JOB.34.20	and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away:
JOB.34.20	and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
JOB.34.21	For his eyes 
JOB.34.21	and he seeth all his goings.
JOB.34.22	where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
JOB.34.23	For he will not lay upon man more 
JOB.34.23	that he should enter into judgment with God.
JOB.34.24	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number,
JOB.34.24	and set others in their stead.
JOB.34.25	Therefore he knoweth their works,
JOB.34.25	and he overturneth 
JOB.34.26	He striketh them as wicked men
JOB.34.26	in the open sight of others;
JOB.34.27	because they turned back from him,
JOB.34.27	and would not consider any of his ways:
JOB.34.28	so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him,
JOB.34.28	and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
JOB.34.29	When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?
JOB.34.29	And when he hideth 
JOB.34.29	whether 
JOB.34.30	that the hypocrite reign not,
JOB.34.30	lest the people be ensnared.
JOB.34.31	Surely it is meet to be said unto God,
JOB.34.31	I have borne 
JOB.34.32	if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
JOB.34.33	whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I:
JOB.34.33	therefore speak what thou knowest.
JOB.34.34	Let men of understanding tell me,
JOB.34.34	and let a wise man hearken unto me.
JOB.34.35	Job hath spoken without knowledge,
JOB.34.35	and his words 
JOB.34.36	My desire 
JOB.34.36	because of 
JOB.34.37	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin,
JOB.34.37	he clappeth 
JOB.34.37	and multiplieth his words against God.
JOB.35.1	Eli´hu spake moreover, and said,
JOB.35.2	Thinkest thou this to be right,
JOB.35.3	For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee?
JOB.35.4	I will answer thee,
JOB.35.4	and thy companions with thee.
JOB.35.5	Look unto the heavens, and see;
JOB.35.5	and behold the clouds 
JOB.35.6	Or 
JOB.35.7	If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?
JOB.35.7	Or what receiveth he of thine hand?
JOB.35.8	Thy wickedness 
JOB.35.8	and thy righteousness 
JOB.35.9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make 
JOB.35.9	they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
JOB.35.10	But none saith, Where 
JOB.35.10	who giveth songs in the night;
JOB.35.11	who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,
JOB.35.11	and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
JOB.35.12	There they cry, but none giveth answer,
JOB.35.12	because of the pride of evil men.
JOB.35.13	Surely God will not hear vanity,
JOB.35.13	neither will the Almighty regard it.
JOB.35.14	Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him,
JOB.35.15	But now, because 
JOB.35.15	yet he knoweth 
JOB.35.16	therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain;
JOB.35.16	he multiplieth words without knowledge.
JOB.36.1	Eli´hu also proceeded, and said,
JOB.36.2	Suffer me a little, and I will show thee
JOB.36.2	that 
JOB.36.3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
JOB.36.3	and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	For truly my words 
JOB.36.4	he that is perfect in knowledge 
JOB.36.5	Behold, God 
JOB.36.6	He preserveth not the life of the wicked:
JOB.36.6	but giveth right to the poor.
JOB.36.7	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:
JOB.36.7	but with kings 
JOB.36.7	yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
JOB.36.8	And if 
JOB.36.9	then he showeth them their work,
JOB.36.9	and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
JOB.36.10	He openeth also their ear to discipline,
JOB.36.10	and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
JOB.36.11	If they obey and serve 
JOB.36.11	they shall spend their days in prosperity,
JOB.36.11	and their years in pleasures.
JOB.36.12	But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword,
JOB.36.12	and they shall die without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath:
JOB.36.13	they cry not when he bindeth them.
JOB.36.14	They die in youth,
JOB.36.14	and their life 
JOB.36.15	He delivereth the poor in his affliction,
JOB.36.15	and openeth their ears in oppression.
JOB.36.16	Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait
JOB.36.16	and that which should be set on thy table 
JOB.36.17	But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked:
JOB.36.17	judgment and justice take hold 
JOB.36.18	Because 
JOB.36.18	then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
JOB.36.19	Will he esteem thy riches?
JOB.36.19	nor all the forces of strength.
JOB.36.20	Desire not the night,
JOB.36.20	when people are cut off in their place.
JOB.36.21	Take heed, regard not iniquity:
JOB.36.21	for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
JOB.36.22	Behold, God exalteth by his power:
JOB.36.22	who teacheth like him?
JOB.36.23	Who hath enjoined him his way?
JOB.36.23	Or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
JOB.36.24	Remember that thou magnify his work,
JOB.36.24	which men behold.
JOB.36.25	Every man may see it;
JOB.36.25	man may behold 
JOB.36.26	Behold, God 
JOB.36.26	neither can the number of his years be searched out.
JOB.36.27	For he maketh small the drops of water:
JOB.36.27	they pour down rain according to the vapor thereof;
JOB.36.28	which the clouds do drop
JOB.36.29	Also can 
JOB.36.30	Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it,
JOB.36.30	and covereth the bottom of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For by them judgeth he the people;
JOB.36.31	he giveth meat in abundance.
JOB.36.32	With clouds he covereth the light;
JOB.36.32	and commandeth it 
JOB.36.33	The noise thereof showeth concerning it,
JOB.36.33	the cattle also concerning the vapor.
JOB.37.1	At this also my heart trembleth,
JOB.37.1	and is moved out of his place.
JOB.37.2	Hear attentively the noise of his voice,
JOB.37.2	and the sound 
JOB.37.3	He directeth it under the whole heaven,
JOB.37.3	and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After it a voice roareth:
JOB.37.4	he thundereth with the voice of his excellency;
JOB.37.4	and he will not stay them
JOB.37.4	when his voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God thundereth marvelously with his voice;
JOB.37.5	great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
JOB.37.6	For he saith to the snow, Be thou 
JOB.37.6	likewise to the small rain,
JOB.37.6	and to the great rain of his strength.
JOB.37.7	He sealeth up the hand of every man;
JOB.37.7	that all men may know his work.
JOB.37.8	Then the beasts go into dens,
JOB.37.8	and remain in their places.
JOB.37.9	Out of the south cometh the whirlwind:
JOB.37.9	and cold out of the north.
JOB.37.10	By the breath of God frost is given:
JOB.37.10	and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
JOB.37.11	Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud:
JOB.37.11	he scattereth his bright cloud:
JOB.37.12	and it is turned round about by his counsels:
JOB.37.12	that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them
JOB.37.12	upon the face of the world in the earth.
JOB.37.13	He causeth it to come, whether for correction,
JOB.37.13	or for his land, or for mercy.
JOB.37.14	Hearken unto this, O Job:
JOB.37.14	stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
JOB.37.15	Dost thou know when God disposed them,
JOB.37.15	and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
JOB.37.16	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,
JOB.37.16	the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
JOB.37.17	how thy garments 
JOB.37.17	when he quieteth the earth by the south 
JOB.37.18	Hast thou with him spread out the sky,
JOB.37.19	Teach us what we shall say unto him;
JOB.37.20	Shall it be told him that I speak?
JOB.37.20	If a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
JOB.37.21	And now 
JOB.37.21	but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
JOB.37.22	Fair weather cometh out of the north:
JOB.37.22	with God 
JOB.37.23	and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
JOB.37.24	Men do therefore fear him:
JOB.37.24	he respecteth not any 
JOB.38.1	Then the 
JOB.38.2	Who 
JOB.38.2	by words without knowledge?
JOB.38.3	Gird up now thy loins like a man;
JOB.38.3	for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
JOB.38.4	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
JOB.38.4	Declare, if thou hast understanding.
JOB.38.5	Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest?
JOB.38.5	Or who hath stretched the line upon it?
JOB.38.6	Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?
JOB.38.6	Or who laid the corner stone thereof;
JOB.38.7	when the morning stars sang together,
JOB.38.7	and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
JOB.38.8	when it brake forth, 
JOB.38.9	When I made the cloud the garment thereof,
JOB.38.9	and thick darkness a swaddling band for it,
JOB.38.10	and brake up for it my decreed 
JOB.38.10	and set bars and doors,
JOB.38.11	and said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further:
JOB.38.11	and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
JOB.38.12	Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;
JOB.38.13	that it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
JOB.38.13	that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
JOB.38.14	It is turned as clay 
JOB.38.14	and they stand as a garment.
JOB.38.15	And from the wicked their light is withholden,
JOB.38.15	and the high arm shall be broken.
JOB.38.16	Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?
JOB.38.16	Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?
JOB.38.17	Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
JOB.38.18	Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?
JOB.38.18	Declare if thou knowest it all.
JOB.38.19	Where 
JOB.38.19	And 
JOB.38.20	that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,
JOB.38.20	and that thou shouldest know the paths 
JOB.38.21	Knowest thou 
JOB.38.21	or 
JOB.38.22	Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?
JOB.38.22	Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
JOB.38.23	which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
JOB.38.23	against the day of battle and war?
JOB.38.24	By what way is the light parted,
JOB.38.25	Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
JOB.38.25	or a way for the lightning of thunder;
JOB.38.26	to cause it to rain on the earth, 
JOB.38.27	to satisfy the desolate and waste 
JOB.38.27	and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
JOB.38.28	Hath the rain a father?
JOB.38.28	Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	Out of whose womb came the ice?
JOB.38.29	And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
JOB.38.30	The waters are hid as 
JOB.38.30	and the face of the deep is frozen.
JOB.38.31	or loose the bands of Ori´on?
JOB.38.32	Canst thou bring forth Maz´zaroth in his season?
JOB.38.32	Or canst thou guide Arctu´rus with his sons?
JOB.38.33	Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven?
JOB.38.33	Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
JOB.38.34	Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
JOB.38.34	that abundance of waters may cover thee?
JOB.38.35	Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go,
JOB.38.35	and say unto thee, Here we 
JOB.38.36	Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?
JOB.38.36	Or who hath given understanding to the heart?
JOB.38.37	Who can number the clouds in wisdom?
JOB.38.37	Or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
JOB.38.38	when the dust groweth into hardness,
JOB.38.38	and the clods cleave fast together?
JOB.38.39	Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?
JOB.38.39	or fill the appetite of the young lions,
JOB.38.40	when they couch in 
JOB.38.41	Who provideth for the raven his food?
JOB.38.41	When his young ones cry unto God,
JOB.38.41	they wander for lack of meat.
JOB.39.1	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?
JOB.39.2	Canst thou number the months 
JOB.39.2	Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
JOB.39.3	They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones,
JOB.39.3	they cast out their sorrows.
JOB.39.4	Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;
JOB.39.4	they go forth, and return not unto them.
JOB.39.5	Who hath sent out the wild ass free?
JOB.39.5	Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
JOB.39.6	whose house I have made the wilderness,
JOB.39.6	and the barren land his dwellings.
JOB.39.7	He scorneth the multitude of the city,
JOB.39.7	neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
JOB.39.8	The range of the mountains 
JOB.39.8	and he searcheth after every green thing.
JOB.39.9	Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee,
JOB.39.9	or abide by thy crib?
JOB.39.10	Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow?
JOB.39.10	Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
JOB.39.11	Wilt thou trust him, because his strength 
JOB.39.11	Or wilt thou leave thy labor to him?
JOB.39.12	Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed,
JOB.39.12	and gather 
JOB.39.13	or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
JOB.39.14	which leaveth her eggs in the earth,
JOB.39.14	and warmeth them in the dust,
JOB.39.15	and forgetteth that the foot may crush them,
JOB.39.15	or that the wild beast may break them.
JOB.39.16	She is hardened against her young ones, as though 
JOB.39.16	her labor is in vain without fear;
JOB.39.17	because God hath deprived her of wisdom,
JOB.39.17	neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
JOB.39.18	What time she lifteth up herself on high,
JOB.39.18	she scorneth the horse and his rider.
JOB.39.19	Hast thou given the horse strength?
JOB.39.19	Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
JOB.39.20	Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?
JOB.39.20	The glory of his nostrils 
JOB.39.21	He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in 
JOB.39.21	he goeth on to meet the armed men.
JOB.39.22	He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted;
JOB.39.22	neither turneth he back from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The quiver rattleth against him,
JOB.39.23	the glittering spear and the shield.
JOB.39.24	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage:
JOB.39.24	neither believeth he that 
JOB.39.25	He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha!
JOB.39.25	And he smelleth the battle afar off,
JOB.39.25	the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
JOB.39.26	Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom,
JOB.39.27	Doth the eagle mount up at thy command,
JOB.39.27	and make her nest on high?
JOB.39.28	She dwelleth and abideth on the rock,
JOB.39.28	upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
JOB.39.29	From thence she seeketh the prey,
JOB.39.30	Her young ones also suck up blood:
JOB.39.30	and where the slain 
JOB.40.1	Moreover the 
JOB.40.2	Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct 
JOB.40.2	He that reproveth God, let him answer it.
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the 
JOB.40.4	Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?
JOB.40.4	I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
JOB.40.5	Once have I spoken; but I will not answer:
JOB.40.5	yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
JOB.40.6	Then answered the 
JOB.40.7	Gird up thy loins now like a man:
JOB.40.7	I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
JOB.40.8	Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?
JOB.40.8	Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
JOB.40.9	Hast thou an arm like God?
JOB.40.9	Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
JOB.40.10	Deck thyself now 
JOB.40.10	and array thyself with glory and beauty.
JOB.40.11	Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath:
JOB.40.11	and behold every one 
JOB.40.12	Look on every one 
JOB.40.12	and tread down the wicked in their place.
JOB.40.13	Hide them in the dust together;
JOB.40.14	Then will I also confess unto thee
JOB.40.14	that thine own right hand can save thee.
JOB.40.15	Behold now behemoth,
JOB.40.15	he eateth grass as an ox.
JOB.40.16	Lo now, his strength 
JOB.40.16	and his force 
JOB.40.17	He moveth his tail like a cedar:
JOB.40.17	the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
JOB.40.18	His bones 
JOB.40.18	his bones 
JOB.40.19	He 
JOB.40.19	he that made him can make his sword to approach 
JOB.40.20	Surely the mountains bring him forth food,
JOB.40.20	where all the beasts of the field play.
JOB.40.21	He lieth under the shady trees,
JOB.40.21	in the covert of the reed, and fens.
JOB.40.22	The shady trees cover him 
JOB.40.22	the willows of the brook compass him about.
JOB.40.23	Behold, he drinketh up a river, 
JOB.40.23	he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
JOB.40.24	He taketh it with his eyes:
JOB.41.1	or his tongue with a cord 
JOB.41.2	Canst thou put a hook into his nose?
JOB.41.2	or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
JOB.41.3	Will he make many supplications unto thee?
JOB.41.3	Will he speak soft 
JOB.41.4	Will he make a covenant with thee?
JOB.41.4	Wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
JOB.41.5	Wilt thou play with him as 
JOB.41.5	Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
JOB.41.6	Shall the companions make a banquet of him?
JOB.41.6	Shall they part him among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
JOB.41.7	or his head with fish spears?
JOB.41.8	Lay thine hand upon him,
JOB.41.8	remember the battle, do no more.
JOB.41.9	Behold, the hope of him is in vain:
JOB.41.9	shall not 
JOB.41.10	None 
JOB.41.10	who then is able to stand before me?
JOB.41.12	I will not conceal his parts,
JOB.41.12	nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
JOB.41.13	Who can discover the face of his garment?
JOB.41.14	Who can open the doors of his face?
JOB.41.14	His teeth 
JOB.41.15	shut up together 
JOB.41.16	One is so near to another,
JOB.41.16	that no air can come between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined one to another,
JOB.41.17	they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
JOB.41.18	By his sneezings a light doth shine,
JOB.41.18	and his eyes 
JOB.41.19	Out of his mouth go burning lamps,
JOB.41.20	Out of his nostrils goeth smoke,
JOB.41.20	as 
JOB.41.21	His breath kindleth coals,
JOB.41.21	and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
JOB.41.22	In his neck remaineth strength,
JOB.41.22	and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
JOB.41.23	The flakes of his flesh are joined together:
JOB.41.23	they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
JOB.41.24	His heart is as firm as a stone;
JOB.41.24	yea, as hard as a piece of the nether 
JOB.41.25	When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid:
JOB.41.25	by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
JOB.41.26	The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold:
JOB.41.26	the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
JOB.41.27	He esteemeth iron as straw,
JOB.41.28	The arrow cannot make him flee:
JOB.41.28	sling stones are turned with him into stubble.
JOB.41.29	Darts are counted as stubble:
JOB.41.29	he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
JOB.41.30	Sharp stones 
JOB.41.30	he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
JOB.41.31	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
JOB.41.31	he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
JOB.41.32	He maketh a path to shine after him;
JOB.41.33	Upon earth there is not his like,
JOB.41.33	who is made without fear.
JOB.41.34	He beholdeth all high 
JOB.41.34	he 
JOB.42.1	Then Job answered the 
JOB.42.2	I know that thou canst do every 
JOB.42.2	and 
JOB.42.3	Therefore have I uttered that I understood not;
JOB.42.3	things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
JOB.42.4	I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
JOB.42.5	I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear;
JOB.42.5	but now mine eye seeth thee:
JOB.42.6	wherefore I abhor 
JOB.42.6	and repent in dust and ashes.
JOB.42.7	And it was 
JOB.42.8	Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you 
JOB.42.9	So El´iphaz the Te´manite and Bildad the Shuhite 
JOB.42.11	Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the 
JOB.42.12	So the 
JOB.42.13	He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	And he called the name of the first, Jemi´ma; and the name of the second, Kezi´a; and the name of the third, Keren–hap´puch. 
JOB.42.15	And in all the land were no women found 
JOB.42.16	After this lived Job a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, 
JOB.42.17	So Job died, 
PSA.1.1	Blessed 
PSA.1.1	nor standeth in the way of sinners,
PSA.1.1	nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
PSA.1.2	But his delight 
PSA.1.2	and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
PSA.1.3	that bringeth forth his fruit in his season;
PSA.1.3	his leaf also shall not wither;
PSA.1.3	and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
PSA.1.4	The ungodly 
PSA.1.4	but 
PSA.1.5	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
PSA.1.5	nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
PSA.1.6	For the 
PSA.1.6	but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
PSA.2.1	and the people imagine a vain thing?
PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth set themselves,
PSA.2.2	and the rulers take counsel together,
PSA.2.2	against the 
PSA.2.3	Let us break their bands asunder,
PSA.2.3	and cast away their cords from us.
PSA.2.4	He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:
PSA.2.4	the Lord shall have them in derision.
PSA.2.5	Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath,
PSA.2.5	and vex them in his sore displeasure.
PSA.2.6	Yet have I set my King
PSA.2.6	upon my holy hill of Zion.
PSA.2.7	the 
PSA.2.7	this day have I begotten thee.
PSA.2.8	Ask of me,
PSA.2.8	and I shall give 
PSA.2.8	and the uttermost parts of the earth 
PSA.2.9	thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
PSA.2.10	Be wise now therefore, O ye kings:
PSA.2.10	be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
PSA.2.11	Serve the 
PSA.2.11	and rejoice with trembling.
PSA.2.12	Kiss the Son, lest he be angry,
PSA.2.12	and ye perish 
PSA.2.12	when his wrath is kindled but a little.
PSA.2.12	Blessed 
PSA.3.1	Many 
PSA.3.2	Many 
PSA.3.3	But thou, O 
PSA.3.3	my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
PSA.3.4	I cried unto the 
PSA.3.4	and he heard me out of his holy hill. 
PSA.3.5	I laid me down and slept;
PSA.3.5	I awaked; for the 
PSA.3.6	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,
PSA.3.6	that have set 
PSA.3.7	Arise, O 
PSA.3.7	save me, O my God:

PSA.4.2	O ye sons of men,
PSA.4.2	how long 
PSA.4.3	But know that the 
PSA.4.3	the 
PSA.4.4	commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. 
PSA.4.5	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,
PSA.4.5	and put your trust in the 
PSA.4.7	Thou hast put gladness in my heart,
PSA.4.7	more than in the time 
PSA.4.8	I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep:
PSA.4.8	for thou, 
PSA.5.1	Give ear to my words, O 
PSA.5.1	consider my meditation.
PSA.5.2	Hearken unto the voice of my cry,

PSA.5.3	in the morning will I direct 
PSA.5.3	and will look up.
PSA.5.4	For thou 
PSA.5.4	neither shall evil dwell with thee.
PSA.5.5	The foolish shall not stand in thy sight:
PSA.5.5	thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
PSA.5.6	Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing:
PSA.5.6	the 
PSA.5.7	But as for me, I will come 
PSA.5.8	Lead me, O 
PSA.5.8	make thy way straight before my face.
PSA.5.9	their inward part 
PSA.5.9	their throat 
PSA.5.9	they flatter with their tongue.
PSA.5.10	Destroy thou them, O God;
PSA.5.10	let them fall by their own counsels;
PSA.5.10	cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions;
PSA.5.10	for they have rebelled against thee.
PSA.5.11	But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice:
PSA.5.11	let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them:
PSA.5.11	let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
PSA.5.12	For thou, 
PSA.5.12	with favor wilt thou compass him as 
PSA.6.1	neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
PSA.6.2	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.6.2	O 
PSA.6.3	My soul is also sore vexed:
PSA.6.3	but thou, O 
PSA.6.4	Return, O 
PSA.6.4	oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
PSA.6.5	For in death 
PSA.6.5	in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
PSA.6.6	I am weary with my groaning;
PSA.6.6	all the night make I my bed to swim;
PSA.6.6	I water my couch with my tears.
PSA.6.7	Mine eye is consumed because of grief;
PSA.6.7	it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
PSA.6.8	for the 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.9	the 
PSA.6.10	Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed:
PSA.6.10	let them return 
PSA.7.1	O 
PSA.7.1	save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
PSA.7.2	lest he tear my soul like a lion,
PSA.7.2	rending 
PSA.7.3	O 
PSA.7.3	if there be iniquity in my hands;
PSA.7.4	if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
PSA.7.4	(yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy;)
PSA.7.5	let the enemy persecute my soul, and take 
PSA.7.5	yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth,
PSA.7.5	and lay mine honor in the dust. 
PSA.7.6	Arise, O 
PSA.7.6	lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies:
PSA.7.6	and awake for me 
PSA.7.7	So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
PSA.7.7	for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
PSA.7.8	The 
PSA.7.8	judge me, O 
PSA.7.8	and according to mine integrity 
PSA.7.9	but establish the just:
PSA.7.9	for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
PSA.7.10	My defense 
PSA.7.10	which saveth the upright in heart.
PSA.7.11	God judgeth the righteous,
PSA.7.11	and God is angry 
PSA.7.12	If he turn not, he will whet his sword;
PSA.7.12	he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
PSA.7.13	He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death;
PSA.7.13	he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
PSA.7.14	Behold, he travaileth with iniquity,
PSA.7.14	and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
PSA.7.15	He made a pit, and digged it,
PSA.7.15	and is fallen into the ditch 
PSA.7.16	His mischief shall return upon his own head,
PSA.7.16	and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
PSA.7.17	I will praise the 
PSA.7.17	and will sing praise to the name of the 
PSA.8.1	O 
PSA.8.1	how excellent 
PSA.8.1	who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
PSA.8.2	because of thine enemies,
PSA.8.2	that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.8.3	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
PSA.8.3	the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
PSA.8.4	and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
PSA.8.5	For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,
PSA.8.5	and hast crowned him with glory and honor.
PSA.8.6	thou hast put all 
PSA.8.7	all sheep and oxen,
PSA.8.7	yea, and the beasts of the field;
PSA.8.8	the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea,
PSA.8.9	O 
PSA.8.9	how excellent 
PSA.9.1	I will praise 
PSA.9.1	I will show forth all thy marvelous works.
PSA.9.2	I will be glad and rejoice in thee:
PSA.9.2	I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.
PSA.9.3	When mine enemies are turned back,
PSA.9.3	they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
PSA.9.4	For thou hast maintained my right and my cause;
PSA.9.4	thou satest in the throne judging right.
PSA.9.5	Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
PSA.9.5	thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
PSA.9.6	O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end:
PSA.9.6	and thou hast destroyed cities;
PSA.9.6	their memorial is perished with them.
PSA.9.7	But the 
PSA.9.7	he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
PSA.9.8	And he shall judge the world in righteousness,
PSA.9.8	he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
PSA.9.9	The 
PSA.9.9	a refuge in times of trouble.
PSA.9.10	And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee:
PSA.9.10	for thou, 
PSA.9.11	Sing praises to the 
PSA.9.11	declare among the people his doings.
PSA.9.12	When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them:
PSA.9.12	he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
PSA.9.13	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.9.13	consider my trouble 
PSA.9.13	thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
PSA.9.14	that I may show forth all thy praise
PSA.9.14	in the gates of the daughter of Zion:
PSA.9.14	I will rejoice in thy salvation.
PSA.9.15	The heathen are sunk down in the pit 
PSA.9.15	in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
PSA.9.16	The 
PSA.9.16	the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. 
PSA.9.17	The wicked shall be turned into hell,
PSA.9.18	For the needy shall not always be forgotten:
PSA.9.18	the expectation of the poor shall 
PSA.9.19	Arise, O 
PSA.9.19	let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
PSA.9.20	Put them in fear, O 
PSA.10.1	Why standest thou afar off, O 
PSA.10.2	The wicked in 
PSA.10.2	let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
PSA.10.3	For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire,
PSA.10.3	and blesseth the covetous, 
PSA.10.4	The wicked, through the pride of his countenance,
PSA.10.4	will not seek 
PSA.10.4	God 
PSA.10.5	His ways are always grievous;
PSA.10.5	thy judgments 
PSA.10.6	He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved:
PSA.10.6	for 
PSA.10.7	under his tongue 
PSA.10.8	He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages:
PSA.10.8	in the secret places doth he murder the innocent:
PSA.10.8	his eyes are privily set against the poor.
PSA.10.9	He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den:
PSA.10.9	he lieth in wait to catch the poor:
PSA.10.9	he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
PSA.10.10	He croucheth, 
PSA.10.10	that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
PSA.10.11	He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten:
PSA.10.11	he hideth his face; he will never see 
PSA.10.12	Arise, O 
PSA.10.12	forget not the humble.
PSA.10.13	Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God?
PSA.10.13	He hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require 
PSA.10.14	Thou hast seen 
PSA.10.14	to requite 
PSA.10.14	the poor committeth himself unto thee;
PSA.10.14	thou art the helper of the fatherless.
PSA.10.15	Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil 
PSA.10.15	seek out his wickedness 
PSA.10.16	The 
PSA.10.16	the heathen are perished out of his land.
PSA.10.17	thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
PSA.10.18	to judge the fatherless and the oppressed,
PSA.10.18	that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
PSA.11.1	In the 
PSA.11.1	how say ye to my soul,
PSA.11.1	Flee 
PSA.11.2	For, lo, the wicked bend 
PSA.11.2	they make ready their arrow upon the string,
PSA.11.2	that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
PSA.11.3	If the foundations be destroyed,
PSA.11.3	what can the righteous do?
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.4	the 
PSA.11.4	his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.5	but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
PSA.11.6	Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone,
PSA.11.6	and a horrible tempest: 
PSA.11.7	For the righteous 
PSA.11.7	his countenance doth behold the upright.
PSA.12.1	Help, 
PSA.12.1	for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
PSA.12.2	They speak vanity every one with his neighbor:
PSA.12.3	The 
PSA.12.4	who have said, With our tongue will we prevail;
PSA.12.4	our lips 
PSA.12.5	For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,
PSA.12.5	now will I arise, saith the 
PSA.12.5	I will set 
PSA.12.6	The words of the 
PSA.12.7	Thou shalt keep them, O 
PSA.12.7	thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
PSA.12.8	The wicked walk on every side,
PSA.12.8	when the vilest men are exalted.
PSA.13.1	How long wilt thou forget me, O 
PSA.13.1	How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
PSA.13.2	How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
PSA.13.2	How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
PSA.13.3	Consider 
PSA.13.3	lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the 
PSA.13.4	lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him;
PSA.13.5	But I have trusted in thy mercy;
PSA.13.5	my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
PSA.13.6	I will sing unto the 
PSA.13.6	because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
PSA.14.1	They are corrupt,
PSA.14.1	they have done abominable works,
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.2	to see if there were any that did understand, 
PSA.14.3	They are all gone aside,
PSA.14.3	they are 
PSA.14.4	Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?
PSA.14.4	who eat up my people 
PSA.14.4	and call not upon the 
PSA.14.5	There were they in great fear:
PSA.14.5	for God 
PSA.14.6	Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor,
PSA.14.6	because the 
PSA.14.7	Oh that the salvation of Israel 
PSA.14.7	When the 
PSA.14.7	Jacob shall rejoice, 
PSA.15.1	Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
PSA.15.2	He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness,
PSA.15.2	and speaketh the truth in his heart.
PSA.15.3	nor doeth evil to his neighbor,
PSA.15.3	nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor.
PSA.15.4	In whose eyes a vile person is contemned;
PSA.15.4	but he honoreth them that fear the 
PSA.15.5	nor taketh reward against the innocent.
PSA.15.5	He that doeth these 
PSA.16.1	Preserve me, O God:
PSA.16.1	for in thee do I put my trust.
PSA.16.2	my goodness 
PSA.16.3	and 
PSA.16.4	Their sorrows shall be multiplied 
PSA.16.4	their drink offerings of blood will I not offer,
PSA.16.4	nor take up their names into my lips.
PSA.16.5	The 
PSA.16.5	thou maintainest my lot.
PSA.16.6	The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant 
PSA.16.6	yea, I have a goodly heritage.
PSA.16.7	I will bless the 
PSA.16.7	my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
PSA.16.8	because 
PSA.16.9	Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth:
PSA.16.9	my flesh also shall rest in hope.
PSA.16.10	neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
PSA.16.11	Thou wilt show me the path of life:
PSA.16.11	in thy presence 
PSA.16.11	at thy right hand 
PSA.17.1	Hear the right, O 
PSA.17.1	attend unto my cry;
PSA.17.1	give ear unto my prayer,
PSA.17.2	Let my sentence come forth from thy presence;
PSA.17.2	let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
PSA.17.3	Thou hast proved mine heart;
PSA.17.3	thou hast visited 
PSA.17.3	thou hast tried me, 
PSA.17.3	I am purposed 
PSA.17.4	Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips
PSA.17.4	I have kept 
PSA.17.5	Hold up my goings in thy paths,
PSA.17.6	I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God:
PSA.17.6	incline thine ear unto me, 
PSA.17.7	Show thy marvelous loving-kindness,
PSA.17.7	O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust 
PSA.17.7	from those that rise up 
PSA.17.8	Keep me as the apple of the eye;
PSA.17.8	hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
PSA.17.9	from the wicked that oppress me,
PSA.17.10	They are inclosed in their own fat:
PSA.17.10	with their mouth they speak proudly.
PSA.17.11	They have now compassed us in our steps:
PSA.17.11	they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
PSA.17.12	like as a lion 
PSA.17.12	and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
PSA.17.13	Arise, O 
PSA.17.13	deliver my soul from the wicked, 
PSA.17.14	from men 
PSA.17.14	from men of the world, 
PSA.17.14	and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid 
PSA.17.14	they are full of children,
PSA.17.14	and leave the rest of their 
PSA.17.15	As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness:
PSA.17.15	I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
PSA.18.1	I will love thee, O 
PSA.18.2	The 
PSA.18.2	my God, my strength, in whom I will trust;
PSA.18.2	my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, 
PSA.18.3	I will call upon the 
PSA.18.3	so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
PSA.18.4	The sorrows of death compassed me,
PSA.18.4	and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
PSA.18.5	The sorrows of hell
PSA.18.5	the snares of death prevented me.
PSA.18.6	In my distress I called upon the 
PSA.18.6	and cried unto my God:
PSA.18.6	he heard my voice out of his temple,
PSA.18.6	and my cry came before him, 
PSA.18.7	Then the earth shook and trembled;
PSA.18.7	the foundations also of the hills moved
PSA.18.7	and were shaken, because he was wroth.
PSA.18.8	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,
PSA.18.8	and fire out of his mouth devoured:
PSA.18.8	coals were kindled by it.
PSA.18.9	He bowed the heavens also, and came down:
PSA.18.9	and darkness 
PSA.18.10	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly:
PSA.18.10	yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He made darkness his secret place;
PSA.18.11	his pavilion round about him 
PSA.18.12	At the brightness 
PSA.18.12	hail 
PSA.18.13	The 
PSA.18.13	and the Highest gave his voice;
PSA.18.13	hail 
PSA.18.14	Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them;
PSA.18.14	and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
PSA.18.15	Then the channels of waters were seen,
PSA.18.15	and the foundations of the world were discovered
PSA.18.15	at thy rebuke, O 
PSA.18.15	at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
PSA.18.16	He sent from above, he took me,
PSA.18.16	he drew me out of many waters.
PSA.18.17	He delivered me from my strong enemy,
PSA.18.17	and from them which hated me:
PSA.18.17	for they were too strong for me.
PSA.18.18	They prevented me in the day of my calamity:
PSA.18.18	but the 
PSA.18.19	He brought me forth also into a large place;
PSA.18.19	he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
PSA.18.20	The 
PSA.18.20	according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
PSA.18.21	For I have kept the ways of the 
PSA.18.21	and have not wickedly departed from my God.
PSA.18.22	For all his judgments 
PSA.18.22	and I did not put away his statutes from me.
PSA.18.23	I was also upright before him,
PSA.18.23	and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
PSA.18.24	Therefore hath the 
PSA.18.24	according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
PSA.18.25	With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful;
PSA.18.25	with an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright;
PSA.18.26	with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure;
PSA.18.26	and with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward.
PSA.18.27	For thou wilt save the afflicted people;
PSA.18.27	but wilt bring down high looks.
PSA.18.28	For thou wilt light my candle:
PSA.18.28	the 
PSA.18.29	For by thee I have run through a troop;
PSA.18.29	and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
PSA.18.30	the word of the 
PSA.18.30	he 
PSA.18.31	For who 
PSA.18.31	Or who 
PSA.18.32	and maketh my way perfect.
PSA.18.33	and setteth me upon my high places.
PSA.18.34	He teacheth my hands to war,
PSA.18.34	so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
PSA.18.35	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation:
PSA.18.35	and thy right hand hath holden me up,
PSA.18.35	and thy gentleness hath made me great.
PSA.18.36	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
PSA.18.36	that my feet did not slip.
PSA.18.37	I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them:
PSA.18.37	neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
PSA.18.38	I have wounded them that they were not able to rise:
PSA.18.38	they are fallen under my feet.
PSA.18.39	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle:
PSA.18.39	thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
PSA.18.40	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies;
PSA.18.40	that I might destroy them that hate me.
PSA.18.41	They cried, but 
PSA.18.42	Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind:
PSA.18.42	I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
PSA.18.43	Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people;
PSA.18.43	a people 
PSA.18.44	As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me:
PSA.18.44	the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
PSA.18.45	The strangers shall fade away,
PSA.18.45	and be afraid out of their close places.
PSA.18.46	The 
PSA.18.46	and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
PSA.18.47	and subdueth the people under me.
PSA.18.48	He delivereth me from mine enemies:
PSA.18.48	yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me:
PSA.18.48	thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
PSA.18.49	and sing praises unto thy name.
PSA.18.50	Great deliverance giveth he to his king;
PSA.18.50	and showeth mercy to his anointed,
PSA.18.50	to David, and to his seed for evermore.
PSA.19.1	The heavens declare the glory of God;
PSA.19.1	and the firmament showeth his handiwork.
PSA.19.2	Day unto day uttereth speech,
PSA.19.2	and night unto night showeth knowledge.
PSA.19.4	and their words to the end of the world.
PSA.19.4	In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
PSA.19.5	which

PSA.19.7	converting the soul:
PSA.19.7	the testimony of the 
PSA.19.7	making wise the simple.
PSA.19.8	The statutes of the 
PSA.19.8	rejoicing the heart:
PSA.19.8	the commandment of the 
PSA.19.8	enlightening the eyes.
PSA.19.9	The fear of the 
PSA.19.9	enduring for ever:
PSA.19.9	the judgments of the 
PSA.19.10	More to be desired 
PSA.19.10	yea, than much fine gold:
PSA.19.10	sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
PSA.19.11	Moreover by them is thy servant warned:
PSA.19.12	Who can understand 
PSA.19.12	Cleanse thou me from secret 
PSA.19.13	Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous 
PSA.19.13	let them not have dominion over me:
PSA.19.13	then shall I be upright,
PSA.19.13	and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
PSA.19.14	Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart,
PSA.19.14	be acceptable in thy sight,
PSA.19.14	O 
PSA.20.1	The 
PSA.20.1	the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
PSA.20.2	send thee help from the sanctuary,
PSA.20.2	and strengthen thee out of Zion;
PSA.20.3	remember all thy offerings,
PSA.20.3	and accept thy burnt sacrifice. 
PSA.20.4	Grant thee according to thine own heart,
PSA.20.4	and fulfil all thy counsel.
PSA.20.5	We will rejoice in thy salvation,
PSA.20.5	and in the name of our God we will set up 
PSA.20.5	the 
PSA.20.6	Now know I that the 
PSA.20.6	he will hear him from his holy heaven
PSA.20.6	with the saving strength of his right hand.
PSA.20.7	Some 
PSA.20.7	but we will remember the name of the 
PSA.20.8	They are brought down and fallen:
PSA.20.8	but we are risen, and stand upright.
PSA.20.9	Save, 
PSA.20.9	let the king hear us when we call.
PSA.21.1	The king shall joy in thy strength, O 
PSA.21.1	and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
PSA.21.2	Thou hast given him his heart's desire,
PSA.21.2	and hast not withholden the request of his lips. 
PSA.21.3	For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness:
PSA.21.3	thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
PSA.21.4	He asked life of thee, 
PSA.21.5	His glory 
PSA.21.5	honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
PSA.21.6	For thou hast made him most blessed for ever:
PSA.21.6	thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
PSA.21.7	For the king trusteth in the 
PSA.21.7	and through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.
PSA.21.8	Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies:
PSA.21.8	thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
PSA.21.9	Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven
PSA.21.9	in the time of thine anger:
PSA.21.9	the 
PSA.21.9	and the fire shall devour them.
PSA.21.10	Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth,
PSA.21.10	and their seed from among the children of men.
PSA.21.11	For they intended evil against thee:
PSA.21.11	they imagined a mischievous device, 
PSA.21.12	Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back,
PSA.21.13	Be thou exalted, 
PSA.22.2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not;
PSA.22.2	and in the night season, and am not silent.
PSA.22.3	But thou 
PSA.22.4	Our fathers trusted in thee:
PSA.22.4	they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
PSA.22.5	They cried unto thee, and were delivered:
PSA.22.5	they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
PSA.22.6	But I 
PSA.22.6	a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
PSA.22.7	they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, 
PSA.22.8	let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
PSA.22.9	But thou 
PSA.22.9	thou didst make me hope 
PSA.22.10	I was cast upon thee from the womb:
PSA.22.10	thou 
PSA.22.11	Be not far from me; for trouble 
PSA.22.11	for 
PSA.22.12	Many bulls have compassed me:
PSA.22.12	strong 
PSA.22.13	They gaped upon me 
PSA.22.14	I am poured out like water,
PSA.22.14	and all my bones are out of joint:
PSA.22.14	my heart is like wax;
PSA.22.14	it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
PSA.22.15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd;
PSA.22.15	and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws;
PSA.22.15	and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
PSA.22.16	For dogs have compassed me:
PSA.22.16	the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me:
PSA.22.16	they pierced my hands and my feet.
PSA.22.17	I may tell all my bones:
PSA.22.17	they look 
PSA.22.18	and cast lots upon my vesture.
PSA.22.19	But be not thou far from me, O 
PSA.22.19	O my strength, haste thee to help me.
PSA.22.20	Deliver my soul from the sword;
PSA.22.20	my darling from the power of the dog.
PSA.22.21	Save me from the lion's mouth:
PSA.22.21	for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
PSA.22.22	in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
PSA.22.23	Ye that fear the 
PSA.22.23	all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him;
PSA.22.23	and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
PSA.22.24	For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted;
PSA.22.24	neither hath he hid his face from him;
PSA.22.24	but when he cried unto him, he heard.
PSA.22.25	My praise 
PSA.22.25	I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
PSA.22.26	The meek shall eat and be satisfied:
PSA.22.26	they shall praise the 
PSA.22.26	your heart shall live for ever.
PSA.22.27	All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the 
PSA.22.27	and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
PSA.22.28	For the kingdom 
PSA.22.28	and he 
PSA.22.29	All 
PSA.22.29	all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him:
PSA.22.29	and none can keep alive his own soul.
PSA.22.30	A seed shall serve him;
PSA.22.30	it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
PSA.22.31	They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness
PSA.22.31	unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done 
PSA.23.1	The 
PSA.23.2	he leadeth me beside the still waters.
PSA.23.3	He restoreth my soul:
PSA.23.3	he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
PSA.23.4	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
PSA.23.4	I will fear no evil: for thou 
PSA.23.4	thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
PSA.23.5	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
PSA.23.5	thou anointest my head with oil;
PSA.23.5	my cup runneth over.
PSA.23.6	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:
PSA.23.6	and I will dwell in the house of the 
PSA.24.1	the world, and they that dwell therein.
PSA.24.2	For he hath founded it upon the seas,
PSA.24.2	and established it upon the floods.
PSA.24.3	Who shall ascend into the hill of the 
PSA.24.3	Or who shall stand in his holy place?
PSA.24.4	who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity,
PSA.24.4	nor sworn deceitfully.
PSA.24.5	He shall receive the blessing from the 
PSA.24.5	and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
PSA.24.6	This 
PSA.24.6	that seek thy face, O Jacob. 
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, O ye gates;
PSA.24.7	and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors;
PSA.24.7	and the King of glory shall come in.

PSA.25.2	O my God, I trust in thee:
PSA.25.2	let me not be ashamed,
PSA.25.2	let not mine enemies triumph over me.
PSA.25.3	Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed:
PSA.25.3	let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.
PSA.25.4	Show me thy ways, O 
PSA.25.4	teach me thy paths.
PSA.25.5	Lead me in thy truth, and teach me:
PSA.25.5	for thou 
PSA.25.5	on thee do I wait all the day.
PSA.25.6	Remember, O 
PSA.25.6	for they 
PSA.25.7	Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
PSA.25.7	according to thy mercy remember thou me
PSA.25.7	for thy goodness' sake, O 
PSA.25.8	Good and upright 
PSA.25.8	therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
PSA.25.9	The meek will he guide in judgment:
PSA.25.9	and the meek will he teach his way.
PSA.25.10	All the paths of the 
PSA.25.10	unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
PSA.25.11	For thy name's sake, O 
PSA.25.11	pardon mine iniquity; for it 
PSA.25.12	What man 
PSA.25.12	Him shall he teach in the way 
PSA.25.13	His soul shall dwell at ease;
PSA.25.13	and his seed shall inherit the earth.
PSA.25.14	The secret of the 
PSA.25.14	and he will show them his covenant.
PSA.25.15	Mine eyes 
PSA.25.15	for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
PSA.25.16	Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me;
PSA.25.16	for I 
PSA.25.17	The troubles of my heart are enlarged:
PSA.25.18	Look upon mine affliction and my pain;
PSA.25.18	and forgive all my sins.
PSA.25.19	Consider mine enemies; for they are many;
PSA.25.19	and they hate me with cruel hatred.
PSA.25.20	O keep my soul, and deliver me:
PSA.25.20	let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
PSA.25.21	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me;
PSA.25.21	for I wait on thee.
PSA.25.22	Redeem Israel, O God,
PSA.25.22	out of all his troubles.
PSA.26.1	Judge me, O 
PSA.26.1	for I have walked in mine integrity:
PSA.26.1	I have trusted also in the 
PSA.26.2	Examine me, O 
PSA.26.2	try my reins and my heart.
PSA.26.3	For thy loving-kindness 
PSA.26.3	and I have walked in thy truth.
PSA.26.4	I have not sat with vain persons,
PSA.26.4	neither will I go in with dissemblers.
PSA.26.5	I have hated the congregation of evildoers;
PSA.26.5	and will not sit with the wicked.
PSA.26.6	I will wash mine hands in innocency:
PSA.26.6	so will I compass thine altar, O 
PSA.26.7	that I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving,
PSA.26.7	and tell of all thy wondrous works.
PSA.26.8	and the place where thine honor dwelleth.
PSA.26.9	Gather not my soul with sinners,
PSA.26.9	nor my life with bloody men:
PSA.26.10	in whose hands 
PSA.26.10	and their right hand is full of bribes.
PSA.26.11	But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity:
PSA.26.11	redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
PSA.26.12	My foot standeth in an even place:
PSA.26.12	in the congregations will I bless the 
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	whom shall I fear?
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	of whom shall I be afraid?
PSA.27.2	When the wicked, 
PSA.27.2	came upon me to eat up my flesh,
PSA.27.2	they stumbled and fell.
PSA.27.3	Though a host should encamp against me,
PSA.27.3	my heart shall not fear:
PSA.27.3	though war should rise against me,
PSA.27.3	in this 
PSA.27.4	One 
PSA.27.4	that will I seek after;
PSA.27.4	that I may dwell in the house of the 
PSA.27.4	all the days of my life,
PSA.27.4	to behold the beauty of the 
PSA.27.4	and to inquire in his temple.
PSA.27.5	For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
PSA.27.5	in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me;
PSA.27.5	he shall set me up upon a rock.
PSA.27.6	And now shall mine head be lifted up
PSA.27.6	above mine enemies round about me:
PSA.27.6	therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;
PSA.27.6	I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the 
PSA.27.7	Hear, O 
PSA.27.7	have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
PSA.27.8	my heart said unto thee,
PSA.27.8	Thy face, 
PSA.27.9	Hide not thy face 
PSA.27.9	put not thy servant away in anger:
PSA.27.9	thou hast been my help;
PSA.27.9	leave me not, neither forsake me,
PSA.27.9	O God of my salvation.
PSA.27.10	When my father and my mother forsake me,
PSA.27.10	then the 
PSA.27.11	Teach me thy way, O 
PSA.27.11	and lead me in a plain path,
PSA.27.11	because of mine enemies.
PSA.27.12	Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies:
PSA.27.12	for false witnesses are risen up against me,
PSA.27.12	and such as breathe out cruelty.
PSA.27.13	to see the goodness of the 
PSA.27.14	Wait on the 
PSA.27.14	be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart:
PSA.27.14	wait, I say, on the 
PSA.28.1	Unto thee will I cry, O 
PSA.28.1	be not silent to me:
PSA.28.1	lest, 
PSA.28.1	I become like them that go down into the pit.
PSA.28.2	Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee,
PSA.28.2	when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
PSA.28.3	Draw me not away with the wicked,
PSA.28.3	and with the workers of iniquity,
PSA.28.3	which speak peace to their neighbors,
PSA.28.3	but mischief 
PSA.28.4	and according to the wickedness of their endeavors:
PSA.28.4	give them after the work of their hands;
PSA.28.4	render to them their desert.
PSA.28.5	Because they regard not the works of the 
PSA.28.5	nor the operation of his hands,
PSA.28.5	he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
PSA.28.6	Blessed 
PSA.28.6	because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
PSA.28.7	The 
PSA.28.7	my heart trusted in him, and I am helped:
PSA.28.7	therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
PSA.28.7	and with my song will I praise him.
PSA.28.8	The

PSA.29.2	Give unto the 
PSA.29.2	worship the 
PSA.29.3	The voice of the 
PSA.29.3	the God of glory thundereth:

PSA.29.4	The voice of the 
PSA.29.4	the voice of the 
PSA.29.5	The voice of the 
PSA.29.5	yea, the 
PSA.29.6	He maketh them also to skip like a calf;

PSA.29.8	The voice of the 
PSA.29.8	the 
PSA.29.9	The voice of the 
PSA.29.9	and discovereth the forests:
PSA.29.9	and in his temple doth every one speak of 
PSA.29.10	The 
PSA.29.10	yea, the 
PSA.29.11	The 
PSA.29.11	the 
PSA.30.1	I will extol thee, O 
PSA.30.1	and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
PSA.30.2	O 
PSA.30.2	and thou hast healed me.
PSA.30.3	O 
PSA.30.3	thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
PSA.30.4	Sing unto the 
PSA.30.4	and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
PSA.30.5	For his anger 
PSA.30.5	in his favor 
PSA.30.5	weeping may endure for a night,
PSA.30.5	but joy 
PSA.30.6	And in my prosperity I said,
PSA.30.6	I shall never be moved.
PSA.30.7	thou didst hide thy face, 
PSA.30.8	I cried to thee, O 
PSA.30.8	and unto the 
PSA.30.9	What profit 
PSA.30.9	when I go down to the pit?
PSA.30.9	Shall the dust praise thee?
PSA.30.9	Shall it declare thy truth?
PSA.30.10	Hear, O 
PSA.30.11	Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing:
PSA.30.11	thou hast put off my sackcloth,
PSA.30.11	and girded me with gladness;
PSA.30.12	to the end that 
PSA.30.12	O 
PSA.31.1	In thee, O 
PSA.31.1	let me never be ashamed:
PSA.31.1	deliver me in thy righteousness.
PSA.31.2	Bow down thine ear to me;
PSA.31.2	deliver me speedily:
PSA.31.2	be thou my strong rock,
PSA.31.2	for a house of defense to save me.
PSA.31.3	For thou 
PSA.31.3	therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
PSA.31.4	Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me:
PSA.31.4	for thou 
PSA.31.5	thou hast redeemed me, O 
PSA.31.6	I have hated them that regard lying vanities:
PSA.31.6	but I trust in the 
PSA.31.7	I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy:
PSA.31.7	for thou hast considered my trouble;
PSA.31.7	thou hast known my soul in adversities;
PSA.31.8	and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy:
PSA.31.8	thou hast set my feet in a large room.
PSA.31.9	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.31.9	mine eye is consumed with grief,
PSA.31.10	For my life is spent with grief,
PSA.31.10	and my years with sighing:
PSA.31.10	my strength faileth because of mine iniquity,
PSA.31.10	and my bones are consumed.
PSA.31.11	I was a reproach among all mine enemies,
PSA.31.11	but especially among my neighbors,
PSA.31.11	and a fear to mine acquaintance:
PSA.31.11	they that did see me without fled from me.
PSA.31.12	I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind:
PSA.31.12	I am like a broken vessel.
PSA.31.13	For I have heard the slander of many:
PSA.31.13	fear 
PSA.31.13	while they took counsel together against me,
PSA.31.13	they devised to take away my life.
PSA.31.14	But I trusted in thee, O 
PSA.31.14	I said, Thou 
PSA.31.15	My times 
PSA.31.15	deliver me from the hand of mine enemies,
PSA.31.15	and from them that persecute me.
PSA.31.16	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant:
PSA.31.16	save me for thy mercies' sake.
PSA.31.17	Let me not be ashamed, O 
PSA.31.17	for I have called upon thee:
PSA.31.17	let the wicked be ashamed,
PSA.31.18	Let the lying lips be put to silence;
PSA.31.18	which speak grievous things
PSA.31.18	proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
PSA.31.19	which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee;
PSA.31.19	before the sons of men!
PSA.31.20	Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence
PSA.31.20	from the pride of man:
PSA.31.20	thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion
PSA.31.20	from the strife of tongues.
PSA.31.21	Blessed 
PSA.31.21	for he hath showed me his marvelous kindness in a strong city.
PSA.31.22	For I said in my haste,
PSA.31.22	I am cut off from before thine eyes:
PSA.31.22	nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications
PSA.31.22	when I cried unto thee.
PSA.31.23	O love the 
PSA.31.23	and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
PSA.31.24	Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart,
PSA.31.24	all ye that hope in the 
PSA.32.2	Blessed 
PSA.32.2	and in whose spirit 
PSA.32.3	When I kept silence, my bones waxed old
PSA.32.3	through my roaring all the day long.
PSA.32.4	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me:
PSA.32.4	my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. 
PSA.32.5	and mine iniquity have I not hid.
PSA.32.5	I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the 
PSA.32.5	and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. 
PSA.32.6	For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee
PSA.32.6	in a time when thou mayest be found:
PSA.32.6	surely in the floods of great waters
PSA.32.6	they shall not come nigh unto him.
PSA.32.7	Thou 
PSA.32.7	thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
PSA.32.7	thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. 
PSA.32.8	I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go:
PSA.32.8	I will guide thee with mine eye.
PSA.32.9	Be ye not as the horse, 
PSA.32.9	whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle,
PSA.32.9	lest they come near unto thee.
PSA.32.10	Many sorrows 
PSA.32.10	but he that trusteth in the 
PSA.32.11	Be glad in the 
PSA.32.11	and shout for joy, all 
PSA.33.1	Rejoice in the 
PSA.33.2	Praise the

PSA.33.3	Sing unto him a new song;
PSA.33.3	play skilfully with a loud noise.
PSA.33.4	For the word of the 
PSA.33.4	and all his works 
PSA.33.5	He loveth righteousness and judgment:
PSA.33.5	the earth is full of the goodness of the 
PSA.33.6	By the word of the 
PSA.33.6	and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
PSA.33.7	He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap:
PSA.33.7	he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
PSA.33.8	Let all the earth fear the 
PSA.33.8	let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
PSA.33.9	For he spake, and it was 
PSA.33.9	he commanded, and it stood fast.
PSA.33.10	The 
PSA.33.10	he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
PSA.33.11	The counsel of the 
PSA.33.11	the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
PSA.33.12	Blessed 
PSA.33.13	The 
PSA.33.13	he beholdeth all the sons of men.
PSA.33.14	From the place of his habitation he looketh
PSA.33.14	upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
PSA.33.15	He fashioneth their hearts alike;
PSA.33.15	he considereth all their works.
PSA.33.16	There is no king saved by the multitude of a host:
PSA.33.16	a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
PSA.33.17	A horse 
PSA.33.17	neither shall he deliver 
PSA.33.18	Behold, the eye of the 
PSA.33.18	upon them that hope in his mercy;
PSA.33.19	to deliver their soul from death,
PSA.33.19	and to keep them alive in famine.
PSA.33.20	Our soul waiteth for the 
PSA.33.20	he

PSA.34.2	My soul shall make her boast in the 
PSA.34.2	the humble shall hear 
PSA.34.3	O magnify the 
PSA.34.3	and let us exalt his name together.
PSA.34.4	I sought the 
PSA.34.4	and delivered me from all my fears.
PSA.34.5	They looked unto him, and were lightened:
PSA.34.5	and their faces were not ashamed.
PSA.34.6	This poor man cried, and the 
PSA.34.6	and saved him out of all his troubles.

PSA.34.9	O fear the 
PSA.34.9	for 
PSA.34.10	The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger:
PSA.34.10	but they that seek the 
PSA.34.11	Come, ye children, hearken unto me:
PSA.34.11	I will teach you the fear of the 
PSA.34.13	Keep thy tongue from evil,
PSA.34.13	and thy lips from speaking guile.
PSA.34.14	Depart from evil, and do good;
PSA.34.14	seek peace, and pursue it.
PSA.34.15	The eyes of the 
PSA.34.15	and his ears 
PSA.34.16	The face of the 
PSA.34.16	to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
PSA.34.17	and delivereth them out of all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.18	and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
PSA.34.19	Many 
PSA.34.19	but the 
PSA.34.20	not one of them is broken.
PSA.34.21	Evil shall slay the wicked:
PSA.34.21	and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
PSA.34.22	The 
PSA.34.22	and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
PSA.35.1	Plead 
PSA.35.1	fight against them that fight against me.
PSA.35.2	Take hold of shield and buckler,
PSA.35.2	and stand up for mine help.
PSA.35.3	Draw out also the spear,
PSA.35.3	and stop 
PSA.35.3	say unto my soul, I 
PSA.35.4	Let them be confounded and put to shame
PSA.35.4	that seek after my soul:
PSA.35.4	let them be turned back and brought to confusion
PSA.35.4	that devise my hurt.
PSA.35.5	Let them be as chaff before the wind:
PSA.35.5	and let the angel of the 
PSA.35.6	Let their way be dark and slippery:
PSA.35.6	and let the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	For without cause have they hid for me their net 
PSA.35.8	Let destruction come upon him at unawares;
PSA.35.8	and let his net that he hath hid catch himself:
PSA.35.8	into that very destruction let him fall.
PSA.35.9	And my soul shall be joyful in the 
PSA.35.9	it shall rejoice in his salvation.
PSA.35.10	All my bones shall say,
PSA.35.10	which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him,
PSA.35.10	yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
PSA.35.11	False witnesses did rise up;
PSA.35.11	they laid to my charge 
PSA.35.12	They rewarded me evil for good 
PSA.35.13	But as for me, when they were sick,
PSA.35.13	my clothing 
PSA.35.13	I humbled my soul with fasting;
PSA.35.13	and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
PSA.35.14	I behaved myself as though 
PSA.35.14	I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth 
PSA.35.15	But in mine adversity they rejoiced,
PSA.35.15	and gathered themselves together:
PSA.35.15	and I knew 
PSA.35.15	they did tear 
PSA.35.16	with hypocritical mockers in feasts,
PSA.35.16	they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
PSA.35.17	Lord, how long wilt thou look on?
PSA.35.17	Rescue my soul from their destructions,
PSA.35.17	my darling from the lions.
PSA.35.18	I will give thee thanks in the great congregation:
PSA.35.18	I will praise thee among much people.
PSA.35.20	For they speak not peace:
PSA.35.20	but they devise deceitful matters against 
PSA.35.21	Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me,
PSA.35.22	O Lord, be not far from me.
PSA.35.23	Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment,
PSA.35.24	Judge me, O 
PSA.35.24	and let them not rejoice over me.
PSA.35.25	Let them not say in their hearts,
PSA.35.25	Ah, so would we have it:
PSA.35.25	let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
PSA.35.26	Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together
PSA.35.26	that rejoice at mine hurt:
PSA.35.26	let them be clothed with shame and dishonor
PSA.35.26	that magnify 
PSA.35.27	Let them shout for joy, and be glad,
PSA.35.27	that favor my righteous cause:
PSA.35.27	yea, let them say continually,
PSA.35.27	Let the 
PSA.35.27	which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
PSA.35.28	And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness
PSA.36.2	For he flattereth himself in his own eyes,
PSA.36.2	until his iniquity be found to be hateful.
PSA.36.3	The words of his mouth 
PSA.36.3	he hath left off to be wise, 
PSA.36.4	He deviseth mischief upon his bed;
PSA.36.4	he setteth himself in a way 
PSA.36.4	he abhorreth not evil.
PSA.36.5	Thy mercy, O 
PSA.36.6	Thy righteousness 
PSA.36.6	thy judgments 
PSA.36.6	O 
PSA.36.7	How excellent 
PSA.36.7	Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
PSA.36.8	They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
PSA.36.8	and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
PSA.36.9	For with thee 
PSA.36.9	in thy light shall we see light.
PSA.36.10	O continue thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee;
PSA.36.10	and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
PSA.36.11	Let not the foot of pride come against me,
PSA.36.11	and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
PSA.36.12	There are the workers of iniquity fallen:
PSA.36.12	they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
PSA.37.1	Fret not thyself because of evildoers,
PSA.37.1	neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
PSA.37.2	For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,
PSA.37.2	and wither as the green herb.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.4	Delight thyself also in the 
PSA.37.4	and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.
PSA.37.5	Commit thy way unto the 
PSA.37.5	trust also in him; and he shall bring 
PSA.37.6	And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light,
PSA.37.6	and thy judgment as the noonday.
PSA.37.7	Rest in the 
PSA.37.7	fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way,
PSA.37.7	because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
PSA.37.8	Cease from anger, and forsake wrath:
PSA.37.8	fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
PSA.37.9	For evildoers shall be cut off:
PSA.37.9	but those that wait upon the 
PSA.37.10	For yet a little while, and the wicked 
PSA.37.10	yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it 
PSA.37.11	and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plotteth against the just,
PSA.37.12	and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
PSA.37.13	The Lord shall laugh at him:
PSA.37.13	for he seeth that his day is coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
PSA.37.14	to cast down the poor and needy,
PSA.37.15	Their sword shall enter into their own heart,
PSA.37.15	and their bows shall be broken.
PSA.37.16	A little that a righteous man hath
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken:
PSA.37.17	but the 
PSA.37.18	The 
PSA.37.18	and their inheritance shall be for ever.
PSA.37.19	They shall not be ashamed in the evil time:
PSA.37.19	and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked shall perish,
PSA.37.20	and the enemies of the 
PSA.37.20	they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again:
PSA.37.21	but the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth.
PSA.37.22	For 
PSA.37.22	and 
PSA.37.23	The steps of a 
PSA.37.23	and he delighteth in his way.
PSA.37.24	Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down:
PSA.37.24	for the 
PSA.37.25	I have been young, and 
PSA.37.25	yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken,
PSA.37.25	nor his seed begging bread.
PSA.37.26	and his seed 
PSA.37.27	Depart from evil, and do good;
PSA.37.27	and dwell for evermore.
PSA.37.28	For the 
PSA.37.28	and forsaketh not his saints;
PSA.37.28	they are preserved for ever:
PSA.37.28	but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.29	The righteous shall inherit the land,
PSA.37.29	and dwell therein for ever.
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom,
PSA.37.30	and his tongue talketh of judgment.
PSA.37.31	The law of his God 
PSA.37.31	none of his steps shall slide.
PSA.37.32	The wicked watcheth the righteous,
PSA.37.32	and seeketh to slay him.
PSA.37.33	The 
PSA.37.33	nor condemn him when he is judged.
PSA.37.34	Wait on the 
PSA.37.34	and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land:
PSA.37.34	when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see 
PSA.37.35	I have seen the wicked in great power,
PSA.37.35	and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
PSA.37.36	Yet he passed away, and, lo, he 
PSA.37.36	yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	Mark the perfect 
PSA.37.37	for the end of 
PSA.37.38	But the transgressors shall be destroyed together:
PSA.37.38	the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.39	But the salvation of the righteous 
PSA.37.40	And the 
PSA.37.40	he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them,
PSA.37.40	because they trust in him.
PSA.38.1	O 
PSA.38.1	neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
PSA.38.2	For thine arrows stick fast in me,
PSA.38.2	and thy hand presseth me sore.
PSA.38.3	neither 
PSA.38.4	For mine iniquities are gone over mine head:
PSA.38.4	as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
PSA.38.5	My wounds stink 
PSA.38.6	I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly;
PSA.38.6	I go mourning all the day long.
PSA.38.7	For my loins are filled with a loathsome 
PSA.38.7	and 
PSA.38.8	I am feeble and sore broken:
PSA.38.8	I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
PSA.38.9	Lord, all my desire 
PSA.38.9	and my groaning is not hid from thee.
PSA.38.10	My heart panteth, my strength faileth me:
PSA.38.10	as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
PSA.38.11	My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore;
PSA.38.11	and my kinsmen stand afar off.
PSA.38.12	They also that seek after my life lay snares 
PSA.38.12	and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things,
PSA.38.12	and imagine deceits all the day long.
PSA.38.13	But I, as a deaf 
PSA.38.13	and 
PSA.38.14	Thus I was as a man that heareth not,
PSA.38.14	and in whose mouth 
PSA.38.15	For in thee, O 
PSA.38.15	thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
PSA.38.16	For I said, 
PSA.38.16	when my foot slippeth,
PSA.38.16	they magnify 
PSA.38.17	For I 
PSA.38.17	and my sorrow 
PSA.38.18	For I will declare mine iniquity;
PSA.38.18	I will be sorry for my sin.
PSA.38.19	But mine enemies 
PSA.38.19	and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
PSA.38.20	They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
PSA.38.20	because I follow 
PSA.38.21	Forsake me not, O 
PSA.38.21	O my God, be not far from me.
PSA.38.22	Make haste to help me,
PSA.38.22	O Lord my salvation.
PSA.39.1	I said, I will take heed to my ways,
PSA.39.1	that I sin not with my tongue:
PSA.39.1	I will keep my mouth with a bridle,
PSA.39.1	while the wicked is before me.
PSA.39.2	I was dumb with silence,
PSA.39.2	I held my peace, 
PSA.39.2	and my sorrow was stirred.
PSA.39.3	My heart was hot within me;
PSA.39.3	while I was musing the fire burned:
PSA.39.4	and the measure of my days, what it 
PSA.39.5	Behold, thou hast made my days 
PSA.39.5	and mine age 
PSA.39.5	verily every man at his best state 
PSA.39.6	Surely every man walketh in a vain show:
PSA.39.6	surely they are disquieted in vain:
PSA.39.6	he heapeth up 
PSA.39.7	And now, Lord, what wait I for?
PSA.39.7	My hope 
PSA.39.8	Deliver me from all my transgressions:
PSA.39.8	make me not the reproach of the foolish.
PSA.39.9	I was dumb, I opened not my mouth;
PSA.39.9	because thou didst 
PSA.39.10	Remove thy stroke away from me:
PSA.39.10	I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.
PSA.39.11	When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity,
PSA.39.11	thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth:
PSA.39.11	surely every man 
PSA.39.12	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.39.12	hold not thy peace at my tears:
PSA.39.12	for I 
PSA.39.13	O spare me, that I may recover strength,
PSA.39.13	before I go hence, and be no more.
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the 
PSA.40.1	and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,
PSA.40.2	out of the miry clay,
PSA.40.2	and set my feet upon a rock,
PSA.40.3	And he hath put a new song in my mouth,
PSA.40.3	many shall see 
PSA.40.3	and shall trust in the 
PSA.40.4	Blessed 
PSA.40.4	and respecteth not the proud,
PSA.40.4	nor such as turn aside to lies.
PSA.40.5	Many, O 
PSA.40.5	and thy thoughts 
PSA.40.5	they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee:
PSA.40.5	they are more than can be numbered.
PSA.40.6	mine ears hast thou opened:
PSA.40.6	burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
PSA.40.7	Then said I, Lo, I come:
PSA.40.7	in the volume of the book 
PSA.40.8	I delight to do thy will, O my God:
PSA.40.8	yea, thy law 
PSA.40.9	I have preached righteousness in the great congregation:
PSA.40.9	lo, I have not refrained my lips,
PSA.40.9	O 
PSA.40.10	I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart;
PSA.40.10	I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation:
PSA.40.10	I have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth
PSA.40.10	from the great congregation.
PSA.40.11	Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O 
PSA.40.11	let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
PSA.40.12	For innumerable evils have compassed me about:
PSA.40.12	mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
PSA.40.12	they are more than the hairs of mine head:
PSA.40.12	therefore my heart faileth me.
PSA.40.13	Be pleased, O 
PSA.40.13	O 
PSA.40.14	Let them be ashamed and confounded together
PSA.40.14	that seek after my soul to destroy it;
PSA.40.14	let them be driven backward and put to shame
PSA.40.14	that wish me evil.
PSA.40.15	Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame
PSA.40.15	that say unto me, Aha, aha.
PSA.40.16	Let all those that seek thee
PSA.40.16	rejoice and be glad in thee:
PSA.40.16	let such as love thy salvation
PSA.40.16	say continually, The 
PSA.40.17	But I 
PSA.40.17	thou 
PSA.40.17	make no tarrying, O my God.
PSA.41.1	Blessed 
PSA.41.1	the 
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.2	and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.3	thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.
PSA.41.4	I said, 
PSA.41.4	for I have sinned against thee.
PSA.41.5	Mine enemies speak evil of me,
PSA.41.5	When shall he die, and his name perish?
PSA.41.6	And if he come to see 
PSA.41.6	his heart gathereth iniquity to itself;
PSA.41.7	All that hate me whisper together against me:
PSA.41.7	against me do they devise my hurt.
PSA.41.8	An evil disease, 
PSA.41.8	and 
PSA.41.9	which did eat of my bread,
PSA.41.9	hath lifted up 
PSA.41.10	But thou, O 
PSA.41.10	and raise me up, that I may requite them.
PSA.41.11	By this I know that thou favorest me,
PSA.41.11	because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
PSA.41.12	And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity,
PSA.41.12	and settest me before thy face for ever.
PSA.41.13	from everlasting, and to everlasting.
PSA.41.13	Amen, and Amen.
PSA.42.1	As the hart panteth after the water brooks,
PSA.42.1	so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:
PSA.42.2	when shall I come and appear before God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my meat day and night,
PSA.42.3	while they continually say unto me, Where 
PSA.42.4	When I remember these 
PSA.42.4	I pour out my soul in me:
PSA.42.4	for I had gone with the multitude,
PSA.42.4	I went with them to the house of God,
PSA.42.4	with the voice of joy and praise,
PSA.42.4	with a multitude that kept holyday.
PSA.42.5	Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
PSA.42.5	And 
PSA.42.5	Hope thou in God:
PSA.42.5	for I shall yet praise him 
PSA.42.6	O my God, my soul is cast down within me:
PSA.42.6	therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan,
PSA.42.6	and of the Her´monites, from the hill Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts:
PSA.42.7	all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
PSA.42.8	and in the night his song 
PSA.42.9	I will say unto God my rock,
PSA.42.9	Why hast thou forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.42.10	while they say daily unto me, Where 
PSA.42.11	Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
PSA.42.11	And why art thou disquieted within me?
PSA.42.11	Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him,
PSA.43.1	Judge me, O God, and plead my cause
PSA.43.1	against an ungodly nation:
PSA.43.1	O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
PSA.43.2	For thou 
PSA.43.2	why dost thou cast me off?
PSA.43.2	Why go I mourning
PSA.43.2	because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.43.3	O send out thy light and thy truth:
PSA.43.3	let them lead me;
PSA.43.3	let them bring me unto thy holy hill,
PSA.43.3	and to thy tabernacles.
PSA.43.4	Then will I go unto the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	unto God my exceeding joy:
PSA.43.4	yea, upon the harp will I praise thee,
PSA.43.4	O God my God.
PSA.43.5	Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
PSA.43.5	And why art thou disquieted within me?
PSA.43.5	Hope in God: for I shall yet praise him,
PSA.44.1	We have heard with our ears, O God,
PSA.44.1	our fathers have told us,
PSA.44.1	in the times of old.
PSA.44.2	and plantedst them;
PSA.44.2	and cast them out.
PSA.44.3	For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
PSA.44.3	neither did their own arm save them:
PSA.44.3	but thy right hand, and thine arm,
PSA.44.3	and the light of thy countenance,
PSA.44.3	because thou hadst a favor unto them.
PSA.44.4	Thou art my King, O God:
PSA.44.4	command deliverances for Jacob.
PSA.44.5	Through thee will we push down our enemies:
PSA.44.5	through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
PSA.44.6	For I will not trust in my bow,
PSA.44.6	neither shall my sword save me.
PSA.44.7	But thou hast saved us from our enemies,
PSA.44.7	and hast put them to shame that hated us.
PSA.44.8	In God we boast all the day long,
PSA.44.8	and praise thy name for ever. 
PSA.44.9	But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame;
PSA.44.9	and goest not forth with our armies.
PSA.44.10	Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy:
PSA.44.10	and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
PSA.44.11	Thou hast given us like sheep 
PSA.44.11	and hast scattered us among the heathen.
PSA.44.12	Thou sellest thy people for nought,
PSA.44.12	and dost not increase 
PSA.44.13	Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors,
PSA.44.13	a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
PSA.44.14	Thou makest us a byword among the heathen,
PSA.44.14	a shaking of the head among the people.
PSA.44.15	My confusion 
PSA.44.15	and the shame of my face hath covered me,
PSA.44.16	for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth;
PSA.44.16	by reason of the enemy and avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this is come upon us;
PSA.44.17	yet have we not forgotten thee,
PSA.44.17	neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our heart is not turned back,
PSA.44.18	neither have our steps declined from thy way;
PSA.44.19	though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons,
PSA.44.19	and covered us with the shadow of death.
PSA.44.20	If we have forgotten the name of our God,
PSA.44.20	or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
PSA.44.21	shall not God search this out?
PSA.44.21	For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
PSA.44.22	we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
PSA.44.23	Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?
PSA.44.23	Arise, cast 
PSA.44.24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
PSA.44.25	For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
PSA.44.25	our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
PSA.44.26	Arise for our help,
PSA.44.26	and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
PSA.45.1	My heart is inditing a good matter:
PSA.45.1	I speak of the things which I have made touching the King:
PSA.45.1	my tongue 
PSA.45.2	Thou art fairer than the children of men:
PSA.45.2	grace is poured into thy lips:
PSA.45.2	therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
PSA.45.3	Gird thy sword upon 
PSA.45.3	with thy glory and thy majesty.
PSA.45.4	And in thy majesty ride prosperously,
PSA.45.4	because of truth and meekness 
PSA.45.4	and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
PSA.45.5	Thine arrows 
PSA.45.5	in the heart of the King's enemies;
PSA.45.6	the sceptre of thy kingdom 
PSA.45.7	Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness:
PSA.45.7	therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee
PSA.45.7	with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
PSA.45.8	All thy garments 
PSA.45.8	out of the ivory palaces,
PSA.45.8	whereby they have made thee glad.
PSA.45.9	Kings' daughters 
PSA.45.9	upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
PSA.45.10	forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
PSA.45.11	so shall the King greatly desire thy beauty:
PSA.45.11	for he 
PSA.45.12	And the daughter of Tyre 
PSA.45.13	The King's daughter 
PSA.45.13	her clothing 
PSA.45.14	She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework:
PSA.45.14	the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
PSA.45.15	With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought:
PSA.45.15	they shall enter into the King's palace.
PSA.45.16	Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children,
PSA.45.16	whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
PSA.45.17	I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
PSA.45.17	therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God 
PSA.46.1	a very present help in trouble.
PSA.46.2	Therefore will not we fear,
PSA.46.2	though the earth be removed,
PSA.46.2	and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
PSA.46.4	the holy 
PSA.46.5	God 
PSA.46.5	she shall not be moved:
PSA.46.5	God shall help her, 
PSA.46.6	The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved:
PSA.46.6	he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.7	the God of Jacob 
PSA.46.8	Come, behold the works of the 
PSA.46.8	what desolations he hath made in the earth.
PSA.46.9	He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth;
PSA.46.9	he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder;
PSA.46.9	he burneth the chariot in the fire.
PSA.46.10	Be still, and know that I 
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted among the heathen,
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted in the earth.
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.46.11	the God of Jacob 
PSA.47.1	O clap your hands, all ye people;
PSA.47.1	shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
PSA.47.2	For the 
PSA.47.3	He shall subdue the people under us,
PSA.47.3	and the nations under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He shall choose our inheritance for us,
PSA.47.4	the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. 
PSA.47.5	God is gone up with a shout,
PSA.47.5	the 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God, sing praises:
PSA.47.6	sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
PSA.47.7	For God 
PSA.47.7	sing ye praises with understanding.
PSA.47.8	God reigneth over the heathen:
PSA.47.8	God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.
PSA.47.9	The princes of the people are gathered together,
PSA.47.9	for the shields of the earth 
PSA.47.9	he is greatly exalted.
PSA.48.1	Great 
PSA.48.1	and greatly to be praised
PSA.48.1	in the city of our God,
PSA.48.2	the city of the great King.
PSA.48.3	God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
PSA.48.4	For, lo, the kings were assembled,
PSA.48.4	they passed by together.
PSA.48.5	They saw 
PSA.48.5	they were troubled, 
PSA.48.6	Fear took hold upon them there,
PSA.48.7	Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish
PSA.48.7	with an east wind.
PSA.48.8	As we have heard, so have we seen
PSA.48.8	in the city of the 
PSA.48.8	in the city of our God:
PSA.48.8	God will establish it for ever. 
PSA.48.9	We have thought of thy loving-kindness, O God,
PSA.48.9	in the midst of thy temple.
PSA.48.10	According to thy name, O God,
PSA.48.10	so 
PSA.48.10	thy right hand is full of righteousness.
PSA.48.11	Let mount Zion rejoice,
PSA.48.11	let the daughters of Judah be glad,
PSA.48.11	because of thy judgments.
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion, and go round about her:
PSA.48.12	tell the towers thereof.
PSA.48.13	Mark ye well her bulwarks,
PSA.48.13	consider her palaces;
PSA.48.13	that ye may tell 
PSA.48.14	For this God 
PSA.48.14	he will be our guide 
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all 
PSA.49.1	give ear, all 
PSA.49.2	both low and high,
PSA.49.2	rich and poor, together.
PSA.49.3	My mouth shall speak of wisdom;
PSA.49.3	and the meditation of my heart 
PSA.49.4	I will incline mine ear to a parable:
PSA.49.4	I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
PSA.49.5	Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
PSA.49.6	They that trust in their wealth,
PSA.49.6	and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
PSA.49.7	none 
PSA.49.7	nor give to God a ransom for him:
PSA.49.8	(for the redemption of their soul 
PSA.49.8	and it ceaseth for ever:)
PSA.49.9	that he should still live for ever,
PSA.49.10	For he seeth 
PSA.49.10	likewise the fool and the brutish person perish,
PSA.49.10	and leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their inward thought 
PSA.49.11	they call 
PSA.49.12	Nevertheless man 
PSA.49.12	he is like the beasts 
PSA.49.13	This their way 
PSA.49.13	yet their posterity approve their sayings. 
PSA.49.14	Like sheep they are laid in the grave;
PSA.49.14	death shall feed on them;
PSA.49.14	and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;
PSA.49.14	and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
PSA.49.15	But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave:
PSA.49.15	for he shall receive me. 
PSA.49.16	Be not thou afraid when one is made rich,
PSA.49.16	when the glory of his house is increased;
PSA.49.17	for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away:
PSA.49.17	his glory shall not descend after him.
PSA.49.18	Though while he lived he blessed his soul,
PSA.49.18	(and 
PSA.49.19	he shall go to the generation of his fathers;
PSA.49.19	they shall never see light.
PSA.49.20	Man 
PSA.49.20	is like the beasts 
PSA.50.1	The mighty God, 
PSA.50.1	hath spoken, and called the earth
PSA.50.1	from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
PSA.50.2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
PSA.50.2	God hath shined.
PSA.50.3	Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence:
PSA.50.3	a fire shall devour before him,
PSA.50.3	and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
PSA.50.4	He shall call to the heavens from above,
PSA.50.4	and to the earth, that he may judge his people.
PSA.50.5	Gather my saints together unto me;
PSA.50.5	those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
PSA.50.6	And the heavens shall declare his righteousness:
PSA.50.6	for God 
PSA.50.7	Hear, O my people, and I will speak;
PSA.50.7	O Israel, and I will testify against thee:
PSA.50.7	I 
PSA.50.8	I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices
PSA.50.8	or thy burnt offerings, 
PSA.50.9	I will take no bullock out of thy house,
PSA.50.10	for every beast of the forest 
PSA.50.11	I know all the fowls of the mountains:
PSA.50.11	and the wild beasts of the field 
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell thee:
PSA.50.12	for the world 
PSA.50.13	Will I eat the flesh of bulls,
PSA.50.13	or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	Offer unto God thanksgiving;
PSA.50.14	and pay thy vows unto the Most High:
PSA.50.15	and call upon me in the day of trouble:
PSA.50.15	I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
PSA.50.16	But unto the wicked God saith,
PSA.50.16	What hast thou to do to declare my statutes,
PSA.50.16	or 
PSA.50.17	seeing thou hatest instruction,
PSA.50.17	and castest my words behind thee.
PSA.50.18	When thou sawest a thief,
PSA.50.18	then thou consentedst with him,
PSA.50.18	and hast been partaker with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	Thou givest thy mouth to evil,
PSA.50.19	and thy tongue frameth deceit.
PSA.50.20	Thou sittest 
PSA.50.20	thou slanderest thine own mother's son.
PSA.50.21	These 
PSA.50.21	thou thoughtest that I was altogether 
PSA.50.22	Now consider this, ye that forget God,
PSA.50.22	lest I tear 
PSA.50.23	Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me:
PSA.50.23	and to him that ordereth 
PSA.50.23	will I show the salvation of God.
PSA.51.1	Have mercy upon me, O God,
PSA.51.1	according to thy loving-kindness:
PSA.51.1	according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies
PSA.51.1	blot out my transgressions.
PSA.51.2	Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity,
PSA.51.2	and cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I acknowledge my transgressions:
PSA.51.3	and my sin 
PSA.51.4	and done 
PSA.51.4	that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
PSA.51.5	Behold, I was shapen in iniquity;
PSA.51.5	and in sin did my mother conceive me.
PSA.51.6	Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts:
PSA.51.6	and in the hidden 
PSA.51.7	Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean:
PSA.51.7	wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Make me to hear joy and gladness;
PSA.51.9	Hide thy face from my sins,
PSA.51.9	and blot out all mine iniquities.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a clean heart, O God;
PSA.51.10	and renew a right spirit within me.
PSA.51.11	Cast me not away from thy presence;
PSA.51.11	and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation;
PSA.51.12	and uphold me 
PSA.51.13	and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
PSA.51.14	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,
PSA.51.14	thou God of my salvation:
PSA.51.15	O Lord, open thou my lips;
PSA.51.15	and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
PSA.51.16	For thou desirest not sacrifice;
PSA.51.16	else would I give 
PSA.51.16	thou delightest not in burnt offering.
PSA.51.17	The sacrifices of God 
PSA.51.17	a broken and a contrite heart, O God,
PSA.51.17	thou wilt not despise.
PSA.51.18	Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:
PSA.51.18	build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
PSA.51.19	with burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
PSA.51.19	then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
PSA.52.1	Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man?
PSA.52.1	The goodness of God 
PSA.52.2	Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs;
PSA.52.2	like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
PSA.52.3	Thou lovest evil more than good;
PSA.52.4	Thou lovest all devouring words,
PSA.52.4	O 
PSA.52.5	God shall likewise destroy thee for ever,
PSA.52.5	he shall take thee away,
PSA.52.5	and pluck thee out of 
PSA.52.5	and root thee out of the land of the living. 
PSA.52.6	The righteous also shall see, and fear,
PSA.52.6	and shall laugh at him:
PSA.52.7	Lo, 
PSA.52.7	but trusted in the abundance of his riches,
PSA.52.8	But I 
PSA.52.8	I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will praise thee for ever,
PSA.52.9	because thou hast done 
PSA.52.9	and I will wait on thy name;
PSA.52.9	for 
PSA.53.1	Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity:
PSA.53.2	God looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
PSA.53.2	to see if there were 
PSA.53.3	Every one of them is gone back:
PSA.53.3	they are altogether become filthy;
PSA.53.4	Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?
PSA.53.4	who eat up my people 
PSA.53.4	they have not called upon God.
PSA.53.5	There were they in great fear, 
PSA.53.5	for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth 
PSA.53.5	thou hast put 
PSA.53.5	because God hath despised them.
PSA.53.6	Oh that the salvation of Israel 
PSA.53.6	When God bringeth back the captivity of his people,
PSA.53.6	Jacob shall rejoice, 
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God, by thy name,
PSA.54.1	and judge me by thy strength.
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God;
PSA.54.2	give ear to the words of my mouth.
PSA.54.3	For strangers are risen up against me,
PSA.54.3	and oppressors seek after my soul:
PSA.54.3	they have not set God before them. 
PSA.54.4	Behold, God 
PSA.54.4	the Lord 
PSA.54.5	He shall reward evil unto mine enemies:
PSA.54.5	cut them off in thy truth.
PSA.54.6	I will freely sacrifice unto thee:
PSA.54.6	I will praise thy name, O 
PSA.54.6	for 
PSA.54.7	For he hath delivered me out of all trouble:
PSA.54.7	and mine eye hath seen 
PSA.55.1	Give ear to my prayer, O God;
PSA.55.1	and hide not thyself from my supplication.
PSA.55.2	Attend unto me, and hear me:
PSA.55.2	I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
PSA.55.3	because of the voice of the enemy,
PSA.55.3	because of the oppression of the wicked:
PSA.55.3	for they cast iniquity upon me,
PSA.55.3	and in wrath they hate me.
PSA.55.4	My heart is sore pained within me:
PSA.55.4	and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
PSA.55.5	Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me,
PSA.55.5	and horror hath overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!
PSA.55.7	Lo, 
PSA.55.8	I would hasten my escape
PSA.55.8	from the windy storm 
PSA.55.9	Destroy, O Lord, 
PSA.55.9	for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
PSA.55.10	Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
PSA.55.10	mischief also and sorrow 
PSA.55.11	Wickedness 
PSA.55.11	deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
PSA.55.12	For 
PSA.55.12	then I could have borne 
PSA.55.12	neither 
PSA.55.12	then I would have hid myself from him:
PSA.55.13	but 
PSA.55.13	my guide, and mine acquaintance.
PSA.55.14	We took sweet counsel together,
PSA.55.15	Let death seize upon them,
PSA.55.15	for wickedness 
PSA.55.16	As for me, I will call upon God;
PSA.55.16	and the 
PSA.55.17	Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
PSA.55.17	and he shall hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He hath delivered my soul in peace
PSA.55.18	from the battle 
PSA.55.18	for there were many with me.
PSA.55.19	God shall hear, and afflict them,
PSA.55.19	even he that abideth of old. 
PSA.55.19	Because they have no changes,
PSA.55.19	therefore they fear not God.
PSA.55.20	He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him:
PSA.55.20	he hath broken his covenant.
PSA.55.21	but war 
PSA.55.21	his words were softer than oil,
PSA.55.21	yet 
PSA.55.22	Cast thy burden upon the 
PSA.55.22	and he shall sustain thee:
PSA.55.22	he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
PSA.55.23	But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
PSA.55.23	bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days;
PSA.55.23	but I will trust in thee.
PSA.56.1	Be merciful unto me, O God:
PSA.56.1	for man would swallow me up;
PSA.56.1	he fighting daily oppresseth me.
PSA.56.2	Mine enemies would daily swallow 
PSA.56.2	for 
PSA.56.3	What time I am afraid,
PSA.56.3	I will trust in thee.
PSA.56.4	In God I will praise his word,
PSA.56.4	in God I have put my trust;
PSA.56.4	I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
PSA.56.5	Every day they wrest my words:
PSA.56.5	all their thoughts 
PSA.56.6	They gather themselves together,
PSA.56.6	they hide themselves,
PSA.56.6	they mark my steps,
PSA.56.6	when they wait for my soul.
PSA.56.7	Shall they escape by iniquity?
PSA.56.7	In 
PSA.56.8	Thou tellest my wanderings:
PSA.56.8	put thou my tears into thy bottle:
PSA.56.9	When I cry 
PSA.56.9	then shall mine enemies turn back:
PSA.56.9	this I know; for God 
PSA.56.10	In God will I praise 
PSA.56.10	in the 
PSA.56.11	In God have I put my trust:
PSA.56.11	I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
PSA.56.12	Thy vows 
PSA.56.12	I will render praises unto thee.
PSA.56.13	For thou hast delivered my soul from death:
PSA.56.13	that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
PSA.57.1	Be merciful unto me, O God,
PSA.57.1	be merciful unto me:
PSA.57.1	for my soul trusteth in thee:
PSA.57.1	yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge,
PSA.57.1	until 
PSA.57.2	I will cry unto God most high;
PSA.57.2	unto God that performeth 
PSA.57.3	He shall send from heaven, and save me
PSA.57.3	God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
PSA.57.4	My soul 
PSA.57.4	and their tongue a sharp sword.
PSA.57.5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;
PSA.57.6	They have prepared a net for my steps;
PSA.57.6	my soul is bowed down:
PSA.57.6	they have digged a pit before me,
PSA.57.6	into the midst whereof they are fallen 
PSA.57.7	My heart is fixed, O God,
PSA.57.7	my heart is fixed:
PSA.57.7	I will sing and give praise.
PSA.57.8	Awake up, my glory;
PSA.57.8	awake, psaltery and harp:
PSA.57.8	I 
PSA.57.9	I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people:
PSA.57.9	I will sing unto thee among the nations.
PSA.57.10	For thy mercy 
PSA.57.10	and thy truth unto the clouds.
PSA.57.11	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:
PSA.58.1	Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation?
PSA.58.1	Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
PSA.58.2	Yea, in heart ye work wickedness;
PSA.58.2	ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
PSA.58.3	The wicked are estranged from the womb:
PSA.58.3	they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
PSA.58.4	Their poison 
PSA.58.5	which will not hearken to the voice of charmers,
PSA.58.5	charming never so wisely.
PSA.58.6	Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth:
PSA.58.6	break out the great teeth of the young lions, O 
PSA.58.7	Let them melt away as waters 
PSA.58.7	let them be as cut in pieces.
PSA.58.8	As a snail 
PSA.58.8	let 
PSA.58.9	Before your pots can feel the thorns,
PSA.58.9	he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in 
PSA.58.10	The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance:
PSA.58.10	he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	So that a man shall say, Verily 
PSA.58.11	verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God:
PSA.59.1	defend me from them that rise up against me.
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
PSA.59.2	and save me from bloody men.
PSA.59.3	For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul:
PSA.59.3	the mighty are gathered against me;
PSA.59.3	not 
PSA.59.3	nor 
PSA.59.4	They run and prepare themselves without 
PSA.59.4	Awake to help me,
PSA.59.5	Thou therefore, O 
PSA.59.5	awake to visit all the heathen:
PSA.59.5	be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. 
PSA.59.6	They return at evening:
PSA.59.6	they make a noise like a dog,
PSA.59.6	and go round about the city.
PSA.59.7	Behold, they belch out with their mouth:
PSA.59.7	swords 
PSA.59.7	for who, 
PSA.59.8	But thou, O 
PSA.59.8	thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
PSA.59.9	for God 
PSA.59.10	The God of my mercy shall prevent me:
PSA.59.10	God shall let me see 
PSA.59.11	Slay them not, lest my people forget:
PSA.59.11	scatter them by thy power;
PSA.59.11	and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
PSA.59.12	let them even be taken in their pride:
PSA.59.12	and for cursing and lying 
PSA.59.13	Consume 
PSA.59.13	that they 
PSA.59.13	and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob
PSA.59.13	unto the ends of the earth. 
PSA.59.14	And at evening let them return;
PSA.59.14	and go round about the city.
PSA.59.15	Let them wander up and down for meat,
PSA.59.15	and grudge if they be not satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing of thy power;
PSA.59.16	yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning:
PSA.59.16	for thou hast been my defense
PSA.59.16	and refuge in the day of my trouble.
PSA.59.17	Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing:
PSA.59.17	for God 
PSA.60.1	O God, thou hast cast us off,
PSA.60.1	thou has scattered us,
PSA.60.1	thou hast been displeased;
PSA.60.1	O turn thyself to us again.
PSA.60.2	Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it:
PSA.60.2	heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
PSA.60.3	Thou hast showed thy people hard things:
PSA.60.3	thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
PSA.60.4	Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee,
PSA.60.4	that it may be displayed because of the truth. 
PSA.60.5	That thy beloved may be delivered;
PSA.60.5	save 
PSA.60.6	God hath spoken in his holiness;
PSA.60.6	I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem,
PSA.60.6	and mete out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	Gil´e-ad 
PSA.60.7	E´phra-im also 
PSA.60.7	Judah 
PSA.60.8	Moab 
PSA.60.8	over Edom will I cast out my shoe:
PSA.60.8	Philis´ti-a, triumph thou because of me.
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me 
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me into Edom?
PSA.60.10	and 
PSA.60.11	Give us help from trouble:
PSA.60.11	for vain 
PSA.60.12	Through God we shall do valiantly:
PSA.60.12	for he 
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God;
PSA.61.1	attend unto my prayer.
PSA.61.2	From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee,
PSA.61.2	when my heart is overwhelmed.
PSA.61.2	Lead me to the rock 
PSA.61.3	for thou hast been a shelter for me,
PSA.61.4	I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever:
PSA.61.4	I will trust in the covert of thy wings. 
PSA.61.5	For thou, O God, hast heard my vows:
PSA.61.5	thou hast given 
PSA.61.6	Thou wilt prolong the king's life:
PSA.61.7	He shall abide before God for ever:
PSA.61.7	O prepare mercy and truth, 
PSA.61.8	So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever,
PSA.61.8	that I may daily perform my vows.
PSA.62.1	Truly my soul waiteth upon God:
PSA.62.1	from him 
PSA.62.2	He only 
PSA.62.3	How long will ye imagine mischief against a man?
PSA.62.3	Ye shall be slain all of you:
PSA.62.3	as a bowing wall 
PSA.62.4	They only consult to cast 
PSA.62.4	they delight in lies:
PSA.62.4	they bless with their mouth,
PSA.62.4	but they curse inwardly. 
PSA.62.5	My soul, wait thou only upon God;
PSA.62.5	for my expectation 
PSA.62.6	He only 
PSA.62.7	In God 
PSA.62.7	the rock of my strength, 
PSA.62.8	Trust in him at all times;
PSA.62.8	ye people, pour out your heart before him:
PSA.62.8	God 
PSA.62.9	Surely men of low degree 
PSA.62.9	to be laid in the balance,
PSA.62.9	they 
PSA.62.10	Trust not in oppression,
PSA.62.10	and become not vain in robbery:
PSA.62.10	if riches increase,
PSA.62.10	set not your heart 
PSA.62.11	God hath spoken once;
PSA.62.11	twice have I heard this;
PSA.62.11	that power 
PSA.62.12	for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
PSA.63.1	O God, thou 
PSA.63.1	early will I seek thee:
PSA.63.1	my soul thirsteth for thee,
PSA.63.1	my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land,
PSA.63.1	where no water is;
PSA.63.2	to see thy power and thy glory,
PSA.63.2	so 
PSA.63.3	Because thy loving-kindness 
PSA.63.3	my lips shall praise thee.
PSA.63.4	Thus will I bless thee while I live:
PSA.63.4	I will lift up my hands in thy name.
PSA.63.5	My soul shall be satisfied as 
PSA.63.5	and my mouth shall praise 
PSA.63.6	when I remember thee upon my bed,
PSA.63.7	Because thou hast been my help,
PSA.63.7	therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
PSA.63.8	My soul followeth hard after thee:
PSA.63.8	thy right hand upholdeth me.
PSA.63.9	But those 
PSA.63.9	shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
PSA.63.10	They shall fall by the sword:
PSA.63.10	they shall be a portion for foxes.
PSA.63.11	But the king shall rejoice in God;
PSA.63.11	every one that sweareth by him shall glory:
PSA.63.11	but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer:
PSA.64.1	preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked;
PSA.64.2	from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
PSA.64.3	who whet their tongue like a sword,
PSA.64.4	that they may shoot in secret at the perfect:
PSA.64.4	suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
PSA.64.5	They encourage themselves 
PSA.64.5	they commune of laying snares privily;
PSA.64.5	they say, Who shall see them?
PSA.64.6	They search out iniquities;
PSA.64.6	they accomplish a diligent search:
PSA.64.6	both the inward 
PSA.64.7	But God shall shoot at them 
PSA.64.7	suddenly shall they be wounded.
PSA.64.8	So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
PSA.64.8	all that see them shall flee away.
PSA.64.9	And all men shall fear,
PSA.64.9	and shall declare the work of God;
PSA.64.9	for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
PSA.64.10	The righteous shall be glad in the 
PSA.64.10	and shall trust in him;
PSA.64.10	and all the upright in heart shall glory.
PSA.65.1	Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion:
PSA.65.1	and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
PSA.65.2	O thou that hearest prayer,
PSA.65.2	unto thee shall all flesh come.
PSA.65.3	Iniquities prevail against me:
PSA.65.3	thou shalt purge them away.
PSA.65.4	Blessed 
PSA.65.4	and causest to approach 
PSA.65.4	we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house,
PSA.65.5	O God of our salvation;
PSA.65.5	and of them that are afar off 
PSA.65.6	which by his strength setteth fast the mountains;
PSA.65.7	which stilleth the noise of the seas,
PSA.65.7	the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
PSA.65.8	They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens:
PSA.65.8	thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
PSA.65.9	Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it:
PSA.65.9	thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, 
PSA.65.9	thou preparest them corn,
PSA.65.9	when thou hast so provided for it.
PSA.65.10	Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly:
PSA.65.10	thou settlest the furrows thereof:
PSA.65.10	thou makest it soft with showers:
PSA.65.10	thou blessest the springing thereof.
PSA.65.11	Thou crownest the year with thy goodness;
PSA.65.11	and thy paths drop fatness.
PSA.65.12	They drop 
PSA.65.12	and the little hills rejoice on every side.
PSA.65.13	The pastures are clothed with flocks;
PSA.65.13	the valleys also are covered over with corn;
PSA.65.13	they shout for joy, they also sing.
PSA.66.1	Make a joyful noise unto God,
PSA.66.1	all ye lands:
PSA.66.2	sing forth the honor of his name:
PSA.66.2	make his praise glorious.
PSA.66.3	Say unto God, How terrible 
PSA.66.3	Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
PSA.66.4	All the earth shall worship thee,
PSA.66.4	and shall sing unto thee;
PSA.66.4	they shall sing 
PSA.66.5	Come and see the works of God:
PSA.66.6	they went through the flood on foot:
PSA.66.6	there did we rejoice in him.
PSA.66.7	He ruleth by his power for ever;
PSA.66.7	his eyes behold the nations:
PSA.66.7	let not the rebellious exalt themselves. 
PSA.66.8	O bless our God, ye people,
PSA.66.8	and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
PSA.66.9	which holdeth our soul in life,
PSA.66.9	and suffereth not our feet to be moved.
PSA.66.10	For thou, O God, hast proved us:
PSA.66.10	thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
PSA.66.11	Thou broughtest us into the net;
PSA.66.11	thou laidst affliction upon our loins.
PSA.66.12	Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads;
PSA.66.12	we went through fire and through water:
PSA.66.12	but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy 
PSA.66.13	I will go into thy house with burnt offerings:
PSA.66.13	I will pay thee my vows,
PSA.66.14	which my lips have uttered,
PSA.66.14	and my mouth hath spoken,
PSA.66.14	when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings,
PSA.66.15	with the incense of rams:
PSA.66.15	I will offer bullocks with goats. 
PSA.66.16	Come 
PSA.66.16	and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
PSA.66.17	I cried unto him with my mouth,
PSA.66.17	and he was extolled with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I regard iniquity in my heart,
PSA.66.18	the Lord will not hear 
PSA.66.19	he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Blessed 
PSA.66.20	which hath not turned away my prayer,
PSA.66.20	nor his mercy from me.
PSA.67.1	God be merciful unto us, and bless us;
PSA.67.2	that thy way may be known upon earth,
PSA.67.2	thy saving health among all nations.
PSA.67.3	Let the people praise thee, O God;
PSA.67.3	let all the people praise thee.
PSA.67.4	O let the nations be glad and sing for joy:
PSA.67.4	for thou shalt judge the people righteously,
PSA.67.4	and govern the nations upon earth. 
PSA.67.5	Let the people praise thee, O God;
PSA.67.5	let all the people praise thee.
PSA.67.7	God shall bless us;
PSA.67.7	and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
PSA.68.1	Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered:
PSA.68.1	let them also that hate him flee before him.
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driven away, 
PSA.68.2	as wax melteth before the fire,
PSA.68.3	But let the righteous be glad;
PSA.68.3	let them rejoice before God:
PSA.68.3	yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.
PSA.68.4	Sing unto God, sing praises to his name:
PSA.68.4	extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name 
PSA.68.4	and rejoice before him.
PSA.68.5	A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows,
PSA.68.6	God setteth the solitary in families:
PSA.68.6	he bringeth out those which are bound with chains:
PSA.68.6	but the rebellious dwell in a dry 
PSA.68.7	O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people,
PSA.68.7	when thou didst march through the wilderness; 
PSA.68.8	at the presence of God:
PSA.68.9	Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain,
PSA.68.9	whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance,
PSA.68.9	when it was weary.
PSA.68.10	Thy congregation hath dwelt therein:
PSA.68.10	thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.
PSA.68.11	The Lord gave the word:
PSA.68.11	great 
PSA.68.12	Kings of armies did flee apace:
PSA.68.12	and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.
PSA.68.13	Though ye have lain among the pots,
PSA.68.13	and her feathers with yellow gold.
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered kings in it,
PSA.68.14	it was 
PSA.68.15	The hill of God 
PSA.68.15	a high hill 
PSA.68.16	Why leap ye, ye high hills?
PSA.68.16	yea, the 
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God 
PSA.68.17	the Lord 
PSA.68.18	thou hast led captivity captive:
PSA.68.18	thou hast received gifts for men;
PSA.68.18	yea, 
PSA.68.18	that the 
PSA.68.19	Blessed 
PSA.68.20	and unto 
PSA.68.21	But God shall wound the head of his enemies,
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan,
PSA.68.22	I will bring 
PSA.68.23	that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of 
PSA.68.24	They have seen thy goings, O God;
PSA.68.25	The singers went before, the players on instruments 
PSA.68.25	among 
PSA.68.26	Bless ye God in the congregations,
PSA.68.27	There 
PSA.68.27	the princes of Judah 
PSA.68.27	the princes of Zeb´ulun, 
PSA.68.28	Thy God hath commanded thy strength:
PSA.68.28	strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.
PSA.68.29	Because of thy temple at Jerusalem
PSA.68.29	shall kings bring presents unto thee.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the company of spearmen,
PSA.68.30	the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people,
PSA.68.30	scatter thou the people 
PSA.68.31	Princes shall come out of Egypt;
PSA.68.31	Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.
PSA.68.32	Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth;
PSA.68.32	O sing praises unto the Lord. 
PSA.68.33	To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens,
PSA.68.34	Ascribe ye strength unto God:
PSA.68.34	his excellency 
PSA.68.34	and his strength 
PSA.68.35	O God, 
PSA.68.35	the God of Israel 
PSA.68.35	Blessed 
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God;
PSA.69.1	for the waters are come in unto 
PSA.69.2	I sink in deep mire,
PSA.69.2	where 
PSA.69.2	I am come into deep waters,
PSA.69.2	where the floods overflow me.
PSA.69.3	I am weary of my crying:
PSA.69.3	my throat is dried:
PSA.69.3	mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
PSA.69.4	they that would destroy me, 
PSA.69.4	then I restored 
PSA.69.5	O God, thou knowest my foolishness;
PSA.69.5	and my sins are not hid from thee.
PSA.69.6	Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord 
PSA.69.6	let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
PSA.69.7	Because for thy sake I have borne reproach;
PSA.69.7	shame hath covered my face.
PSA.69.8	I am become a stranger unto my brethren,
PSA.69.8	and an alien unto my mother's children.
PSA.69.9	and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
PSA.69.10	When I wept, 
PSA.69.10	that was to my reproach.
PSA.69.11	I made sackcloth also my garment;
PSA.69.11	and I became a proverb to them.
PSA.69.12	They that sit in the gate speak against me;
PSA.69.12	and I 
PSA.69.13	But as for me, my prayer 
PSA.69.13	O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me,
PSA.69.13	in the truth of thy salvation.
PSA.69.14	Deliver me out of the mire,
PSA.69.14	and let me not sink:
PSA.69.14	let me be delivered from them that hate me,
PSA.69.14	and out of the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Let not the waterflood overflow me,
PSA.69.15	neither let the deep swallow me up,
PSA.69.15	and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
PSA.69.16	Hear me, O 
PSA.69.16	for thy loving-kindness 
PSA.69.16	turn unto me
PSA.69.16	according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
PSA.69.17	And hide not thy face from thy servant;
PSA.69.17	for I am in trouble:
PSA.69.17	hear me speedily.
PSA.69.18	Draw nigh unto my soul, 
PSA.69.18	deliver me because of mine enemies.
PSA.69.19	Thou hast known my reproach,
PSA.69.19	and my shame, and my dishonor:
PSA.69.19	mine adversaries 
PSA.69.20	Reproach hath broken my heart;
PSA.69.20	and I am full of heaviness:
PSA.69.20	and I looked 
PSA.69.20	and for comforters, but I found none.
PSA.69.21	and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	and 
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not;
PSA.69.23	and make their loins continually to shake.
PSA.69.24	Pour out thine indignation upon them,
PSA.69.24	and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
PSA.69.26	For they persecute 
PSA.69.26	and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
PSA.69.27	Add iniquity unto their iniquity:
PSA.69.27	and let them not come into thy righteousness.
PSA.69.28	and not be written with the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But I 
PSA.69.29	let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God with a song,
PSA.69.30	and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.32	The humble shall see 
PSA.69.32	and your heart shall live that seek God.
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.33	and despiseth not his prisoners.
PSA.69.34	Let the heaven and earth praise him,
PSA.69.34	the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
PSA.69.35	For God will save Zion,
PSA.69.35	and will build the cities of Judah:
PSA.69.35	that they may dwell there,
PSA.69.35	and have it in possession.
PSA.69.36	The seed also of his servants shall inherit it:
PSA.69.36	and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
PSA.70.1	make haste to help me, O 
PSA.70.2	Let them be ashamed and confounded
PSA.70.2	that seek after my soul:
PSA.70.2	let them be turned backward, and put to confusion,
PSA.70.2	that desire my hurt.
PSA.70.3	Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame
PSA.70.3	that say, Aha, aha.
PSA.70.4	Let all those that seek thee
PSA.70.4	rejoice and be glad in thee:
PSA.70.4	and let such as love thy salvation
PSA.70.4	say continually, Let God be magnified.
PSA.70.5	But I 
PSA.70.5	make haste unto me, O God:
PSA.70.5	thou 
PSA.70.5	O 
PSA.71.1	In thee, O 
PSA.71.1	let me never be put to confusion.
PSA.71.2	Deliver me in thy righteousness,
PSA.71.2	and cause me to escape:
PSA.71.2	incline thine ear unto me,
PSA.71.2	and save me.
PSA.71.3	Be thou my strong habitation,
PSA.71.3	whereunto I may continually resort:
PSA.71.3	thou hast given commandment to save me;
PSA.71.3	for thou 
PSA.71.4	Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
PSA.71.4	out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
PSA.71.5	For thou 
PSA.71.6	By thee have I been holden up from the womb:
PSA.71.6	thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels:
PSA.71.6	my praise 
PSA.71.7	I am as a wonder unto many;
PSA.71.7	but thou 
PSA.71.8	Let my mouth be filled 
PSA.71.9	Cast me not off in the time of old age;
PSA.71.9	forsake me not when my strength faileth.
PSA.71.10	For mine enemies speak against me;
PSA.71.10	and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
PSA.71.11	saying, God hath forsaken him:
PSA.71.11	persecute and take him;
PSA.71.11	for 
PSA.71.12	O God, be not far from me:
PSA.71.12	O my God, make haste for my help.
PSA.71.13	Let them be confounded 
PSA.71.13	let them be covered 
PSA.71.14	But I will hope continually,
PSA.71.14	and will yet praise thee more and more.
PSA.71.15	My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness
PSA.71.15	for I know not the numbers 
PSA.71.16	I will go in the strength of the Lord 
PSA.71.16	I will make mention of thy righteousness, 
PSA.71.17	O God, thou hast taught me from my youth:
PSA.71.17	and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
PSA.71.18	Now also when I am old and grayheaded,
PSA.71.18	O God, forsake me not;
PSA.71.18	until I have showed thy strength unto 
PSA.71.19	Thy righteousness also, O God, 
PSA.71.19	who hast done great things:
PSA.71.19	O God, who 
PSA.71.20	and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
PSA.71.21	Thou shalt increase my greatness,
PSA.71.21	and comfort me on every side.
PSA.71.22	I will also praise thee with the psaltery,
PSA.71.22	unto thee will I sing with the harp,
PSA.71.22	O thou Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee;
PSA.71.23	and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
PSA.71.24	My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:
PSA.71.24	for they are confounded,
PSA.71.24	for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
PSA.72.1	Give the king thy judgments, O God,
PSA.72.1	and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
PSA.72.2	He shall judge thy people with righteousness,
PSA.72.2	and thy poor with judgment.
PSA.72.3	The mountains shall bring peace to the people,
PSA.72.3	and the little hills, by righteousness.
PSA.72.4	He shall judge the poor of the people,
PSA.72.4	he shall save the children of the needy,
PSA.72.4	and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
PSA.72.5	They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
PSA.72.5	throughout all generations.
PSA.72.6	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass:
PSA.72.6	as showers 
PSA.72.7	In his days shall the righteous flourish;
PSA.72.7	and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
PSA.72.8	and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him;
PSA.72.9	and his enemies shall lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
PSA.72.10	the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
PSA.72.11	Yea, all kings shall fall down before him:
PSA.72.11	all nations shall serve him.
PSA.72.12	For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth;
PSA.72.12	the poor also, and 
PSA.72.13	He shall spare the poor and needy,
PSA.72.13	and shall save the souls of the needy.
PSA.72.14	He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence:
PSA.72.14	and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
PSA.72.15	And he shall live,
PSA.72.15	and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba:
PSA.72.15	prayer also shall be made for him continually;
PSA.72.16	There shall be a handful of corn in the earth
PSA.72.16	upon the top of the mountains;
PSA.72.16	the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon:
PSA.72.16	and 
PSA.72.17	His name shall endure for ever:
PSA.72.17	his name shall be continued as long as the sun:
PSA.72.17	and 
PSA.72.17	all nations shall call him blessed.
PSA.72.18	Blessed 
PSA.72.18	who only doeth wondrous things.
PSA.72.19	And blessed 
PSA.72.19	and let the whole earth be filled 
PSA.72.19	Amen, and Amen.
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
PSA.73.1	Truly God 
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet were almost gone;
PSA.73.2	my steps had well-nigh slipped.
PSA.73.3	For I was envious at the foolish,
PSA.73.4	For 
PSA.73.4	but their strength 
PSA.73.5	They 
PSA.73.5	neither are they plagued like 
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain;
PSA.73.6	violence covereth them 
PSA.73.7	Their eyes stand out with fatness:
PSA.73.7	they have more than heart could wish.
PSA.73.8	They are corrupt, and speak wickedly 
PSA.73.8	they speak loftily.
PSA.73.9	They set their mouth against the heavens,
PSA.73.9	and their tongue walketh through the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore his people return hither:
PSA.73.10	and waters of a full 
PSA.73.11	And they say, How doth God know?
PSA.73.11	And is there knowledge in the Most High?
PSA.73.12	Behold, these 
PSA.73.12	who prosper in the world;
PSA.73.12	they increase 
PSA.73.13	Verily I have cleansed my heart 
PSA.73.13	and washed my hands in innocency.
PSA.73.14	For all the day long have I been plagued,
PSA.73.14	and chastened every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I say, I will speak thus;
PSA.73.15	behold, I should offend 
PSA.73.16	When I thought to know this,
PSA.73.16	it 
PSA.73.17	until I went into the sanctuary of God;
PSA.73.18	Surely thou didst set them in slippery places:
PSA.73.18	thou castedst them down into destruction.
PSA.73.19	How are they 
PSA.73.19	They are utterly consumed with terrors.
PSA.73.20	As a dream when 
PSA.73.20	thou shalt despise their image.
PSA.73.21	Thus my heart was grieved,
PSA.73.21	and I was pricked in my reins.
PSA.73.22	So foolish 
PSA.73.22	I was 
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless I 
PSA.73.23	thou hast holden 
PSA.73.24	Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,
PSA.73.24	and afterward receive me 
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven 
PSA.73.25	And 
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart faileth:
PSA.73.26	and my portion for ever.
PSA.73.27	For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish:
PSA.73.27	thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
PSA.73.28	But 
PSA.73.28	I have put my trust in the Lord 
PSA.73.28	that I may declare all thy works.
PSA.74.1	O God, why hast thou cast 
PSA.74.2	Remember thy congregation,
PSA.74.2	the rod of thine inheritance,
PSA.74.2	this mount Zion,
PSA.74.2	wherein thou hast dwelt.
PSA.74.3	Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations;
PSA.74.4	Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations;
PSA.74.4	they set up their ensigns 
PSA.74.6	But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
PSA.74.7	They have cast fire into thy sanctuary,
PSA.74.7	they have defiled 
PSA.74.8	They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together:
PSA.74.8	they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
PSA.74.9	We see not our signs:
PSA.74.9	neither 
PSA.74.10	O God, how long shall the adversary reproach?
PSA.74.10	Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
PSA.74.11	Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand?
PSA.74.11	Pluck 
PSA.74.12	For God 
PSA.74.12	working salvation in the midst of the earth.
PSA.74.13	thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
PSA.74.15	Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood:
PSA.74.15	thou driedst up mighty rivers.
PSA.74.16	The day 
PSA.74.16	thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
PSA.74.17	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth:
PSA.74.17	thou hast made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember this, 
PSA.74.18	and 
PSA.74.19	O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude 
PSA.74.19	forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
PSA.74.20	Have respect unto the covenant:
PSA.74.20	for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
PSA.74.21	O let not the oppressed return ashamed:
PSA.74.21	let the poor and needy praise thy name.
PSA.74.22	Arise, O God, plead thine own cause:
PSA.74.22	remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
PSA.74.23	Forget not the voice of thine enemies:
PSA.74.23	the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
PSA.75.1	Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks,
PSA.75.1	for 
PSA.75.2	When I shall receive the congregation
PSA.75.2	I will judge uprightly.
PSA.75.3	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved:
PSA.75.3	I bear up the pillars of it. 
PSA.75.4	I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly:
PSA.75.4	and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
PSA.75.5	lift not up your horn on high:
PSA.75.5	speak 
PSA.75.6	For promotion 
PSA.75.6	nor from the west, nor from the south.
PSA.75.7	But God 
PSA.75.7	he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
PSA.75.8	For in the hand of the 
PSA.75.8	it is full of mixture;
PSA.75.8	and he poureth out of the same:
PSA.75.8	but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring 
PSA.75.9	But I will declare for ever;
PSA.75.9	I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off;
PSA.76.1	In Judah 
PSA.76.1	his name 
PSA.76.2	In Salem also is his tabernacle,
PSA.76.2	and his dwelling place in Zion.
PSA.76.3	There brake he the arrows of the bow,
PSA.76.3	the shield, and the sword, and the battle. 
PSA.76.4	Thou 
PSA.76.5	The stout-hearted are spoiled,
PSA.76.5	they have slept their sleep:
PSA.76.5	and none of the men of might have found their hands.
PSA.76.6	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
PSA.76.7	Thou, 
PSA.76.7	and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
PSA.76.8	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven;
PSA.76.8	the earth feared, and was still,
PSA.76.9	when God arose to judgment,
PSA.76.9	to save all the meek of the earth. 
PSA.76.10	Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee:
PSA.76.10	the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
PSA.76.11	Vow, and pay unto the 
PSA.76.11	let all that be round about him bring presents
PSA.76.11	unto him that ought to be feared.
PSA.76.12	He shall cut off the spirit of princes:
PSA.77.1	I cried unto God with my voice,
PSA.77.1	and he gave ear unto me.
PSA.77.2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord:
PSA.77.2	my sore ran in the night, and ceased not:
PSA.77.2	my soul refused to be comforted.
PSA.77.3	I remembered God, and was troubled:
PSA.77.3	I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. 
PSA.77.4	Thou holdest mine eyes waking:
PSA.77.4	I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
PSA.77.5	I have considered the days of old,
PSA.77.5	the years of ancient times.
PSA.77.6	I call to remembrance my song in the night:
PSA.77.6	I commune with mine own heart:
PSA.77.6	and my spirit made diligent search.
PSA.77.7	Will the Lord cast off for ever?
PSA.77.7	And will he be favorable no more?
PSA.77.8	Is his mercy clean gone for ever?
PSA.77.8	Doth 
PSA.77.9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
PSA.77.9	Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? 
PSA.77.10	And I said, This 
PSA.77.11	I will remember the works of the 
PSA.77.11	surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
PSA.77.12	I will meditate also of all thy work,
PSA.77.12	and talk of thy doings.
PSA.77.13	Thy way, O God, 
PSA.77.13	who 
PSA.77.14	Thou 
PSA.77.14	thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
PSA.77.15	Thou hast with 
PSA.77.15	the sons of Jacob and Joseph. 
PSA.77.16	The waters saw thee, O God,
PSA.77.16	the waters saw thee;
PSA.77.16	they were afraid:
PSA.77.16	the depths also were troubled.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured out water:
PSA.77.17	the skies sent out a sound:
PSA.77.17	thine arrows also went abroad.
PSA.77.18	The voice of thy thunder 
PSA.77.18	the lightnings lightened the world:
PSA.77.18	the earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	Thy way 
PSA.77.19	and thy path in the great waters,
PSA.77.19	and thy footsteps are not known.
PSA.77.20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock
PSA.77.20	by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	Give ear, O my people, 
PSA.78.1	incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
PSA.78.2	I will utter dark sayings of old:
PSA.78.3	which we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	and our fathers have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide 
PSA.78.4	showing to the generation to come
PSA.78.4	the praises of the 
PSA.78.4	and his wonderful works that he hath done.
PSA.78.5	For he established a testimony in Jacob,
PSA.78.5	and appointed a law in Israel,
PSA.78.5	which he commanded our fathers,
PSA.78.5	that they should make them known to their children:
PSA.78.6	that the generation to come might know 
PSA.78.7	that they might set their hope in God,
PSA.78.7	and not forget the works of God,
PSA.78.7	but keep his commandments:
PSA.78.8	and might not be as their fathers,
PSA.78.8	a stubborn and rebellious generation;
PSA.78.8	a generation 
PSA.78.8	and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
PSA.78.9	The children of E´phra-im,
PSA.78.9	turned back in the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They kept not the covenant of God,
PSA.78.10	and refused to walk in his law;
PSA.78.11	and forgat his works,
PSA.78.11	and his wonders that he had showed them.
PSA.78.12	in the land of Egypt, 
PSA.78.13	and he made the waters to stand as a heap.
PSA.78.14	and all the night with a light of fire.
PSA.78.15	and gave 
PSA.78.16	He brought streams also out of the rock,
PSA.78.16	and caused waters to run down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	And they sinned yet more against him
PSA.78.17	by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.
PSA.78.18	by asking meat for their lust.
PSA.78.19	Yea, they spake against God;
PSA.78.19	they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	Behold, he smote the rock,
PSA.78.20	that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed;
PSA.78.20	can he give bread also?
PSA.78.20	Can he provide flesh for his people?
PSA.78.21	Therefore the 
PSA.78.21	so a fire was kindled against Jacob,
PSA.78.21	and anger also came up against Israel;
PSA.78.22	because they believed not in God,
PSA.78.22	and trusted not in his salvation:
PSA.78.23	though he had commanded the clouds from above,
PSA.78.23	and opened the doors of heaven,
PSA.78.24	and had given them of the corn of heaven.
PSA.78.25	Man did eat angels' food:
PSA.78.25	he sent them meat to the full.
PSA.78.26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven:
PSA.78.26	and by his power he brought in the south wind.
PSA.78.27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust,
PSA.78.27	and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
PSA.78.28	and he let 
PSA.78.28	round about their habitations.
PSA.78.29	So they did eat, and were well filled:
PSA.78.29	for he gave them their own desire;
PSA.78.30	they were not estranged from their lust:
PSA.78.30	but while their meat 
PSA.78.31	the wrath of God came upon them,
PSA.78.31	and slew the fattest of them,
PSA.78.31	and smote down the chosen 
PSA.78.32	For all this they sinned still,
PSA.78.32	and believed not for his wondrous works.
PSA.78.33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,
PSA.78.33	and their years in trouble.
PSA.78.34	When he slew them, then they sought him:
PSA.78.34	and they returned and inquired early after God.
PSA.78.35	And they remembered that God 
PSA.78.35	and the high God their redeemer.
PSA.78.36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth,
PSA.78.36	and they lied unto him with their tongues.
PSA.78.37	neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
PSA.78.38	But he, 
PSA.78.38	and destroyed 
PSA.78.38	yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
PSA.78.38	and did not stir up all his wrath.
PSA.78.39	For he remembered that they 
PSA.78.39	a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
PSA.78.40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness,
PSA.78.41	Yea, they turned back and tempted God,
PSA.78.41	and limited the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They remembered not his hand,
PSA.78.43	how he had wrought his signs in Egypt,
PSA.78.43	and his wonders in the field of Zo´an:
PSA.78.44	and their floods, that they could not drink.
PSA.78.45	and frogs, which destroyed them.
PSA.78.46	and their labor unto the locust.
PSA.78.47	and their sycamore trees with frost.
PSA.78.48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail,
PSA.78.48	and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
PSA.78.49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger,
PSA.78.49	wrath, and indignation, and trouble,
PSA.78.49	by sending evil angels 
PSA.78.50	He made a way to his anger;
PSA.78.50	he spared not their soul from death,
PSA.78.50	but gave their life over to the pestilence;
PSA.78.51	the chief of 
PSA.78.52	and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
PSA.78.53	but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
PSA.78.55	and divided them an inheritance by line,
PSA.78.55	and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
PSA.78.56	and kept not his testimonies:
PSA.78.57	but turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
PSA.78.57	they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
PSA.78.58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
PSA.78.58	and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
PSA.78.59	When God heard 
PSA.78.59	and greatly abhorred Israel:
PSA.78.60	the tent 
PSA.78.61	and his glory into the enemy's hand.
PSA.78.62	He gave his people over also unto the sword;
PSA.78.62	and was wroth with his inheritance.
PSA.78.63	The fire consumed their young men;
PSA.78.63	and their maidens were not given to marriage.
PSA.78.64	Their priests fell by the sword;
PSA.78.64	and their widows made no lamentation.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,
PSA.78.66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts:
PSA.78.66	he put them to a perpetual reproach.
PSA.78.67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph,
PSA.78.67	and chose not the tribe of E´phra-im:
PSA.78.68	but chose the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	the mount Zion which he loved.
PSA.78.69	And he built his sanctuary like high 
PSA.78.69	like the earth which he hath established for ever.
PSA.78.70	and took him from the sheepfolds:
PSA.78.71	from following the ewes great with young
PSA.78.71	he brought him to feed Jacob his people,
PSA.78.71	and Israel his inheritance.
PSA.78.72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart;
PSA.78.72	and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
PSA.79.1	thy holy temple have they defiled;
PSA.79.1	they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
PSA.79.2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given 
PSA.79.2	the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
PSA.79.3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
PSA.79.3	and 
PSA.79.4	We are become a reproach to our neighbors,
PSA.79.4	a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
PSA.79.5	How long, 
PSA.79.5	Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
PSA.79.6	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,
PSA.79.6	and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
PSA.79.7	For they have devoured Jacob,
PSA.79.7	and laid waste his dwelling place.
PSA.79.8	O remember not against us former iniquities:
PSA.79.8	let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us;
PSA.79.8	for we are brought very low.
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God of our salvation,
PSA.79.9	for the glory of thy name:
PSA.79.9	and deliver us, and purge away our sins,
PSA.79.9	for thy name's sake.
PSA.79.10	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where 
PSA.79.10	Let him be known among the heathen in our sight
PSA.79.11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee;
PSA.79.11	according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
PSA.79.12	and render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom
PSA.79.12	their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
PSA.79.13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture
PSA.79.13	will give thee thanks for ever:
PSA.79.13	we will show forth thy praise to all generations.
PSA.80.1	thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;
PSA.80.1	thou that dwellest 
PSA.80.2	Before E´phra-im and Benjamin and Manas´seh
PSA.80.2	stir up thy strength,
PSA.80.2	and come 
PSA.80.3	Turn us again, O God,
PSA.80.3	and cause thy face to shine;
PSA.80.3	and we shall be saved.
PSA.80.4	O 
PSA.80.4	how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
PSA.80.5	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears;
PSA.80.5	and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
PSA.80.6	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors:
PSA.80.6	and our enemies laugh among themselves.
PSA.80.7	Turn us again, O God of hosts,
PSA.80.7	and cause thy face to shine;
PSA.80.7	and we shall be saved.
PSA.80.8	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt:
PSA.80.8	thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
PSA.80.9	Thou preparedst 
PSA.80.9	and didst cause it to take deep root,
PSA.80.9	and it filled the land.
PSA.80.10	The hills were covered with the shadow of it,
PSA.80.10	and the boughs thereof 
PSA.80.11	She sent out her boughs unto the sea,
PSA.80.11	and her branches unto the river.
PSA.80.12	Why hast thou 
PSA.80.12	so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
PSA.80.13	The boar out of the wood doth waste it,
PSA.80.13	and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
PSA.80.14	Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts:
PSA.80.14	look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
PSA.80.15	and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted,
PSA.80.15	and the branch 
PSA.80.16	they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
PSA.80.17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,
PSA.80.17	upon the son of man 
PSA.80.18	So will not we go back from thee:
PSA.80.18	quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
PSA.80.19	Turn us again, O 
PSA.80.19	cause thy face to shine;
PSA.80.19	and we shall be saved.
PSA.81.1	Sing aloud unto God our strength:
PSA.81.1	make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.2	Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel,
PSA.81.2	the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
PSA.81.3	in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
PSA.81.4	For this 
PSA.81.5	This he ordained in Joseph 
PSA.81.5	when he went out through the land of Egypt:
PSA.81.6	I removed his shoulder from the burden:
PSA.81.6	his hands were delivered from the pots.
PSA.81.7	I answered thee in the secret place of thunder:
PSA.81.7	I proved thee at the waters of Mer´ibah. 
PSA.81.8	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee:
PSA.81.8	O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
PSA.81.9	neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
PSA.81.10	I 
PSA.81.10	which brought thee out of the land of Egypt:
PSA.81.10	open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
PSA.81.11	But my people would not hearken to my voice;
PSA.81.11	and Israel would none of me.
PSA.81.12	So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust:
PSA.81.13	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me,
PSA.81.14	I should soon have subdued their enemies,
PSA.81.14	and turned my hand against their adversaries.
PSA.81.15	The haters of the 
PSA.81.15	but their time should have endured for ever.
PSA.81.16	He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat:
PSA.81.16	and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
PSA.82.1	God standeth in the congregation of the mighty;
PSA.82.1	he judgeth among the gods.
PSA.82.2	How long will ye judge unjustly,
PSA.82.2	and accept the persons of the wicked? 
PSA.82.3	Defend the poor and fatherless:
PSA.82.3	do justice to the afflicted and needy.
PSA.82.4	Deliver the poor and needy:
PSA.82.4	rid 
PSA.82.5	They know not, neither will they understand;
PSA.82.5	they walk on in darkness:
PSA.82.5	all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
PSA.82.6	and all of you 
PSA.82.7	But ye shall die like men,
PSA.82.7	and fall like one of the princes.
PSA.82.8	Arise, O God, judge the earth:
PSA.82.8	for thou shalt inherit all nations.
PSA.83.1	Keep not thou silence, O God:
PSA.83.1	hold not thy peace,
PSA.83.1	and be not still, O God.
PSA.83.2	For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult:
PSA.83.2	and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
PSA.83.3	They have taken crafty counsel against thy people,
PSA.83.3	and consulted against thy hidden ones.
PSA.83.4	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from 
PSA.83.4	that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
PSA.83.5	For they have consulted together with one consent:
PSA.83.5	they are confederate against thee:
PSA.83.6	the tabernacles of Edom, and the Ish´maelites;
PSA.83.6	of Moab, and the Hag´arenes;
PSA.83.7	Gebal, and Ammon, and Am´alek;
PSA.83.7	the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
PSA.83.8	Assyria also is joined with them:
PSA.83.8	they have helped the children of Lot. 
PSA.83.9	as 
PSA.83.10	they became 
PSA.83.11	yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmun´na:
PSA.83.12	who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
PSA.83.13	O my God, make them like a wheel;
PSA.83.13	as the stubble before the wind.
PSA.83.14	As the fire burneth a wood,
PSA.83.14	and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
PSA.83.15	so persecute them with thy tempest,
PSA.83.15	and make them afraid with thy storm.
PSA.83.16	Fill their faces with shame;
PSA.83.16	that they may seek thy name, O 
PSA.83.17	Let them be confounded and troubled for ever;
PSA.83.17	yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
PSA.83.18	that 
PSA.83.18	whose name alone 
PSA.84.1	How amiable 
PSA.84.2	My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the 
PSA.84.2	my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
PSA.84.3	Yea, the sparrow hath found a house,
PSA.84.3	and the swallow a nest for herself,
PSA.84.3	where she may lay her young,
PSA.84.3	my King, and my God.
PSA.84.4	Blessed 
PSA.84.4	they will be still praising thee. 
PSA.84.5	Blessed 
PSA.84.5	in whose heart 
PSA.84.6	the rain also filleth the pools.
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength,
PSA.84.8	O 
PSA.84.8	give ear, O God of Jacob. 
PSA.84.9	Behold, O God our shield,
PSA.84.9	and look upon the face of thine anointed.
PSA.84.10	For a day in thy courts 
PSA.84.10	I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,
PSA.84.10	than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.11	the 
PSA.84.11	no good 
PSA.84.12	O 
PSA.85.1	thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
PSA.85.2	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people;
PSA.85.2	thou hast covered all their sin. 
PSA.85.3	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath:
PSA.85.3	thou hast turned 
PSA.85.4	Turn us, O God of our salvation,
PSA.85.4	and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
PSA.85.5	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever?
PSA.85.5	Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
PSA.85.6	Wilt thou not revive us again:
PSA.85.6	that thy people may rejoice in thee?
PSA.85.7	Show us thy mercy, O 
PSA.85.7	and grant us thy salvation.
PSA.85.8	I will hear what God the 
PSA.85.8	for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints:
PSA.85.8	but let them not turn again to folly.
PSA.85.9	Surely his salvation 
PSA.85.9	that glory may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Mercy and truth are met together;
PSA.85.10	righteousness and peace have kissed 
PSA.85.11	Truth shall spring out of the earth;
PSA.85.11	and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	Yea, the 
PSA.85.12	and our land shall yield her increase.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness shall go before him;
PSA.85.13	and shall set 
PSA.86.1	Bow down thine ear, O 
PSA.86.1	hear me: for I 
PSA.86.2	Preserve my soul; for I 
PSA.86.2	O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
PSA.86.3	Be merciful unto me, O Lord:
PSA.86.3	for I cry unto thee daily.
PSA.86.4	Rejoice the soul of thy servant:
PSA.86.4	for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
PSA.86.5	For thou, Lord, 
PSA.86.5	and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
PSA.86.6	Give ear, O 
PSA.86.6	and attend to the voice of my supplications.
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee:
PSA.86.7	for thou wilt answer me.
PSA.86.8	Among the gods 
PSA.86.8	neither 
PSA.86.9	shall come and worship before thee, O Lord;
PSA.86.9	and shall glorify thy name.
PSA.86.10	For thou 
PSA.86.10	thou 
PSA.86.11	Teach me thy way, O 
PSA.86.11	I will walk in thy truth:
PSA.86.11	unite my heart to fear thy name.
PSA.86.12	I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart:
PSA.86.12	and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
PSA.86.13	For great 
PSA.86.13	and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
PSA.86.14	O God, the proud are risen against me,
PSA.86.14	and the assemblies of violent 
PSA.86.14	and have not set thee before them.
PSA.86.15	But thou, O Lord, 
PSA.86.15	long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
PSA.86.16	O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me;
PSA.86.16	give thy strength unto thy servant,
PSA.86.16	and save the son of thine handmaid.
PSA.86.17	Show me a token for good;
PSA.86.17	that they which hate me may see 
PSA.86.17	because thou, 
PSA.87.1	His foundation 
PSA.87.2	The 
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken of thee,
PSA.87.3	O city of God. 
PSA.87.4	I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
PSA.87.4	behold Philis´ti-a, and Tyre, with Ethiopia;
PSA.87.4	this 
PSA.87.5	And of Zion it shall be said,
PSA.87.5	This and that man was born in her:
PSA.87.5	and the Highest himself shall establish her.
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.7	As well the singers as the players on instruments 
PSA.87.7	all my springs 
PSA.88.1	O 
PSA.88.1	I have cried day 
PSA.88.2	let my prayer come before thee:
PSA.88.2	incline thine ear unto my cry;
PSA.88.3	for my soul is full of troubles:
PSA.88.3	and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
PSA.88.4	I am counted with them that go down into the pit:
PSA.88.4	I am as a man 
PSA.88.5	free among the dead,
PSA.88.5	like the slain that lie in the grave,
PSA.88.5	whom thou rememberest no more:
PSA.88.5	and they are cut off from thy hand.
PSA.88.6	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,
PSA.88.6	in darkness, in the deeps.
PSA.88.7	Thy wrath lieth hard upon me,
PSA.88.7	and thou hast afflicted 
PSA.88.8	Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me;
PSA.88.8	thou hast made me an abomination unto them:
PSA.88.9	Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction:
PSA.88.9	I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
PSA.88.10	Wilt thou show wonders to the dead?
PSA.88.10	Shall the dead arise 
PSA.88.11	Shall thy loving-kindness be declared in the grave?
PSA.88.12	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?
PSA.88.12	and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
PSA.88.13	But unto thee have I cried, O 
PSA.88.13	and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
PSA.88.15	I 
PSA.88.16	Thy fierce wrath goeth over me;
PSA.88.16	thy terrors have cut me off.
PSA.88.17	They came round about me daily like water;
PSA.88.17	they compassed me about together.
PSA.88.18	Lover and friend hast thou put far from me,
PSA.89.1	I will sing of the mercies of the 
PSA.89.1	with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
PSA.89.2	For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever:
PSA.89.2	thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
PSA.89.3	I have made a covenant with my chosen,
PSA.89.3	I have sworn unto David my servant,
PSA.89.4	and build up thy throne to all generations. 
PSA.89.5	And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O 
PSA.89.5	thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
PSA.89.6	For who in the heaven can be compared unto the 
PSA.89.7	God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints,
PSA.89.7	and to be had in reverence of all 
PSA.89.8	O 
PSA.89.8	who 
PSA.89.8	or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
PSA.89.9	Thou rulest the raging of the sea:
PSA.89.9	when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
PSA.89.10	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain;
PSA.89.10	thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
PSA.89.11	The heavens 
PSA.89.11	the earth also 
PSA.89.11	thou hast founded them.
PSA.89.12	The north and the south thou hast created them:
PSA.89.12	Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
PSA.89.13	Thou hast a mighty arm:
PSA.89.13	strong is thy hand,
PSA.89.14	Justice and judgment 
PSA.89.14	mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
PSA.89.15	Blessed 
PSA.89.15	they shall walk, O 
PSA.89.16	In thy name shall they rejoice all the day:
PSA.89.16	and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
PSA.89.17	For thou 
PSA.89.17	and in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.
PSA.89.18	For the 
PSA.89.18	and the Holy One of Israel 
PSA.89.19	Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst,
PSA.89.19	I have laid help upon 
PSA.89.19	I have exalted 
PSA.89.20	with my holy oil have I anointed him:
PSA.89.21	with whom my hand shall be established:
PSA.89.21	mine arm also shall strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	The enemy shall not exact upon him;
PSA.89.22	nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
PSA.89.23	And I will beat down his foes before his face,
PSA.89.23	and plague them that hate him.
PSA.89.24	But my faithfulness and my mercy 
PSA.89.24	and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
PSA.89.25	I will set his hand also in the sea,
PSA.89.25	and his right hand in the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He shall cry unto me, Thou 
PSA.89.26	my God, and the rock of my salvation.
PSA.89.27	higher than the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,
PSA.89.28	and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
PSA.89.29	His seed also will I make 
PSA.89.29	and his throne as the days of heaven.
PSA.89.30	If his children forsake my law,
PSA.89.30	and walk not in my judgments;
PSA.89.31	if they break my statutes,
PSA.89.31	and keep not my commandments;
PSA.89.32	then will I visit their transgression with the rod,
PSA.89.32	and their iniquity with stripes.
PSA.89.33	Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him,
PSA.89.33	nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
PSA.89.34	My covenant will I not break,
PSA.89.34	nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
PSA.89.35	Once have I sworn by my holiness
PSA.89.35	that I will not lie unto David.
PSA.89.36	His seed shall endure for ever,
PSA.89.36	and his throne as the sun before me.
PSA.89.37	It shall be established for ever as the moon,
PSA.89.37	and 
PSA.89.38	But thou hast cast off and abhorred,
PSA.89.38	thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
PSA.89.39	Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant:
PSA.89.39	thou hast profaned his crown 
PSA.89.40	Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
PSA.89.40	thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
PSA.89.41	All that pass by the way spoil him:
PSA.89.41	he is a reproach to his neighbors.
PSA.89.42	Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries;
PSA.89.42	thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
PSA.89.43	Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword,
PSA.89.43	and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
PSA.89.44	Thou hast made his glory to cease,
PSA.89.44	and cast his throne down to the ground.
PSA.89.45	The days of his youth hast thou shortened:
PSA.89.45	thou hast covered him with shame. 
PSA.89.46	How long, 
PSA.89.46	Wilt thou hide thyself for ever?
PSA.89.46	Shall thy wrath burn like fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember how short my time is:
PSA.89.47	wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
PSA.89.48	What man 
PSA.89.48	Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?
PSA.89.49	Lord, where 
PSA.89.50	Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants;
PSA.89.51	wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O 
PSA.89.51	wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
PSA.89.52	Blessed 
PSA.89.52	Amen, and Amen.
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were brought forth,
PSA.90.2	or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
PSA.90.2	even from everlasting to everlasting, thou 
PSA.90.3	Thou turnest man to destruction;
PSA.90.3	and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
PSA.90.4	and 
PSA.90.5	Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are 
PSA.90.5	in the morning 
PSA.90.6	In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
PSA.90.6	in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
PSA.90.7	For we are consumed by thine anger,
PSA.90.7	and by thy wrath are we troubled.
PSA.90.8	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
PSA.90.8	our secret 
PSA.90.9	For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
PSA.90.9	we spend our years as a tale 
PSA.90.10	The days of our years 
PSA.90.10	and if by reason of strength 
PSA.90.10	yet 
PSA.90.10	for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	Who knoweth the power of thine anger?
PSA.90.11	Even according to thy fear, 
PSA.90.12	So teach 
PSA.90.12	that we may apply 
PSA.90.13	Return, O 
PSA.90.13	And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
PSA.90.14	O satisfy us early with thy mercy;
PSA.90.14	that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
PSA.90.15	Make us glad according to the days 
PSA.90.16	Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
PSA.90.16	and thy glory unto their children.
PSA.90.17	And let the beauty of the 
PSA.90.17	and establish thou the work of our hands upon us;
PSA.90.17	yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
PSA.91.1	He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High
PSA.91.1	shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	I will say of the 
PSA.91.2	my God; in him will I trust.
PSA.91.3	Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
PSA.91.4	He shall cover thee with his feathers,
PSA.91.4	and under his wings shalt thou trust:
PSA.91.4	his truth 
PSA.91.5	Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night;
PSA.91.7	A thousand shall fall at thy side,
PSA.91.7	and ten thousand at thy right hand;
PSA.91.8	Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold
PSA.91.8	and see the reward of the wicked.
PSA.91.9	Because thou hast made the 
PSA.91.10	there shall no evil befall thee,
PSA.91.10	neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
PSA.91.11	to keep thee in all thy ways.
PSA.91.12	lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
PSA.91.13	the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
PSA.91.14	Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
PSA.91.14	I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
PSA.91.15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him:
PSA.91.15	I 
PSA.91.15	I will deliver him, and honor him.
PSA.91.16	With long life will I satisfy him,
PSA.91.16	and show him my salvation.
PSA.92.1	and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High:
PSA.92.2	to show forth thy loving-kindness in the morning,
PSA.92.2	and thy faithfulness every night,
PSA.92.3	upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery;
PSA.92.3	upon the harp with a solemn sound.
PSA.92.4	For thou, 
PSA.92.4	I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
PSA.92.5	O 
PSA.92.6	A brutish man knoweth not;
PSA.92.6	neither doth a fool understand this.
PSA.92.7	When the wicked spring as the grass,
PSA.92.7	and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;
PSA.92.8	but thou, 
PSA.92.9	For, lo, thine enemies, O 
PSA.92.9	for, lo, thine enemies shall perish;
PSA.92.9	all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
PSA.92.10	But my horn shalt thou exalt like 
PSA.92.10	I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
PSA.92.11	Mine eye also shall see 
PSA.92.12	The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree:
PSA.92.12	he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	Those that be planted in the house of the 
PSA.92.13	shall flourish in the courts of our God.
PSA.92.14	They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;
PSA.92.14	they shall be fat and flourishing;
PSA.92.15	to show that the 
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.1	the 
PSA.93.1	the world also is stablished,
PSA.93.1	that it cannot be moved.
PSA.93.2	Thy throne 
PSA.93.2	thou 
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up, O 
PSA.93.3	the floods have lifted up their voice;
PSA.93.3	the floods lift up their waves.
PSA.93.4	The 
PSA.93.5	Thy testimonies are very sure:
PSA.93.5	holiness becometh thine house,
PSA.93.5	O 
PSA.94.1	O 
PSA.94.1	O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, show thyself.
PSA.94.2	Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth:
PSA.94.2	render a reward to the proud.
PSA.94.3	how long shall the wicked triumph?
PSA.94.5	They break in pieces thy people, O 
PSA.94.5	and afflict thine heritage.
PSA.94.6	They slay the widow and the stranger,
PSA.94.6	and murder the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	Yet they say, The 
PSA.94.7	neither shall the God of Jacob regard 
PSA.94.8	Understand, ye brutish among the people:
PSA.94.8	and 
PSA.94.9	He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?
PSA.94.9	He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
PSA.94.10	He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct?
PSA.94.10	He that teacheth man knowledge, 
PSA.94.11	that they 
PSA.94.12	Blessed 
PSA.94.12	and teachest him out of thy law;
PSA.94.13	that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
PSA.94.13	until the pit be digged for the wicked.
PSA.94.14	For the 
PSA.94.14	neither will he forsake his inheritance.
PSA.94.15	But judgment shall return unto righteousness:
PSA.94.15	and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
PSA.94.16	Who will rise up for me against the evildoers?
PSA.94.17	Unless the 
PSA.94.17	my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
PSA.94.18	When I said, My foot slippeth;
PSA.94.18	thy mercy, O 
PSA.94.19	In the multitude of my thoughts within me
PSA.94.19	thy comforts delight my soul.
PSA.94.20	Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee,
PSA.94.20	which frameth mischief by a law?
PSA.94.21	They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
PSA.94.21	and condemn the innocent blood.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.22	and my God 
PSA.94.23	And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity,
PSA.94.23	and shall cut them off in their own wickedness;

PSA.95.10	Forty years long was I grieved with 
PSA.95.10	and said, It 
PSA.95.10	and they have not known my ways:
PSA.95.11	that they should not enter into my rest.

PSA.101.3	I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes:
PSA.101.3	I hate the work of them that turn aside;
PSA.101.4	A froward heart shall depart from me:
PSA.101.4	I will not know a wicked 
PSA.101.5	Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off:
PSA.101.5	him that hath a high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
PSA.101.6	Mine eyes 
PSA.101.6	that they may dwell with me:
PSA.101.6	he that walketh in a perfect way,
PSA.101.6	he shall serve me.
PSA.101.7	He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house:
PSA.101.7	he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
PSA.101.8	I will early destroy all the wicked of the land;
PSA.101.8	that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the 
PSA.102.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.102.1	and let my cry come unto thee.
PSA.102.2	Hide not thy face from me
PSA.102.2	in the day 
PSA.102.2	incline thine ear unto me:
PSA.102.2	in the day 
PSA.102.3	For my days are consumed like smoke,
PSA.102.3	and my bones are burned as a hearth.
PSA.102.4	My heart is smitten, and withered like grass;
PSA.102.4	so that I forget to eat my bread.
PSA.102.5	By reason of the voice of my groaning
PSA.102.5	my bones cleave to my skin.
PSA.102.6	I am like a pelican of the wilderness:
PSA.102.6	I am like an owl of the desert.
PSA.102.7	I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop.
PSA.102.8	Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
PSA.102.9	For I have eaten ashes like bread,
PSA.102.9	and mingled my drink with weeping,
PSA.102.10	because of thine indignation and thy wrath:
PSA.102.10	for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
PSA.102.11	My days 
PSA.102.11	and I am withered like grass.
PSA.102.12	But thou, O 
PSA.102.12	and thy remembrance unto all generations.
PSA.102.13	Thou shalt arise, 
PSA.102.13	for the time to favor her, yea, the set time, is come.
PSA.102.14	For thy servants take pleasure in her stones,
PSA.102.14	and favor the dust thereof.
PSA.102.15	So the heathen shall fear the name of the 
PSA.102.15	and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
PSA.102.16	When the 
PSA.102.16	he shall appear in his glory.
PSA.102.17	He will regard the prayer of the destitute,
PSA.102.17	and not despise their prayer.
PSA.102.18	This shall be written for the generation to come:
PSA.102.18	and the people which shall be created shall praise the 
PSA.102.19	For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
PSA.102.19	from heaven did the 
PSA.102.20	to hear the groaning of the prisoner;
PSA.102.20	to loose those that are appointed to death;
PSA.102.21	to declare the name of the 
PSA.102.21	and his praise in Jerusalem;
PSA.102.22	when the people are gathered together,
PSA.102.22	and the kingdoms, to serve the 
PSA.102.23	He weakened my strength in the way;
PSA.102.23	he shortened my days.
PSA.102.24	I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
PSA.102.24	thy years 
PSA.102.25	and the heavens 
PSA.102.26	They shall perish, but thou shalt endure:
PSA.102.26	yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
PSA.102.26	as a vesture shalt thou change them,
PSA.102.26	and they shall be changed:
PSA.102.27	but thou 
PSA.102.27	and thy years shall have no end.
PSA.102.28	The children of thy servants shall continue,
PSA.102.28	and their seed shall be established before thee.
PSA.103.1	Bless the 
PSA.103.1	and all that is within me, 
PSA.103.2	Bless the 
PSA.103.2	and forget not all his benefits:
PSA.103.3	who forgiveth all thine iniquities;
PSA.103.3	who healeth all thy diseases;
PSA.103.4	who redeemeth thy life from destruction;
PSA.103.4	who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies;
PSA.103.5	who satisfieth thy mouth with good 
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.6	and judgment for all that are oppressed.
PSA.103.7	He made known his ways unto Moses,
PSA.103.7	his acts unto the children of Israel.
PSA.103.8	slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
PSA.103.9	He will not always chide:
PSA.103.9	neither will he keep 
PSA.103.10	He hath not dealt with us after our sins;
PSA.103.10	nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
PSA.103.11	For as the heaven is high above the earth,
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west,
PSA.103.13	Like as a father pitieth 
PSA.103.14	For he knoweth our frame;
PSA.103.14	he remembereth that we 
PSA.103.15	as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
PSA.103.16	For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
PSA.103.16	and the place thereof shall know it no more.
PSA.103.17	But the mercy of the 
PSA.103.17	upon them that fear him,
PSA.103.17	and his righteousness unto children's children;
PSA.103.18	to such as keep his covenant,
PSA.103.18	and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
PSA.103.19	The 
PSA.103.19	and his kingdom ruleth over all.
PSA.103.20	Bless the 
PSA.103.20	that excel in strength,
PSA.103.20	that do his commandments,
PSA.103.20	hearkening unto the voice of his word.
PSA.103.21	Bless ye the 
PSA.103.22	Bless the 
PSA.103.22	in all places of his dominion:
PSA.103.22	bless the 
PSA.104.1	Bless the 
PSA.104.1	O 
PSA.104.1	thou art clothed with honor and majesty:
PSA.104.2	who coverest 
PSA.104.2	who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
PSA.104.3	who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters:
PSA.104.3	who maketh the clouds his chariot:
PSA.104.3	who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
PSA.104.4	his ministers a flaming fire:
PSA.104.6	Thou coveredst it with the deep as 
PSA.104.6	the waters stood above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At thy rebuke they fled;
PSA.104.7	at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
PSA.104.8	They go up by the mountains;
PSA.104.8	they go down by the valleys
PSA.104.8	unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
PSA.104.9	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;
PSA.104.9	that they turn not again to cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	He sendeth the springs into the valleys,
PSA.104.11	They give drink to every beast of the field:
PSA.104.11	the wild asses quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
PSA.104.13	He watereth the hills from his chambers:
PSA.104.13	the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
PSA.104.14	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
PSA.104.14	and herb for the service of man:
PSA.104.14	that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
PSA.104.15	and wine 
PSA.104.15	and bread 
PSA.104.16	The trees of the 
PSA.104.16	the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
PSA.104.17	where the birds make their nests:
PSA.104.18	The high hills 
PSA.104.19	He appointed the moon for seasons:
PSA.104.19	the sun knoweth his going down.
PSA.104.20	Thou makest darkness, and it is night:
PSA.104.20	wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep 
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar after their prey,
PSA.104.21	and seek their meat from God.
PSA.104.22	The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together,
PSA.104.22	and lay them down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Man goeth forth unto his work
PSA.104.23	and to his labor until the evening.
PSA.104.24	O 
PSA.104.24	In wisdom hast thou made them all:
PSA.104.24	the earth is full of thy riches.
PSA.104.25	wherein 
PSA.104.25	both small and great beasts.
PSA.104.27	These wait all upon thee;
PSA.104.27	that thou mayest give 
PSA.104.28	thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
PSA.104.29	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled:
PSA.104.29	thou takest away their breath, they die,
PSA.104.29	and return to their dust.
PSA.104.30	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created:
PSA.104.30	and thou renewest the face of the earth.
PSA.104.31	The glory of the 
PSA.104.31	the 
PSA.104.32	He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth:
PSA.104.32	he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing unto the 
PSA.104.33	I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
PSA.104.34	My meditation of him shall be sweet:
PSA.104.34	I will be glad in the 
PSA.104.35	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth,
PSA.104.35	and let the wicked be no more.
PSA.104.35	Bless thou the 
PSA.104.35	Praise ye the 
PSA.105.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.105.1	call upon his name:
PSA.105.1	make known his deeds among the people.
PSA.105.2	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him:
PSA.105.2	talk ye of all his wondrous works.
PSA.105.3	Glory ye in his holy name:
PSA.105.3	let the heart of them rejoice
PSA.105.3	that seek the 
PSA.105.4	Seek the 
PSA.105.4	seek his face evermore.
PSA.105.5	Remember his marvelous works that he hath done;
PSA.105.5	his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
PSA.105.6	O ye seed of Abraham his servant,
PSA.105.6	ye children of Jacob his chosen.
PSA.105.7	He 
PSA.105.7	his judgments 
PSA.105.8	He hath remembered his covenant for ever,
PSA.105.8	the word 
PSA.105.9	and his oath unto Isaac;
PSA.105.11	saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
PSA.105.11	the lot of your inheritance.
PSA.105.12	When they were 
PSA.105.12	yea, very few, and strangers in it;
PSA.105.13	when they went from one nation to another,
PSA.105.13	from 
PSA.105.14	yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
PSA.105.15	and do my prophets no harm.
PSA.105.16	he brake the whole staff of bread.
PSA.105.18	he was laid in iron:
PSA.105.19	until the time that his word came:
PSA.105.19	the word of the 
PSA.105.20	and let him go free.
PSA.105.21	and ruler of all his substance:
PSA.105.22	to bind his princes at his pleasure;
PSA.105.22	and teach his senators wisdom.
PSA.105.23	and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	and made them stronger than their enemies.
PSA.105.25	He turned their heart to hate his people,
PSA.105.25	to deal subtilely with his servants.
PSA.105.27	They showed his signs among them,
PSA.105.27	and wonders in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	and they rebelled not against his word.
PSA.105.29	and slew their fish.
PSA.105.30	in the chambers of their kings.
PSA.105.33	He smote their vines also and their fig trees;
PSA.105.33	and brake the trees of their coasts.
PSA.105.34	and caterpillars, and that without number,
PSA.105.35	and did eat up all the herbs in their land,
PSA.105.35	and devoured the fruit of their ground.
PSA.105.36	the chief of all their strength.
PSA.105.37	and 
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they departed:
PSA.105.38	for the fear of them fell upon them.
PSA.105.39	and fire to give light in the night.
PSA.105.40	and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
PSA.105.41	they ran in the dry places 
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his holy promise,
PSA.105.43	And he brought forth his people with joy,
PSA.105.44	and they inherited the labor of the people;
PSA.105.45	that they might observe his statutes,
PSA.105.45	and keep his laws.
PSA.105.45	Praise ye the 
PSA.106.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.106.1	for his mercy 
PSA.106.2	Who can utter the mighty acts of the 
PSA.106.3	Blessed 
PSA.106.4	Remember me, O 
PSA.106.4	with the favor 
PSA.106.4	O visit me with thy salvation;
PSA.106.5	that I may see the good of thy chosen,
PSA.106.5	that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation,
PSA.106.5	that I may glory with thine inheritance.
PSA.106.6	We have sinned with our fathers,
PSA.106.6	we have committed iniquity,
PSA.106.6	we have done wickedly.
PSA.106.7	they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies;
PSA.106.7	but provoked 
PSA.106.8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake,
PSA.106.8	that he might make his mighty power to be known.
PSA.106.9	and it was dried up:
PSA.106.9	so he led them through the depths,
PSA.106.9	as through the wilderness.
PSA.106.10	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated 
PSA.106.10	and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
PSA.106.11	And the waters covered their enemies:
PSA.106.11	there was not one of them left.
PSA.106.12	they sang his praise.
PSA.106.13	They soon forgat his works;
PSA.106.13	they waited not for his counsel:
PSA.106.14	and tempted God in the desert.
PSA.106.15	And he gave them their request;
PSA.106.15	but sent leanness into their soul.
PSA.106.17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
PSA.106.17	and covered the company of Abi´ram.
PSA.106.18	And a fire was kindled in their company;
PSA.106.18	the flame burned up the wicked.
PSA.106.19	and worshipped the molten image.
PSA.106.20	Thus they changed their glory
PSA.106.20	into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgat God their saviour,
PSA.106.21	which had done great things in Egypt;
PSA.106.22	wondrous works in the land of Ham,
PSA.106.23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them,
PSA.106.23	had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach,
PSA.106.23	to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy 
PSA.106.24	they believed not his word:
PSA.106.25	but murmured in their tents,
PSA.106.26	Therefore he lifted up his hand against them,
PSA.106.26	to overthrow them in the wilderness:
PSA.106.27	and to scatter them in the lands.
PSA.106.28	and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
PSA.106.29	Thus they provoked 
PSA.106.29	and the plague brake in upon them.
PSA.106.30	Then stood up Phin´ehas, and executed judgment:
PSA.106.30	and 
PSA.106.31	And that was counted unto him for righteousness
PSA.106.31	unto all generations for evermore.
PSA.106.32	so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
PSA.106.33	because they provoked his spirit,
PSA.106.33	so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
PSA.106.34	concerning whom the 
PSA.106.35	but were mingled among the heathen,
PSA.106.35	and learned their works.
PSA.106.36	And they served their idols:
PSA.106.36	which were a snare unto them.
PSA.106.37	and their daughters unto devils,
PSA.106.38	whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan:
PSA.106.38	and the land was polluted with blood.
PSA.106.39	Thus were they defiled with their own works,
PSA.106.39	and went a whoring with their own inventions.
PSA.106.40	insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
PSA.106.41	And he gave them into the hand of the heathen;
PSA.106.41	and they that hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies also oppressed them,
PSA.106.42	and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
PSA.106.43	Many times did he deliver them;
PSA.106.43	but they provoked 
PSA.106.43	and were brought low for their iniquity.
PSA.106.44	Nevertheless he regarded their affliction,
PSA.106.44	when he heard their cry:
PSA.106.45	and he remembered for them his covenant,
PSA.106.45	and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
PSA.106.46	He made them also to be pitied
PSA.106.46	of all those that carried them captives.
PSA.106.47	and gather us from among the heathen,
PSA.106.47	to give thanks unto thy holy name,
PSA.106.48	Blessed 
PSA.106.48	from everlasting to everlasting:
PSA.106.48	and let all the people say, Amen.
PSA.106.48	Praise ye the 
PSA.107.1	for his mercy 
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the 
PSA.107.2	whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
PSA.107.3	and gathered them out of the lands,
PSA.107.3	from the east, and from the west,
PSA.107.3	from the north, and from the south.
PSA.107.4	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way;
PSA.107.4	they found no city to dwell in.
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty,
PSA.107.5	their soul fainted in them.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.7	And he led them forth by the right way,
PSA.107.7	that they might go to a city of habitation.
PSA.107.8	Oh that 
PSA.107.8	and 
PSA.107.9	For he satisfieth the longing soul,
PSA.107.9	and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
PSA.107.10	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
PSA.107.11	because they rebelled against the words of God,
PSA.107.11	and contemned the counsel of the Most High:
PSA.107.12	therefore he brought down their heart with labor;
PSA.107.12	they fell down, and 
PSA.107.13	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
PSA.107.14	and brake their bands in sunder.
PSA.107.15	Oh that 
PSA.107.15	and 
PSA.107.16	For he hath broken the gates of brass,
PSA.107.16	and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
PSA.107.17	Fools, because of their transgression,
PSA.107.17	and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
PSA.107.18	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat;
PSA.107.18	and they draw near unto the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cry unto the 
PSA.107.20	He sent his word, and healed them,
PSA.107.20	and delivered 
PSA.107.21	Oh that 
PSA.107.21	and 
PSA.107.22	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
PSA.107.22	and declare his works with rejoicing.
PSA.107.23	They that go down to the sea in ships,
PSA.107.23	that do business in great waters;
PSA.107.24	these see the works of the 
PSA.107.24	and his wonders in the deep.
PSA.107.25	For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
PSA.107.25	which lifteth up the waves thereof.
PSA.107.26	They mount up to the heaven,
PSA.107.26	they go down again to the depths:
PSA.107.26	their soul is melted because of trouble.
PSA.107.27	They reel to and fro,
PSA.107.27	and stagger like a drunken man,
PSA.107.27	and are at their wit's end.
PSA.107.28	Then they cry unto the 
PSA.107.28	and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.29	He maketh the storm a calm,
PSA.107.29	so that the waves thereof are still.
PSA.107.30	Then are they glad because they be quiet;
PSA.107.30	so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
PSA.107.31	Oh that 
PSA.107.31	and 
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people,
PSA.107.32	and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
PSA.107.33	and the watersprings into dry ground;
PSA.107.34	a fruitful land into barrenness,
PSA.107.34	for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
PSA.107.35	He turneth the wilderness into a standing water,
PSA.107.35	and dry ground into watersprings.
PSA.107.36	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell,
PSA.107.36	that they may prepare a city for habitation;
PSA.107.37	and sow the fields, and plant vineyards,
PSA.107.37	which may yield fruits of increase.
PSA.107.38	He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
PSA.107.38	and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
PSA.107.39	Again, they are minished and brought low
PSA.107.39	through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
PSA.107.40	He poureth contempt upon princes,
PSA.107.40	and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, 
PSA.107.41	Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction,
PSA.107.41	and maketh 
PSA.107.42	The righteous shall see 
PSA.107.42	and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
PSA.107.43	Whoso 
PSA.107.43	even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the 
PSA.108.1	O God, my heart is fixed;
PSA.108.1	I will sing and give praise,
PSA.108.1	even with my glory.
PSA.108.2	Awake, psaltery and harp:
PSA.108.2	I 
PSA.108.3	I will praise thee, O 
PSA.108.3	and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
PSA.108.4	For thy mercy 
PSA.108.4	and thy truth 
PSA.108.5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:
PSA.108.5	and thy glory above all the earth;
PSA.108.6	that thy beloved may be delivered:
PSA.108.6	save 
PSA.108.7	God hath spoken in his holiness;
PSA.108.7	I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem,
PSA.108.7	and mete out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gil´e-ad 
PSA.108.8	E´phra-im also 
PSA.108.8	Judah 
PSA.108.9	Moab 
PSA.108.9	over Edom will I cast out my shoe;
PSA.108.9	over Philis´ti-a will I triumph.
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me into the strong city?
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me into Edom?
PSA.108.11	And wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
PSA.108.12	Give us help from trouble:
PSA.108.12	for vain 
PSA.108.13	Through God we shall do valiantly:
PSA.108.13	for he 
PSA.109.1	Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
PSA.109.2	for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me:
PSA.109.2	they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
PSA.109.3	They compassed me about also with words of hatred;
PSA.109.3	and fought against me without a cause.
PSA.109.4	For my love they are my adversaries:
PSA.109.4	but I 
PSA.109.5	And they have rewarded me evil for good,
PSA.109.5	and hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	Set thou a wicked man over him:
PSA.109.6	and let Satan
PSA.109.7	When he shall be judged, let him be condemned:
PSA.109.7	and let his prayer become sin.
PSA.109.9	Let his children be fatherless,
PSA.109.9	and his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg:
PSA.109.10	let them seek 
PSA.109.11	Let the extortioner catch all that he hath;
PSA.109.11	and let the strangers spoil his labor.
PSA.109.12	Let there be none to extend mercy unto him:
PSA.109.12	neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	Let his posterity be cut off;
PSA.109.14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the 
PSA.109.14	and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
PSA.109.15	Let them be before the 
PSA.109.15	that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
PSA.109.16	Because that he remembered not to show mercy,
PSA.109.16	but persecuted the poor and needy man,
PSA.109.16	that he might even slay the broken in heart.
PSA.109.17	As he loved cursing,
PSA.109.17	so let it come unto him:
PSA.109.17	as he delighted not in blessing,
PSA.109.17	so let it be far from him.
PSA.109.18	As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
PSA.109.18	so let it come into his bowels like water,
PSA.109.18	and like oil into his bones.
PSA.109.19	Let it be unto him as the garment 
PSA.109.19	and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
PSA.109.20	and of them that speak evil against my soul.
PSA.109.21	But do thou for me, O 
PSA.109.21	because thy mercy 
PSA.109.22	For I 
PSA.109.22	and my heart is wounded within me.
PSA.109.23	I am gone like the shadow when it declineth:
PSA.109.23	I am tossed up and down as the locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak through fasting;
PSA.109.24	and my flesh faileth of fatness.
PSA.109.26	Help me, O 
PSA.109.26	O save me according to thy mercy:
PSA.109.27	that they may know that this 
PSA.109.28	Let them curse, but bless thou:
PSA.109.28	when they arise, let them be ashamed;
PSA.109.28	but let thy servant rejoice.
PSA.109.29	Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame;
PSA.109.29	and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
PSA.109.30	I will greatly praise the 
PSA.109.30	yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
PSA.109.31	For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor,
PSA.109.31	to save

PSA.119.50	This 
PSA.119.50	for thy word hath quickened me.
PSA.119.51	The proud have had me greatly in derision:
PSA.119.52	I remembered thy judgments of old, O 
PSA.119.52	and have comforted myself.
PSA.119.53	Horror hath taken hold upon me
PSA.119.53	because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
PSA.119.54	Thy statutes have been my songs
PSA.119.54	in the house of my pilgrimage.
PSA.119.55	I have remembered thy name, O 
PSA.119.55	and have kept thy law.
PSA.119.56	This I had,
PSA.119.56	because I kept thy precepts.
PSA.119.57	I have said that I would keep thy words.
PSA.119.58	I entreated thy favor with 
PSA.119.58	be merciful unto me according to thy word.
PSA.119.59	I thought on my ways,
PSA.119.59	and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
PSA.119.60	I made haste, and delayed not
PSA.119.60	to keep thy commandments.
PSA.119.61	The bands of the wicked have robbed me:
PSA.119.62	At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee
PSA.119.62	because of thy righteous judgments.
PSA.119.63	I 
PSA.119.63	and of them that keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.64	The earth, O 
PSA.119.64	teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.65	Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O 
PSA.119.65	according unto thy word.
PSA.119.66	Teach me good judgment and knowledge:
PSA.119.66	for I have believed thy commandments.
PSA.119.67	Before I was afflicted I went astray:
PSA.119.67	but now have I kept thy word.
PSA.119.68	Thou 
PSA.119.68	teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.69	The proud have forged a lie against me:
PSA.119.70	Their heart is as fat as grease:
PSA.119.71	that I might learn thy statutes.
PSA.119.72	The law of thy mouth 
PSA.119.72	than thousands of gold and silver.
PSA.119.73	Thy hands have made me and fashioned me:
PSA.119.73	give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.
PSA.119.74	They that fear thee will be glad when they see me;
PSA.119.74	because I have hoped in thy word.
PSA.119.75	I know, O 
PSA.119.75	and 
PSA.119.76	Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
PSA.119.76	according to thy word unto thy servant.
PSA.119.77	Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live:
PSA.119.77	for thy law 
PSA.119.78	Let the proud be ashamed;
PSA.119.78	for they dealt perversely with me without a cause:
PSA.119.79	Let those that fear thee turn unto me,
PSA.119.79	and those that have known thy testimonies.
PSA.119.80	Let my heart be sound in thy statutes;
PSA.119.80	that I be not ashamed.
PSA.119.81	My soul fainteth for thy salvation:
PSA.119.82	Mine eyes fail for thy word,
PSA.119.82	saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
PSA.119.83	For I am become like a bottle in the smoke;
PSA.119.84	How many 
PSA.119.84	When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
PSA.119.85	The proud have digged pits for me,
PSA.119.85	which 
PSA.119.86	All thy commandments 
PSA.119.86	they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.
PSA.119.87	They had almost consumed me upon earth;
PSA.119.87	but I forsook not thy precepts.
PSA.119.88	Quicken me after thy loving-kindness;
PSA.119.88	so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.
PSA.119.89	For ever, O 
PSA.119.90	Thy faithfulness 
PSA.119.90	thou hast established the earth,
PSA.119.90	and it abideth.
PSA.119.91	They continue this day according to thine ordinances:
PSA.119.91	for all 
PSA.119.92	Unless thy law 
PSA.119.92	I should then have perished in mine affliction.
PSA.119.93	I will never forget thy precepts:
PSA.119.93	for with them thou hast quickened me.
PSA.119.94	I 
PSA.119.94	for I have sought thy precepts.
PSA.119.95	The wicked have waited for me to destroy me:
PSA.119.96	I have seen an end of all perfection:
PSA.119.97	O how love I thy law!
PSA.119.97	It 
PSA.119.98	Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies:
PSA.119.98	for they 
PSA.119.99	I have more understanding than all my teachers:
PSA.119.99	for thy testimonies 
PSA.119.100	I understand more than the ancients,
PSA.119.100	because I keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.101	I have refrained my feet from every evil way,
PSA.119.101	that I might keep thy word.
PSA.119.102	I have not departed from thy judgments:
PSA.119.102	for thou hast taught me.
PSA.119.103	How sweet are thy words unto my taste!
PSA.119.104	Through thy precepts I get understanding:
PSA.119.104	therefore I hate every false way.
PSA.119.105	Thy word 
PSA.119.105	and a light unto my path.
PSA.119.106	I have sworn, and I will perform 
PSA.119.106	that I will keep thy righteous judgments.
PSA.119.107	I am afflicted very much:
PSA.119.107	quicken me, O 
PSA.119.108	Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O 
PSA.119.108	and teach me thy judgments.
PSA.119.109	My soul 
PSA.119.109	yet do I not forget thy law.
PSA.119.110	The wicked have laid a snare for me:
PSA.119.110	yet I erred not from thy precepts.
PSA.119.111	Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever:
PSA.119.111	for they 
PSA.119.112	I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes
PSA.119.112	always, 
PSA.119.113	I hate 
PSA.119.113	but thy law do I love.
PSA.119.114	Thou 
PSA.119.114	I hope in thy word.
PSA.119.115	Depart from me, ye evildoers:
PSA.119.115	for I will keep the commandments of my God.
PSA.119.116	Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live:
PSA.119.116	and let me not be ashamed of my hope.
PSA.119.117	Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe:
PSA.119.117	and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.
PSA.119.118	Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
PSA.119.118	for their deceit 
PSA.119.119	Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth 
PSA.119.119	therefore I love thy testimonies.
PSA.119.120	My flesh trembleth for fear of thee;
PSA.119.120	and I am afraid of thy judgments.
PSA.119.121	I have done judgment and justice:
PSA.119.121	leave me not to mine oppressors.
PSA.119.122	Be surety for thy servant for good:
PSA.119.122	let not the proud oppress me.
PSA.119.123	Mine eyes fail for thy salvation,
PSA.119.123	and for the word of thy righteousness.
PSA.119.124	Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy,
PSA.119.124	and teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.125	I 
PSA.119.125	that I may know thy testimonies.
PSA.119.127	Therefore I love thy commandments above gold;
PSA.119.127	yea, above fine gold.
PSA.119.128	Therefore I esteem all 
PSA.119.129	Thy testimonies 
PSA.119.129	therefore doth my soul keep them.
PSA.119.130	The entrance of thy words giveth light;
PSA.119.130	it giveth understanding unto the simple.
PSA.119.131	I opened my mouth, and panted:
PSA.119.131	for I longed for thy commandments.
PSA.119.132	Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me,
PSA.119.132	as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.
PSA.119.133	Order my steps in thy word:
PSA.119.133	and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
PSA.119.134	Deliver me from the oppression of man:
PSA.119.134	so will I keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.135	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant;
PSA.119.135	and teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.136	Rivers of waters run down mine eyes,
PSA.119.136	because they keep not thy law.
PSA.119.137	Righteous 
PSA.119.137	and upright 
PSA.119.138	Thy testimonies 
PSA.119.139	My zeal hath consumed me,
PSA.119.139	because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.
PSA.119.140	Thy word 
PSA.119.140	therefore thy servant loveth it.
PSA.119.141	I 
PSA.119.142	Thy righteousness 
PSA.119.142	and thy law 
PSA.119.143	Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me:
PSA.119.144	The righteousness of thy testimonies 
PSA.119.144	give me understanding, and I shall live.
PSA.119.145	I cried with 
PSA.119.145	hear me, O 
PSA.119.145	I will keep thy statutes.
PSA.119.146	I cried unto thee;
PSA.119.146	save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
PSA.119.147	I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried:
PSA.119.147	I hoped in thy word.
PSA.119.148	Mine eyes prevent the 
PSA.119.148	that I might meditate in thy word.
PSA.119.149	Hear my voice according unto thy loving-kindness:
PSA.119.149	O 
PSA.119.150	They draw nigh that follow after mischief:
PSA.119.150	they are far from thy law.
PSA.119.151	Thou 
PSA.119.151	and all thy commandments 
PSA.119.152	Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old
PSA.119.152	that thou hast founded them for ever.
PSA.119.153	Consider mine affliction, and deliver me:
PSA.119.153	for I do not forget thy law.
PSA.119.154	Plead my cause, and deliver me:
PSA.119.154	quicken me according to thy word.
PSA.119.155	Salvation 
PSA.119.155	for they seek not thy statutes.
PSA.119.156	Great 
PSA.119.156	quicken me according to thy judgments.
PSA.119.157	Many 
PSA.119.158	I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved;
PSA.119.158	because they kept not thy word.
PSA.119.159	Consider how I love thy precepts:
PSA.119.159	quicken me, O 
PSA.119.160	Thy word 
PSA.119.160	and every one of thy righteous judgments 
PSA.119.161	Princes have persecuted me without a cause:
PSA.119.161	but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.
PSA.119.162	I rejoice at thy word,
PSA.119.162	as one that findeth great spoil.
PSA.119.163	I hate and abhor lying:
PSA.119.164	Seven times a day do I praise thee,
PSA.119.164	because of thy righteous judgments.
PSA.119.165	Great peace have they which love thy law:
PSA.119.165	and nothing shall offend them.
PSA.119.166	and done thy commandments.
PSA.119.167	My soul hath kept thy testimonies;
PSA.119.167	and I love them exceedingly.
PSA.119.168	I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies:
PSA.119.168	for all my ways 
PSA.119.169	Let my cry come near before thee, O 
PSA.119.169	give me understanding according to thy word.
PSA.119.170	Let my supplication come before thee:
PSA.119.170	deliver me according to thy word.
PSA.119.171	My lips shall utter praise,
PSA.119.171	when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
PSA.119.172	My tongue shall speak of thy word:
PSA.119.172	for all thy commandments 
PSA.119.173	Let thine hand help me;
PSA.119.173	for I have chosen thy precepts.
PSA.119.174	I have longed for thy salvation, O 
PSA.119.174	and thy law 
PSA.119.175	Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee;
PSA.119.175	and let thy judgments help me.
PSA.119.176	I have gone astray like a lost sheep:
PSA.119.176	seek thy servant;
PSA.119.176	for I do not forget thy commandments.
PSA.120.1	In my distress I cried unto the 
PSA.120.1	and he heard me.
PSA.120.2	Deliver my soul, O 
PSA.120.3	What shall be given unto thee?
PSA.120.3	Or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
PSA.120.4	Sharp arrows of the mighty,
PSA.120.4	with coals of juniper.
PSA.120.5	Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech,
PSA.120.6	My soul hath long dwelt
PSA.120.6	with him that hateth peace.
PSA.120.7	I 
PSA.120.7	but when I speak, they 
PSA.121.1	I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills,
PSA.121.1	from whence cometh my help.
PSA.121.2	My help 
PSA.121.2	which made heaven and earth.
PSA.121.3	He will not suffer thy foot to be moved:
PSA.121.3	he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
PSA.121.4	Behold, he that keepeth Israel
PSA.121.4	shall neither slumber nor sleep.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.5	the 
PSA.121.6	The sun shall not smite thee by day,
PSA.121.6	nor the moon by night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.7	he shall preserve thy soul.
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.121.8	from this time forth, and even for evermore.
PSA.122.1	I was glad when they said unto me,
PSA.122.1	Let us go into the house of the 
PSA.122.2	Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
PSA.122.4	whither the tribes go up,
PSA.122.4	the tribes of the 
PSA.122.4	unto the testimony of Israel,
PSA.122.4	to give thanks unto the name of the 
PSA.122.5	For there are set thrones of judgment,
PSA.122.5	the thrones of the house of David.
PSA.122.6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
PSA.122.6	they shall prosper that love thee.
PSA.122.7	Peace be within thy walls,
PSA.122.8	For my brethren and companions' sakes,
PSA.122.8	I will now say, Peace 
PSA.122.9	Because of the house of the 
PSA.122.9	I will seek thy good.
PSA.123.1	Unto thee lift I up mine eyes,
PSA.123.1	O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
PSA.123.2	Behold, as the eyes of servants 
PSA.123.2	so our eyes 
PSA.123.2	until that he have mercy upon us.
PSA.123.3	Have mercy upon us, O 
PSA.123.3	have mercy upon us:
PSA.123.3	for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
PSA.123.4	Our soul is exceedingly filled
PSA.123.4	with the scorning of those that are at ease,
PSA.124.1	If 
PSA.124.1	now may Israel say;
PSA.124.2	If 
PSA.124.2	when men rose up against us:
PSA.124.3	then they had swallowed us up quick,
PSA.124.3	when their wrath was kindled against us:
PSA.124.4	then the waters had overwhelmed us,
PSA.124.4	the stream had gone over our soul:
PSA.124.5	then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
PSA.124.6	Blessed 
PSA.124.6	who hath not given us 
PSA.124.7	Our soul is escaped as a bird
PSA.124.7	out of the snare of the fowlers:
PSA.124.7	the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
PSA.124.8	Our help 
PSA.124.8	who made heaven and earth.
PSA.125.1	They that trust in the 
PSA.125.2	so the 
PSA.125.2	from henceforth even for ever.
PSA.125.3	For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous;
PSA.125.3	lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
PSA.125.4	Do good, O 
PSA.125.4	and to 
PSA.125.5	As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways,
PSA.125.5	the 
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.1	we were like them that dream.
PSA.126.2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
PSA.126.2	and our tongue with singing:
PSA.126.2	then said they among the heathen,
PSA.126.2	The 
PSA.126.3	The 
PSA.126.4	Turn again our captivity, O 
PSA.126.4	as the streams in the south.
PSA.126.5	They that sow in tears
PSA.126.5	shall reap in joy.
PSA.126.6	He that goeth forth and weepeth,
PSA.126.6	bearing precious seed,
PSA.126.6	shall doubtless come again with rejoicing,
PSA.126.6	bringing his sheaves 
PSA.127.1	Except the 
PSA.127.1	they labor in vain that build it:
PSA.127.1	except the 
PSA.127.1	the watchman waketh 
PSA.127.2	to sit up late,
PSA.127.2	to eat the bread of sorrows:
PSA.127.3	Lo, children 
PSA.127.4	As arrows 
PSA.127.4	so 
PSA.127.5	Happy 
PSA.127.5	they shall not be ashamed,
PSA.127.5	but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
PSA.128.1	Blessed 
PSA.128.1	that walketh in his ways.
PSA.128.2	For thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands:
PSA.128.2	happy 
PSA.128.2	and 
PSA.128.3	Thy wife 
PSA.128.3	by the sides of thine house:
PSA.128.3	thy children like olive plants
PSA.128.3	round about thy table.
PSA.128.4	Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the 
PSA.128.5	The 
PSA.128.5	and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem
PSA.128.5	all the days of thy life.
PSA.128.6	Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children,
PSA.129.1	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth,
PSA.129.1	may Israel now say:
PSA.129.2	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth:
PSA.129.2	yet they have not prevailed against me.
PSA.129.3	The plowers plowed upon my back:
PSA.129.3	they made long their furrows.
PSA.129.4	The 
PSA.129.4	he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
PSA.129.5	Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
PSA.129.6	Let them be as the grass 
PSA.129.6	which withereth afore it groweth up:
PSA.129.7	wherewith the mower filleth not his hand;
PSA.129.7	nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
PSA.129.8	Neither do they which go by say,
PSA.129.8	The blessing of the 
PSA.129.8	we bless you in the name of the 
PSA.130.1	Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O 
PSA.130.2	Lord, hear my voice:
PSA.130.2	let thine ears be attentive
PSA.130.2	to the voice of my supplications.
PSA.130.3	If thou, 
PSA.130.3	O Lord, who shall stand?
PSA.130.4	But 
PSA.130.4	that thou mayest be feared.
PSA.130.5	I wait for the 
PSA.130.5	my soul doth wait,
PSA.130.5	and in his word do I hope.
PSA.130.6	My soul 
PSA.130.6	more than they that watch for the morning:

PSA.130.7	for with the 
PSA.130.7	and with him 
PSA.130.8	from all his iniquities.
PSA.131.1	nor mine eyes lofty:
PSA.131.1	neither do I exercise myself in great matters,
PSA.131.1	or in things too high for me.
PSA.131.2	Surely I have behaved and quieted myself,
PSA.131.2	as a child that is weaned of his mother:

PSA.132.5	a habitation for the mighty 
PSA.132.6	Lo, we heard of it at Eph´ratah:
PSA.132.6	we found it in the fields of the wood.

PSA.132.8	thou, and the ark of thy strength.
PSA.132.9	Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness;
PSA.132.9	and let thy saints shout for joy.
PSA.132.10	For thy servant David's sake
PSA.132.10	turn not away the face of thine anointed.
PSA.132.11	he will not turn from it;
PSA.132.11	Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
PSA.132.12	If thy children will keep my covenant
PSA.132.12	and my testimony that I shall teach them,
PSA.132.12	their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.
PSA.132.13	For the

PSA.138.7	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me:
PSA.138.7	thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies,
PSA.138.7	and thy right hand shall save me.
PSA.138.8	The 
PSA.138.8	thy mercy, O 
PSA.138.8	forsake not the works of thine own hands.
PSA.139.1	O 
PSA.139.2	Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising;
PSA.139.2	thou understandest my thought afar off.
PSA.139.3	Thou compassest my path and my lying down,
PSA.139.3	and art acquainted 
PSA.139.4	For 
PSA.139.5	Thou hast beset me behind and before,
PSA.139.5	and laid thine hand upon me.
PSA.139.6	it is high, I cannot 
PSA.139.7	Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?
PSA.139.7	Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
PSA.139.8	If I ascend up into heaven, thou 
PSA.139.8	if I make my bed in hell,
PSA.139.10	even there shall thy hand lead me,
PSA.139.10	and thy right hand shall hold me.
PSA.139.11	If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me;
PSA.139.11	even the night shall be light about me.
PSA.139.12	Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee;
PSA.139.12	but the night shineth as the day:
PSA.139.12	the darkness and the light 
PSA.139.13	For thou hast possessed my reins:
PSA.139.13	thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
PSA.139.14	I will praise thee; for I am fearfully 
PSA.139.14	marvelous 
PSA.139.14	and 
PSA.139.15	My substance was not hid from thee
PSA.139.15	when I was made in secret,
PSA.139.16	Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect;
PSA.139.16	and in thy book all 
PSA.139.16	when 
PSA.139.17	How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God!
PSA.139.17	How great is the sum of them!
PSA.139.18	when I awake, I am still with thee.
PSA.139.19	Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God:
PSA.139.19	depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
PSA.139.20	For they speak against thee wickedly,
PSA.139.21	Do not I hate them, O 
PSA.139.21	And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
PSA.139.22	I hate them with perfect hatred:
PSA.139.22	I count them mine enemies.
PSA.139.23	Search me, O God, and know my heart:
PSA.139.23	try me, and know my thoughts:
PSA.139.24	and see if 
PSA.139.24	and lead me in the way everlasting.
PSA.140.1	Deliver me, O 
PSA.140.1	preserve me from the violent man;
PSA.140.2	which imagine mischiefs in 
PSA.140.2	continually are they gathered together 
PSA.140.3	adders' poison 
PSA.140.4	Keep me, O 
PSA.140.4	preserve me from the violent man;
PSA.140.4	who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
PSA.140.5	The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords;
PSA.140.5	they have spread a net by the wayside;
PSA.140.5	they have set gins for me. 
PSA.140.6	I said unto the 
PSA.140.6	hear the voice of my supplications, O 
PSA.140.7	O 
PSA.140.7	thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
PSA.140.8	Grant not, O 
PSA.140.8	further not his wicked device;
PSA.140.9	let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
PSA.140.10	Let burning coals fall upon them:
PSA.140.10	let them be cast into the fire;
PSA.140.10	into deep pits,
PSA.140.10	that they rise not up again.
PSA.140.11	Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth:
PSA.140.11	evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow 
PSA.140.12	I know that the 
PSA.140.13	Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name:
PSA.140.13	the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
PSA.141.1	make haste unto me;
PSA.141.1	give ear unto my voice,
PSA.141.1	when I cry unto thee.
PSA.141.3	Set a watch, O 
PSA.141.3	keep the door of my lips.
PSA.141.4	Incline not my heart to 
PSA.141.4	to practise wicked works
PSA.141.4	with men that work iniquity:
PSA.141.4	and let me not eat of their dainties.
PSA.141.5	Let the righteous smite me;
PSA.141.5	and let him reprove me;
PSA.141.5	for yet my prayer also 
PSA.141.6	When their judges are overthrown in stony places,
PSA.141.6	they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
PSA.141.7	Our bones are scattered at the grave's
PSA.141.7	as when one cutteth and cleaveth 
PSA.141.8	But mine eyes 
PSA.141.8	in thee is my trust;
PSA.141.8	leave not my soul destitute.
PSA.141.9	Keep me from the snares 
PSA.141.9	and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
PSA.141.10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
PSA.141.10	whilst that I withal escape.
PSA.142.1	I cried unto the 
PSA.142.1	with my voice unto the 
PSA.142.2	I poured out my complaint before him;
PSA.142.2	I showed before him my trouble.
PSA.142.3	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,
PSA.142.3	then thou knewest my path.
PSA.142.3	In the way wherein I walked
PSA.142.3	have they privily laid a snare for me.
PSA.142.4	I looked on 
PSA.142.4	but 
PSA.142.4	refuge failed me;
PSA.142.4	no man cared for my soul.
PSA.142.5	I cried unto thee, O 
PSA.142.5	I said, Thou 
PSA.142.6	Attend unto my cry;
PSA.142.6	for I am brought very low:
PSA.142.6	deliver me from my persecutors;
PSA.142.6	for they are stronger than I.
PSA.142.7	Bring my soul out of prison,
PSA.142.7	that I may praise thy name:
PSA.142.7	the righteous shall compass me about;
PSA.142.7	for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
PSA.143.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.143.1	give ear to my supplications:
PSA.143.1	in thy faithfulness answer me,
PSA.143.2	for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
PSA.143.3	For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;
PSA.143.3	he hath smitten my life down to the ground;
PSA.143.3	he hath made me to dwell in darkness,
PSA.143.3	as those that have been long dead.
PSA.143.4	Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me;
PSA.143.4	my heart within me is desolate.
PSA.143.5	I remember the days of old;
PSA.143.5	I meditate on all thy works;
PSA.143.5	I muse on the work of thy hands.
PSA.143.6	I stretch forth my hands unto thee:
PSA.143.6	my soul 
PSA.143.7	Hear me speedily, O 
PSA.143.7	my spirit faileth:
PSA.143.7	hide not thy face from me,
PSA.143.7	lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
PSA.143.8	Cause me to hear thy loving-kindness in the morning;
PSA.143.8	for in thee do I trust:
PSA.143.8	cause me to know the way wherein I should walk;
PSA.143.8	for I lift up my soul unto thee.
PSA.143.9	Deliver me, O 
PSA.143.9	I flee unto thee to hide me.
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do thy will;
PSA.143.10	for thou 
PSA.143.10	thy Spirit 
PSA.143.10	lead me into the land of uprightness.
PSA.143.11	Quicken me, O 
PSA.143.11	for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
PSA.143.12	And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies,
PSA.143.12	and destroy all them that afflict my soul:
PSA.143.12	for I 
PSA.144.1	Blessed 
PSA.144.1	which teacheth my hands to war,
PSA.144.2	my goodness, and my fortress;
PSA.144.2	my high tower, and my deliverer;
PSA.144.2	my shield, and 
PSA.144.2	who subdueth my people under me.
PSA.144.4	Man is like to vanity:
PSA.144.4	his days 
PSA.144.5	Bow thy heavens, O 
PSA.144.5	touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
PSA.144.6	Cast forth lightning, and scatter them:
PSA.144.6	shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.
PSA.144.7	Send thine hand from above;
PSA.144.7	rid me, and deliver me out of great waters,
PSA.144.7	from the hand of strange children;
PSA.144.8	whose mouth speaketh vanity,
PSA.144.8	and their right hand

PSA.144.9	will I sing praises unto thee.

PRO.1.5	A wise 
PRO.1.5	and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
PRO.1.6	to understand a proverb, and the interpretation;
PRO.1.6	the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
PRO.1.8	My son, hear the instruction of thy father,
PRO.1.8	and forsake not the law of thy mother:
PRO.1.9	for they 
PRO.1.9	and chains about thy neck.
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinners entice thee,
PRO.1.10	consent thou not.
PRO.1.11	If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood,
PRO.1.11	let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
PRO.1.12	let us swallow them up alive as the grave;
PRO.1.12	and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
PRO.1.13	we shall find all precious substance,
PRO.1.13	we shall fill our houses with spoil:
PRO.1.14	cast in thy lot among us;
PRO.1.14	let us all have one purse:
PRO.1.15	my son, walk not thou in the way with them;
PRO.1.15	refrain thy foot from their path:
PRO.1.16	for their feet run to evil,
PRO.1.16	and make haste to shed blood.
PRO.1.17	Surely in vain the net is spread
PRO.1.17	in the sight of any bird.
PRO.1.18	And they lay wait for their

PRO.1.20	she uttereth her voice in the streets:
PRO.1.21	she crieth in the chief place of concourse,
PRO.1.21	in the openings of the gates:
PRO.1.21	in the city she uttereth her words, 
PRO.1.22	How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?
PRO.1.22	and the scorners delight in their scorning,
PRO.1.22	and fools hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	Turn you at my reproof:
PRO.1.23	behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you,
PRO.1.23	I will make known my words unto you.
PRO.1.24	Because I have called, and ye refused;
PRO.1.24	I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
PRO.1.25	but ye have set at nought all my counsel,
PRO.1.25	and would none of my reproof:
PRO.1.26	I also will laugh at your calamity;
PRO.1.26	I will mock when your fear cometh;
PRO.1.27	when your fear cometh as desolation,
PRO.1.27	and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind;
PRO.1.27	when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
PRO.1.28	Then shall they call upon me,
PRO.1.28	but I will not answer;
PRO.1.28	they shall seek me early,
PRO.1.28	but they shall not find me:
PRO.1.29	for that they hated knowledge,

PRO.1.30	they despised all my reproof.
PRO.1.31	Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,

PRO.1.32	For the turning away of the simple shall slay them,
PRO.1.32	and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
PRO.1.33	But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely,
PRO.1.33	and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
PRO.2.1	My son, if thou wilt receive my words,
PRO.2.1	and hide my commandments with thee;
PRO.2.2	so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom,
PRO.2.3	yea, if thou criest after knowledge,
PRO.2.4	if thou seekest her as silver,
PRO.2.4	and searchest for her as 
PRO.2.5	then shalt thou understand the fear of the

PRO.2.7	He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous:
PRO.2.8	He keepeth the paths of judgment,
PRO.2.8	and preserveth the way of his saints.
PRO.2.9	Then shalt thou understand righteousness,
PRO.2.9	and judgment, and equity;

PRO.2.18	For her house inclineth unto death,
PRO.2.18	and her paths unto the dead.
PRO.2.19	None that go unto her return again,
PRO.2.19	neither take they hold of the paths of life.
PRO.2.20	That thou mayest walk in the way of good 
PRO.2.20	and keep the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For the upright shall dwell in the land,
PRO.2.21	and the perfect shall remain in it.
PRO.2.22	But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth,
PRO.2.22	and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
PRO.3.1	My son, forget not my law;
PRO.3.1	but let thine heart keep my commandments:
PRO.3.2	for length of days, and long life,
PRO.3.2	and peace, shall they add to thee.
PRO.3.3	Let not mercy and truth forsake thee:

PRO.3.4	in the sight of God and man.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the 
PRO.3.5	and lean not unto thine own understanding.
PRO.3.6	In all thy ways acknowledge him,
PRO.3.6	and he shall direct thy paths.
PRO.3.7	fear the 
PRO.3.8	It shall be health to thy navel,
PRO.3.8	and marrow to thy bones.
PRO.3.9	Honor the 
PRO.3.9	and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
PRO.3.10	so shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
PRO.3.10	and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
PRO.3.11	neither be weary of his correction:
PRO.3.12	even as a father the son 
PRO.3.13	Happy 
PRO.3.13	and the man 
PRO.3.14	for the merchandise of it 
PRO.3.14	and the gain thereof than fine gold.
PRO.3.15	She 
PRO.3.15	and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
PRO.3.16	Length of days 
PRO.3.17	Her ways 
PRO.3.17	and all her paths 
PRO.3.18	She 
PRO.3.18	and happy 
PRO.3.19	The 
PRO.3.19	by understanding hath he established the heavens.
PRO.3.20	By his knowledge the depths are broken up,
PRO.3.20	and the clouds drop down the dew.
PRO.3.21	My son, let not them depart from thine eyes:
PRO.3.21	keep sound wisdom and discretion:
PRO.3.22	so shall they be life unto thy soul,
PRO.3.22	and grace to thy neck.
PRO.3.23	Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely,
PRO.3.23	and thy foot shall not stumble.
PRO.3.24	When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid:
PRO.3.24	yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
PRO.3.25	Be not afraid of sudden fear,
PRO.3.25	neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
PRO.3.26	For the 
PRO.3.26	and shall keep thy foot from being taken.
PRO.3.27	Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,
PRO.3.27	when it is in the power of thine hand to do 
PRO.3.28	Say not unto thy neighbor,
PRO.3.28	Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give;
PRO.3.28	when thou hast it by thee.
PRO.3.29	Devise not evil against thy neighbor,
PRO.3.29	seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
PRO.3.30	Strive not with a man without cause,
PRO.3.30	if he have done thee no harm.
PRO.3.31	Envy thou not the oppressor,
PRO.3.31	and choose none of his ways.
PRO.3.32	For the froward 
PRO.3.32	but his secret 
PRO.3.33	The curse of the 
PRO.3.33	but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
PRO.3.34	but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
PRO.3.35	The wise shall inherit glory:
PRO.3.35	but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
PRO.4.1	Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father,
PRO.4.1	and attend to know understanding.
PRO.4.2	For I give you good doctrine,
PRO.4.2	forsake ye not my law.
PRO.4.3	For I was my father's son,
PRO.4.3	tender and only 
PRO.4.4	He taught me also, and said unto me,
PRO.4.4	Let thine heart retain my words:
PRO.4.4	keep my commandments, and live.
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom, get understanding:
PRO.4.5	forget 
PRO.4.6	Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee:
PRO.4.6	love her, and she shall keep thee.
PRO.4.7	Wisdom 
PRO.4.7	and with all thy getting get understanding.
PRO.4.8	Exalt her, and she shall promote thee:
PRO.4.8	she shall bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.
PRO.4.9	She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace:
PRO.4.9	a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
PRO.4.10	Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;
PRO.4.10	and the years of thy life shall be many.
PRO.4.11	I have taught thee in the way of wisdom;
PRO.4.11	I have led thee in right paths.
PRO.4.12	When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened;
PRO.4.12	and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
PRO.4.13	Take fast hold of instruction;
PRO.4.13	let 
PRO.4.13	keep her; for she 
PRO.4.14	Enter not into the path of the wicked,
PRO.4.14	and go not in the way of evil 
PRO.4.15	Avoid it, pass not by it,
PRO.4.15	turn from it, and pass away.
PRO.4.16	For they sleep not, except they have done mischief;
PRO.4.16	and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause 
PRO.4.17	For they eat the bread of wickedness,
PRO.4.17	and drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	But the path of the just 
PRO.4.18	that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked 
PRO.4.19	they know not at what they stumble.
PRO.4.20	My son, attend to my words;
PRO.4.20	incline thine ear unto my sayings.
PRO.4.21	Let them not depart from thine eyes;
PRO.4.21	keep them in the midst of thine heart.
PRO.4.22	For they 
PRO.4.22	and health to all their flesh.
PRO.4.23	Keep thy heart with all diligence;
PRO.4.23	for out of it 
PRO.4.24	Put away from thee a froward mouth,
PRO.4.24	and perverse lips put far from thee.
PRO.4.25	Let thine eyes look right on,
PRO.4.25	and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
PRO.4.26	and let all thy ways be established.
PRO.4.27	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left:
PRO.4.27	remove thy foot from evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, attend unto my wisdom,
PRO.5.2	that thou mayest regard discretion,
PRO.5.2	and 
PRO.5.3	For the lips of a strange woman drop 
PRO.5.3	and her mouth 
PRO.5.4	but her end is bitter as wormwood,
PRO.5.4	sharp as a two-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death;
PRO.5.5	her steps take hold on hell.
PRO.5.6	Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life,
PRO.5.6	her ways are movable, 
PRO.5.7	Hear me now therefore, O ye children,
PRO.5.7	and depart not from the words of my mouth.
PRO.5.8	Remove thy way far from her,
PRO.5.8	and come not nigh the door of her house:
PRO.5.9	lest thou give thine honor unto others,
PRO.5.9	and thy years unto the cruel:
PRO.5.10	lest strangers be filled with thy wealth;
PRO.5.10	and thy labors 
PRO.5.11	and thou mourn at the last,
PRO.5.11	when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
PRO.5.12	and say, How have I hated instruction,
PRO.5.12	and my heart despised reproof;
PRO.5.13	and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,
PRO.5.13	nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
PRO.5.14	I was almost in all evil
PRO.5.14	in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
PRO.5.15	Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
PRO.5.15	and running waters out of thine own well.
PRO.5.16	Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad,
PRO.5.17	Let them be only thine own,
PRO.5.17	and not strangers' with thee.
PRO.5.18	Let thy fountain be blessed:
PRO.5.18	and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
PRO.5.19	let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;
PRO.5.19	and be thou ravished always with her love.
PRO.5.20	And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
PRO.5.20	and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
PRO.5.21	For the ways of man 
PRO.5.21	and he pondereth all his goings.
PRO.5.22	His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself,
PRO.5.22	and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
PRO.5.23	He shall die without instruction;
PRO.5.23	and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
PRO.6.1	My son, if thou be surety for thy friend,
PRO.6.2	thou art snared with the words of thy mouth,
PRO.6.2	thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
PRO.6.3	Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself,
PRO.6.3	when thou art come into the hand of thy friend;
PRO.6.3	go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
PRO.6.4	Give not sleep to thine eyes,
PRO.6.4	nor slumber to thine eyelids.
PRO.6.5	Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand 
PRO.6.5	and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
PRO.6.6	consider her ways, and be wise:
PRO.6.7	which having no guide,
PRO.6.7	overseer, or ruler,
PRO.6.8	provideth her meat in the summer,
PRO.6.9	How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?
PRO.6.9	When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
PRO.6.10	a little folding of the hands to sleep:
PRO.6.11	so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth,
PRO.6.11	and thy want as an armed man.
PRO.6.12	A naughty person, a wicked man,
PRO.6.12	walketh with a froward mouth.
PRO.6.13	He winketh with his eyes,
PRO.6.13	he speaketh with his feet,
PRO.6.13	he teacheth with his fingers;
PRO.6.14	frowardness 
PRO.6.14	he deviseth mischief continually;
PRO.6.14	he soweth discord.
PRO.6.15	Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly;
PRO.6.15	suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
PRO.6.16	These six 
PRO.6.16	yea, seven 
PRO.6.17	a proud look, a lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	and hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations,
PRO.6.18	feet that be swift in running to mischief,
PRO.6.19	a false witness 
PRO.6.19	and he that soweth discord among brethren.
PRO.6.20	My son, keep thy father's commandment,
PRO.6.20	and forsake not the law of thy mother:
PRO.6.21	bind them continually upon thine heart,
PRO.6.22	When thou goest, it shall lead thee;
PRO.6.22	when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee;
PRO.6.22	and 
PRO.6.23	For the commandment 
PRO.6.23	and reproofs of instruction 
PRO.6.24	to keep thee from the evil woman,
PRO.6.24	from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
PRO.6.25	Lust not after her beauty in thine heart;
PRO.6.25	neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
PRO.6.26	For by means of a whorish woman 
PRO.6.26	and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
PRO.6.27	Can a man take fire in his bosom,
PRO.6.27	and his clothes not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Can one go upon hot coals,
PRO.6.28	and his feet not be burned?
PRO.6.29	So he that goeth in to his neighbor's wife;
PRO.6.29	whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
PRO.6.30	if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
PRO.6.31	but 
PRO.6.31	he shall give all the substance of his house.
PRO.6.32	he 
PRO.6.33	A wound and dishonor shall he get;
PRO.6.33	and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
PRO.6.34	For jealousy 
PRO.6.34	therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
PRO.6.35	He will not regard any ransom;
PRO.6.35	neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words,
PRO.7.1	and lay up my commandments with thee.
PRO.7.2	Keep my commandments, and live;
PRO.7.2	and my law as the apple of thine eye.
PRO.7.3	Bind them upon thy fingers,
PRO.7.3	write them upon the table of thine heart.
PRO.7.4	Say unto wisdom, Thou 
PRO.7.4	and call understanding 
PRO.7.5	that they may keep thee from the strange woman,
PRO.7.5	from the stranger 
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house
PRO.7.6	I looked through my casement,
PRO.7.7	and beheld among the simple ones,
PRO.7.7	I discerned among the youths,
PRO.7.7	a young man void of understanding,
PRO.7.8	passing through the street near her corner;
PRO.7.8	and he went the way to her house,
PRO.7.9	in the twilight, in the evening,
PRO.7.9	in the black and dark night.
PRO.7.10	And, behold, there met him a woman
PRO.7.11	(She 
PRO.7.11	her feet abide not in her house:
PRO.7.12	now 
PRO.7.12	and lieth in wait at every corner.)
PRO.7.13	So she caught him, and kissed him,
PRO.7.14	this day have I paid my vows.
PRO.7.15	Therefore came I forth to meet thee,
PRO.7.15	diligently to seek thy face,
PRO.7.15	and I have found thee.
PRO.7.16	I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry,
PRO.7.16	with carved 
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed
PRO.7.17	with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning:
PRO.7.18	let us solace ourselves with loves.
PRO.7.19	For the goodman 
PRO.7.19	he is gone a long journey:
PRO.7.20	he hath taken a bag of money with him,
PRO.7.21	With her much fair speech she caused him to yield,
PRO.7.21	with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
PRO.7.22	He goeth after her straightway,
PRO.7.22	as an ox goeth to the slaughter,
PRO.7.22	or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
PRO.7.23	till a dart strike through his liver;
PRO.7.23	as a bird hasteth to the snare,
PRO.7.23	and knoweth not that it 
PRO.7.24	Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children,
PRO.7.24	and attend to the words of my mouth.
PRO.7.25	Let not thine heart decline to her ways,
PRO.7.25	go not astray in her paths.
PRO.7.26	For she hath cast down many wounded:
PRO.7.26	yea, many strong 
PRO.7.27	Her house 
PRO.7.27	going down to the chambers of death.
PRO.8.1	and understanding put forth her voice?
PRO.8.2	She standeth in the top of high places,
PRO.8.2	by the way in the places of the paths.
PRO.8.3	She crieth at the gates,
PRO.8.3	at the entry of the city,
PRO.8.3	at the coming in at the doors:
PRO.8.4	Unto you, O men, I call;
PRO.8.4	and my voice 
PRO.8.5	O ye simple, understand wisdom:
PRO.8.5	and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
PRO.8.6	Hear; for I will speak of excellent things;
PRO.8.6	and the opening of my lips 
PRO.8.7	For my mouth shall speak truth;
PRO.8.7	and wickedness 
PRO.8.8	All the words of my mouth 
PRO.8.9	They 
PRO.8.9	and right to them that find knowledge.
PRO.8.10	Receive my instruction, and not silver;
PRO.8.10	and knowledge rather than choice gold.
PRO.8.11	For wisdom 
PRO.8.11	and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
PRO.8.12	I wisdom dwell with prudence,
PRO.8.12	and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
PRO.8.13	The fear of the 
PRO.8.13	pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way,
PRO.8.13	and the froward mouth, do I hate.
PRO.8.14	Counsel 
PRO.8.14	I 
PRO.8.15	By me kings reign,
PRO.8.15	and princes decree justice.
PRO.8.16	By me princes rule, and nobles,
PRO.8.17	I love them that love me;
PRO.8.17	and those that seek me early shall find me.
PRO.8.18	Riches and honor 
PRO.8.19	My fruit 
PRO.8.19	and my revenue than choice silver.
PRO.8.20	I lead in the way of righteousness,
PRO.8.20	in the midst of the paths of judgment:
PRO.8.21	that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance;
PRO.8.21	and I will fill their treasures.
PRO.8.22	before his works of old.
PRO.8.23	I was set up from everlasting,
PRO.8.23	from the beginning,
PRO.8.23	or ever the earth was.
PRO.8.24	When 
PRO.8.24	when 
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains were settled,
PRO.8.25	before the hills was I brought forth:
PRO.8.26	while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
PRO.8.26	nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
PRO.8.27	When he prepared the heavens, I 
PRO.8.27	when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
PRO.8.28	when he established the clouds above:
PRO.8.28	when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
PRO.8.29	when he gave to the sea his decree,
PRO.8.29	that the waters should not pass his commandment:
PRO.8.29	when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
PRO.8.30	then I was by him,
PRO.8.30	and I was daily 
PRO.8.30	rejoicing always before him;
PRO.8.31	rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth;
PRO.8.31	and my delights 
PRO.8.32	Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children:
PRO.8.32	for blessed 
PRO.8.33	Hear instruction, and be wise,
PRO.8.33	and refuse it not.
PRO.8.34	Blessed 
PRO.8.34	watching daily at my gates,
PRO.8.34	waiting at the posts of my doors.
PRO.8.35	For whoso findeth me findeth life,
PRO.8.35	and shall obtain favor of the 
PRO.8.36	But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul:
PRO.8.36	all they that hate me love death.
PRO.9.1	Wisdom hath builded her house,
PRO.9.1	she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
PRO.9.2	she hath killed her beasts;
PRO.9.2	she hath mingled her wine;
PRO.9.2	she hath also furnished her table.
PRO.9.3	She hath sent forth her maidens:
PRO.9.3	she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
PRO.9.4	Whoso 
PRO.9.5	Come, eat of my bread,
PRO.9.5	and drink of the wine 
PRO.9.6	Forsake the foolish, and live;
PRO.9.6	and go in the way of understanding.
PRO.9.7	He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame:
PRO.9.7	and he that rebuketh a wicked 
PRO.9.8	Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee:
PRO.9.8	rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
PRO.9.9	Give 
PRO.9.9	teach a just 
PRO.9.10	and the knowledge of the Holy 
PRO.9.11	For by me thy days shall be multiplied,
PRO.9.11	and the years of thy life shall be increased.
PRO.9.12	If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself:
PRO.9.12	but 
PRO.9.13	A foolish woman 
PRO.9.14	For she sitteth at the door of her house,
PRO.9.14	on a seat in the high places of the city,
PRO.9.15	to call passengers
PRO.9.15	who go right on their ways:
PRO.9.16	Whoso 
PRO.9.16	and 
PRO.9.17	Stolen waters are sweet,
PRO.9.17	and bread 
PRO.9.18	But he knoweth not that the dead 
PRO.10.1	The Proverbs of Solomon.
PRO.10.1	A wise son maketh a glad father:
PRO.10.1	but a foolish son 
PRO.10.2	Treasures of wickedness profit nothing:
PRO.10.2	but righteousness delivereth from death.
PRO.10.3	The 
PRO.10.3	but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.
PRO.10.4	He becometh poor that dealeth 
PRO.10.4	but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
PRO.10.5	He that gathereth in summer 
PRO.10.6	Blessings 
PRO.10.6	but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.10.7	The memory of the just 
PRO.10.7	but the name of the wicked shall rot.
PRO.10.8	The wise in heart will receive commandments:
PRO.10.8	but a prating fool shall fall.
PRO.10.9	He that walketh uprightly walketh surely:
PRO.10.9	but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.
PRO.10.10	He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow:
PRO.10.10	but a prating fool shall fall.
PRO.10.11	The mouth of a righteous 
PRO.10.11	but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.10.12	but love covereth all sins.
PRO.10.13	In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
PRO.10.13	but a rod 
PRO.10.14	Wise 
PRO.10.14	but the mouth of the foolish 
PRO.10.15	The rich man's wealth 
PRO.10.15	the destruction of the poor 
PRO.10.16	The labor of the righteous 
PRO.10.16	the fruit of the wicked to sin.
PRO.10.17	He 
PRO.10.17	but he that refuseth reproof erreth.
PRO.10.18	He that hideth hatred 
PRO.10.18	and he that uttereth a slander, 
PRO.10.19	In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin:
PRO.10.19	but he that refraineth his lips 
PRO.10.20	The tongue of the just 
PRO.10.20	the heart of the wicked 
PRO.10.21	The lips of the righteous feed many:
PRO.10.21	but fools die for want of wisdom.

PRO.10.23	but a man of understanding hath wisdom.
PRO.10.24	The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him:
PRO.10.24	but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
PRO.10.25	As the whirlwind passeth, so 
PRO.10.25	but the righteous 
PRO.10.26	As vinegar to the teeth,
PRO.10.26	and as smoke to the eyes,
PRO.10.26	so 
PRO.10.27	The fear of the

PRO.10.29	but destruction 
PRO.10.30	The righteous shall never be removed:
PRO.10.30	but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.
PRO.10.31	The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom:
PRO.10.31	but the froward tongue shall be cut out.
PRO.10.32	The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable:
PRO.10.32	but the mouth of the wicked 
PRO.11.1	A false balance 
PRO.11.1	but a just weight 
PRO.11.2	but with the lowly 
PRO.11.3	The integrity of the upright shall guide them:
PRO.11.3	but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.
PRO.11.4	Riches profit not in the day of wrath:
PRO.11.4	but righteousness delivereth from death.
PRO.11.5	The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way:
PRO.11.5	but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
PRO.11.6	The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them:
PRO.11.6	but transgressors shall be taken in 
PRO.11.7	When a wicked man dieth, 
PRO.11.7	and the hope of unjust 
PRO.11.8	The righteous is delivered out of trouble,
PRO.11.8	and the wicked cometh in his stead.
PRO.11.9	A hypocrite with

PRO.11.10	When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth:
PRO.11.10	and when the wicked perish, 
PRO.11.11	By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted:
PRO.11.11	but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.11.12	He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbor:
PRO.11.12	but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.
PRO.11.13	A talebearer revealeth secrets:
PRO.11.13	but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.
PRO.11.14	Where no counsel 
PRO.11.14	but in the multitude of counselors 
PRO.11.15	He that is surety for a stranger shall smart 
PRO.11.15	and he that hateth suretyship is sure.
PRO.11.16	A gracious woman retaineth honor:
PRO.11.16	and strong 
PRO.11.17	The merciful man doeth good to his own soul:
PRO.11.17	but 
PRO.11.18	The wicked worketh a deceitful work:
PRO.11.18	but to him that soweth righteousness 
PRO.11.19	As righteousness 
PRO.11.19	so he that pursueth evil 
PRO.11.20	They that are of a froward heart 
PRO.11.20	but 
PRO.11.21	but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
PRO.11.23	The desire of the righteous 
PRO.11.24	There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth;

PRO.14.14	The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways:
PRO.14.14	and a good man 
PRO.14.15	The simple believeth every word:
PRO.14.15	but the prudent 
PRO.14.16	A wise 
PRO.14.16	but the fool rageth, and is confident.
PRO.14.17	and a man of wicked devices is hated.

PRO.14.19	The evil bow before the good;
PRO.14.19	and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
PRO.14.20	The poor is hated even of his own neighbor:
PRO.14.20	but the rich

PRO.14.28	but in the want of people 
PRO.14.29	but

PRO.15.11	Hell
PRO.15.11	how much more then the hearts of the children of men?
PRO.15.12	A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him:
PRO.15.12	neither will he go unto the wise.
PRO.15.13	A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance:
PRO.15.13	but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.
PRO.15.14	The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
PRO.15.14	but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.
PRO.15.15	All the days of the afflicted 
PRO.15.15	but he that is of a merry heart 
PRO.15.16	Better 
PRO.15.16	than great treasure and trouble therewith.
PRO.15.17	Better 
PRO.15.17	than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
PRO.15.18	A wrathful man stirreth up strife:
PRO.15.18	but 
PRO.15.19	The way of the slothful 
PRO.15.19	but the way of the righteous 
PRO.15.20	A wise son maketh a glad father:
PRO.15.20	but a foolish man despiseth his mother.
PRO.15.21	Folly 
PRO.15.21	but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.
PRO.15.22	Without counsel purposes are disappointed:
PRO.15.22	but in the multitude of counselors they are established.
PRO.15.23	A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth:
PRO.15.23	and a word

PRO.15.24	that he may depart from hell
PRO.15.25	The 
PRO.15.25	but he will establish the border of the widow.
PRO.15.26	The thoughts of the wicked 
PRO.15.26	but 
PRO.15.27	He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house;
PRO.15.27	but he that hateth gifts shall live.
PRO.15.28	The heart of the righteous studieth to answer:
PRO.15.28	but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.
PRO.15.29	The 
PRO.15.29	but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.
PRO.15.30	The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart:
PRO.15.31	The ear that heareth the reproof of life
PRO.15.31	abideth among the wise.
PRO.15.32	He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul:
PRO.15.32	but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.
PRO.15.33	The fear of the 
PRO.15.33	and before honor 
PRO.16.1	The preparations of the heart in man,
PRO.16.1	and the answer of the tongue, 
PRO.16.2	All the ways of a man 
PRO.16.2	but the 
PRO.16.3	Commit thy works unto the 
PRO.16.3	and thy thoughts shall be established.
PRO.16.4	The 
PRO.16.4	yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.
PRO.16.5	Every one 
PRO.16.6	By mercy and truth iniquity is purged:
PRO.16.6	and by the fear of the 
PRO.16.7	When a man's ways please the 
PRO.16.7	he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
PRO.16.8	Better 
PRO.16.8	than great revenues without right.
PRO.16.9	A man's heart deviseth his way:
PRO.16.9	but the 
PRO.16.10	A divine sentence 
PRO.16.10	his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.
PRO.16.11	A just weight and balance 
PRO.16.11	all the weights of the bag 
PRO.16.12	for the throne is established by righteousness.
PRO.16.13	Righteous lips 
PRO.16.13	and they love him that speaketh right.
PRO.16.14	The wrath of a king 
PRO.16.14	but a wise man will pacify it.
PRO.16.15	In the light of the king's countenance 
PRO.16.15	and his favor 
PRO.16.16	How much better 
PRO.16.16	and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!
PRO.16.17	The highway of the upright 
PRO.16.17	he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
PRO.16.18	Pride 
PRO.16.18	and a haughty spirit before a fall.
PRO.16.19	Better 
PRO.16.19	than to divide the spoil with the proud.
PRO.16.20	He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good:
PRO.16.20	and whoso trusteth in the 
PRO.16.21	The wise in heart shall be called prudent:
PRO.16.21	and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
PRO.16.22	Understanding 
PRO.16.22	but the instruction of fools 
PRO.16.23	The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth,
PRO.16.23	and addeth learning to his lips.
PRO.16.24	Pleasant words 
PRO.16.24	sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
PRO.16.25	but the end thereof 
PRO.16.26	He that laboreth, laboreth for himself;
PRO.16.26	for his mouth craveth it of him.
PRO.16.27	An ungodly man diggeth up evil:
PRO.16.27	and in his lips 
PRO.16.28	A froward man soweth strife:
PRO.16.28	and a whisperer separateth chief friends.
PRO.16.29	A violent man enticeth his neighbor,
PRO.16.29	and leadeth him into the way 
PRO.16.30	He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things:
PRO.16.30	moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.
PRO.16.31	The hoary head 
PRO.16.32	and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
PRO.16.33	The lot is cast into the lap;
PRO.16.33	but the whole disposing thereof 
PRO.17.1	Better 
PRO.17.1	than a house full of sacrifices 
PRO.17.2	A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
PRO.17.2	and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
PRO.17.3	The fining pot 
PRO.17.3	but the 
PRO.17.4	A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips;
PRO.17.5	Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:
PRO.17.6	Children's children 
PRO.17.6	and the glory of children 
PRO.17.7	Excellent speech becometh not a fool:
PRO.17.7	much less do lying lips a prince.
PRO.17.8	A gift 
PRO.17.8	whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
PRO.17.9	He that covereth a transgression seeketh love;
PRO.17.9	but he that repeateth a matter separateth 
PRO.17.10	A reproof entereth more into a wise man
PRO.17.10	than a hundred stripes into a fool.
PRO.17.11	An evil 
PRO.17.11	therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
PRO.17.12	Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
PRO.17.12	rather than a fool in his folly.
PRO.17.13	Whoso rewardeth evil for good,
PRO.17.13	evil shall not depart from his house.
PRO.17.14	The beginning of strife 
PRO.17.14	therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
PRO.17.15	He that justifieth the wicked,
PRO.17.15	and he that condemneth the just,
PRO.17.15	even they both 
PRO.17.16	Wherefore 
PRO.17.16	seeing 
PRO.17.17	A friend loveth at all times,
PRO.17.17	and a brother is born for adversity.
PRO.17.18	A man void of understanding striketh hands,
PRO.17.19	He loveth transgression that loveth strife:
PRO.17.20	He that hath a froward heart findeth no good:
PRO.17.20	and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
PRO.17.21	He that begetteth a fool 
PRO.17.21	and the father of a fool hath no joy.
PRO.17.22	A merry heart doeth good 
PRO.17.22	but a broken spirit drieth the bones.
PRO.17.23	A wicked 
PRO.17.23	to pervert the ways of judgment.
PRO.17.24	Wisdom 
PRO.17.24	but the eyes of a fool 
PRO.17.25	A foolish son is a grief to his father,
PRO.17.25	and bitterness to her that bare him.
PRO.17.26	Also to punish the just 
PRO.17.27	He that hath knowledge spareth his words:
PRO.17.28	Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise:
PRO.18.1	Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh
PRO.18.2	A fool hath no delight in understanding,
PRO.18.2	but that his heart may discover itself.
PRO.18.3	When the wicked cometh, 
PRO.18.3	and with ignominy reproach.
PRO.18.4	The words of a man's mouth 
PRO.18.5	to overthrow the righteous in judgment.
PRO.18.6	A fool's lips enter into contention,
PRO.18.6	and his mouth calleth for strokes.
PRO.18.7	A fool's mouth 
PRO.18.7	and his lips 
PRO.18.8	The words of a talebearer 
PRO.18.8	and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
PRO.18.9	He also that is slothful in his work
PRO.18.9	is brother to him that is a great waster.
PRO.18.10	The name of the 
PRO.18.10	the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
PRO.18.11	The rich man's wealth 
PRO.18.11	and as a high wall in his own conceit.
PRO.18.12	Before destruction the heart of man is haughty;
PRO.18.12	and before honor 
PRO.18.13	He that answereth a matter before he heareth 
PRO.18.13	it 
PRO.18.14	The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;
PRO.18.14	but a wounded spirit who can bear?
PRO.18.15	The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge;
PRO.18.15	and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
PRO.18.16	A man's gift maketh room for him,
PRO.18.16	and bringeth him before great men.
PRO.18.17	but his neighbor cometh and searcheth him.
PRO.18.18	The lot causeth contentions to cease,
PRO.18.18	and parteth between the mighty.
PRO.18.19	A brother offended 
PRO.18.19	and 
PRO.18.20	A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
PRO.18.21	Death and life 
PRO.18.21	and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
PRO.18.22	and obtaineth favor of the 
PRO.18.23	The poor useth entreaties;
PRO.18.23	but the rich answereth roughly.
PRO.18.24	A man 
PRO.18.24	and there is a friend 
PRO.19.1	Better 
PRO.19.1	than 
PRO.19.2	Also, 
PRO.19.2	and he that hasteth with 
PRO.19.3	The foolishness of man perverteth his way:
PRO.19.3	and his heart fretteth against the 
PRO.19.4	Wealth maketh many friends;
PRO.19.4	but the poor is separated from his neighbor.
PRO.19.5	A false witness shall not be unpunished;
PRO.19.5	and 
PRO.19.6	Many will entreat the favor of the prince:
PRO.19.6	and every man 
PRO.19.7	All the brethren of the poor do hate him:
PRO.19.7	how much more do his friends go far from him?
PRO.19.7	He pursueth 
PRO.19.8	He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul:
PRO.19.8	he that keepeth understanding shall find good.
PRO.19.9	A false witness shall not be unpunished;
PRO.19.9	and 
PRO.19.10	Delight is not seemly for a fool;
PRO.19.10	much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
PRO.19.11	The discretion of a man deferreth his anger;
PRO.19.11	and 
PRO.19.12	The king's wrath 
PRO.19.12	but his favor 
PRO.19.13	A foolish son 
PRO.19.13	and the contentions of a wife 
PRO.19.14	House and riches 
PRO.19.14	and a prudent wife 
PRO.19.15	Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep;
PRO.19.15	and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.

PRO.19.17	He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the 
PRO.19.17	and that which he hath given will he pay him again.
PRO.19.18	Chasten thy son while there is hope,
PRO.19.18	and let not thy soul spare for his crying.
PRO.19.19	A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment:
PRO.19.19	for if thou deliver

PRO.19.25	Smite a scorner,
PRO.19.25	and the simple will beware:
PRO.19.25	and reprove one that hath understanding,

PRO.19.26	and bringeth reproach.
PRO.19.27	Cease, my son, to hear the instruction

PRO.19.28	and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.
PRO.19.29	Judgments are prepared for scorners,

PRO.20.7	The just 
PRO.20.7	his children

PRO.20.8	scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
PRO.20.9	Who can say, I have made my heart clean,

PRO.20.16	Take his garment that is surety 
PRO.20.16	and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
PRO.20.17	Bread of deceit 
PRO.20.17	but afterward his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
PRO.20.18	and with good advice make war.

PRO.20.28	and his throne is upholden by mercy.
PRO.20.29	The glory of young men 
PRO.20.29	and the beauty of old men

PRO.21.5	The thoughts of the diligent 
PRO.21.5	but of every one 
PRO.21.6	The getting of treasures by a lying tongue

PRO.21.7	because they refuse to do judgment.
PRO.21.8	The way of man

PRO.21.9	than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
PRO.21.10	The soul of the wicked desireth evil:

PRO.22.19	That thy trust may be in the 
PRO.22.19	I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.
PRO.22.20	Have not I written to thee excellent things
PRO.22.20	in counsels and knowledge,
PRO.22.21	that I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth;
PRO.22.21	that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?

PRO.22.27	If thou hast nothing to pay,
PRO.22.27	why should he take away thy bed from under thee?
PRO.22.28	Remove not the ancient landmark,
PRO.22.28	which thy fathers have set.
PRO.22.29	Seest thou a man diligent in his business?
PRO.22.29	He shall stand before kings;
PRO.22.29	he shall not stand before mean 
PRO.23.1	When thou sittest to eat with a ruler,
PRO.23.1	consider diligently what 
PRO.23.2	and put a knife to thy throat,
PRO.23.2	if thou 
PRO.23.3	Be not desirous of his dainties:
PRO.23.3	for they 
PRO.23.4	Labor not to be rich:
PRO.23.4	cease from thine own wisdom.
PRO.23.5	Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not?
PRO.23.5	For 
PRO.23.5	they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
PRO.23.6	Eat thou not the bread of

PRO.23.9	Speak not in the ears of a fool:
PRO.23.9	for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.
PRO.23.10	Remove not the old landmark;
PRO.23.10	and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:
PRO.23.11	for their Redeemer 
PRO.23.11	he shall plead their cause with thee.
PRO.23.12	Apply thine heart unto instruction,
PRO.23.12	and thine ears to the words of knowledge.
PRO.23.13	Withhold not correction from the child:
PRO.23.13	for 
PRO.23.14	Thou shalt beat him with the rod,
PRO.23.14	and shalt deliver his soul from hell.
PRO.23.15	My son, if thine heart be wise,
PRO.23.15	my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
PRO.23.16	Yea, my reins shall rejoice,
PRO.23.16	when thy lips speak right things.
PRO.23.17	Let not thine heart envy sinners;
PRO.23.17	but 
PRO.23.18	For surely there is an end;
PRO.23.18	and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
PRO.23.19	Hear thou, my son, and be wise,
PRO.23.19	and guide thine heart in the way.
PRO.23.20	Be not among winebibbers;
PRO.23.20	among riotous eaters of flesh:
PRO.23.21	for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty:
PRO.23.21	and drowsiness shall clothe 
PRO.23.22	Hearken unto thy father that begat thee,
PRO.23.22	and despise not thy mother when she is old.
PRO.23.23	Buy the truth, and sell 
PRO.23.24	The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice:
PRO.23.24	and he that begetteth a wise 
PRO.23.25	Thy father and thy mother shall be glad,
PRO.23.25	and she that bare thee shall rejoice.
PRO.23.26	My son, give me thine heart,
PRO.23.26	and let thine eyes observe my ways.
PRO.23.27	For a whore 
PRO.23.27	and a strange woman 
PRO.23.28	She also lieth in wait as 
PRO.23.28	and increaseth the transgressors among men.
PRO.23.29	Who hath woe?
PRO.23.29	Who hath sorrow?
PRO.23.29	Who hath contentions?
PRO.23.29	Who hath babbling?
PRO.23.29	Who hath wounds without cause?
PRO.23.29	Who hath redness of eyes?
PRO.23.30	They that tarry long at the wine;
PRO.23.30	they that go to seek mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,
PRO.23.31	when it giveth his color in the cup,
PRO.23.32	At the last it biteth like a serpent,
PRO.23.32	and stingeth like an adder.
PRO.23.33	Thine eyes shall behold strange women,
PRO.23.33	and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
PRO.23.34	Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea,
PRO.23.34	or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
PRO.23.35	They have stricken me, 
PRO.23.35	they have beaten me, 
PRO.23.35	when shall I awake?
PRO.23.35	I will seek it yet again.
PRO.24.1	Be not thou envious against evil men,
PRO.24.1	neither desire to be with them:
PRO.24.2	for their heart studieth destruction,
PRO.24.2	and their lips talk of mischief.
PRO.24.3	Through wisdom is a house builded;
PRO.24.3	and by understanding it is established:
PRO.24.4	and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled
PRO.24.4	with all precious and pleasant riches.
PRO.24.5	A wise man 
PRO.24.5	yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
PRO.24.6	For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war:
PRO.24.6	and in multitude of counselors 
PRO.24.7	Wisdom 
PRO.24.7	he openeth not his mouth in the gate.
PRO.24.8	He that deviseth to do evil
PRO.24.8	shall be called a mischievous person.
PRO.24.9	The thought of foolishness 
PRO.24.9	and the scorner 
PRO.24.10	thy strength 
PRO.24.11	If thou forbear to deliver 
PRO.24.11	and 
PRO.24.12	if thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not;
PRO.24.12	doth not he that pondereth the heart consider 
PRO.24.12	And he that keepeth thy soul, doth 
PRO.24.12	And shall 
PRO.24.13	My son, eat thou honey, because 
PRO.24.13	and the honeycomb, 
PRO.24.14	so 
PRO.24.14	when thou hast found 
PRO.24.14	and thy expectation shall not be cut off.
PRO.24.15	Lay not wait, O wicked 
PRO.24.15	spoil not his resting place:
PRO.24.16	for a just 
PRO.24.16	but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
PRO.24.17	Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,
PRO.24.17	and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:
PRO.24.18	lest the 
PRO.24.18	and he turn away his wrath from him.
PRO.24.19	Fret not thyself because of evil 
PRO.24.19	neither be thou envious at the wicked;
PRO.24.20	for there shall be no reward to the evil 
PRO.24.20	the candle of the wicked shall be put out.
PRO.24.21	My son, fear thou the 
PRO.24.22	for their calamity shall rise suddenly;
PRO.24.22	and who knoweth the ruin of them both?
PRO.24.23	These 
PRO.24.24	He that saith unto the wicked, Thou 
PRO.24.24	him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:
PRO.24.25	but to them that rebuke 
PRO.24.25	and a good blessing shall come upon them.
PRO.24.26	that giveth a right answer.
PRO.24.27	Prepare thy work without,
PRO.24.27	and make it fit for thyself in the field;
PRO.24.27	and afterward build thine house.
PRO.24.28	Be not a witness against thy neighbor without cause;
PRO.24.28	and deceive 
PRO.24.29	Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me:
PRO.24.29	I will render to the man according to his work.
PRO.24.30	I went by the field of the slothful,
PRO.24.30	and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
PRO.24.31	and, lo, it was all grown over with thorns,
PRO.24.31	and the stone wall thereof was broken down.
PRO.24.32	Then I saw, 
PRO.24.32	I looked upon 
PRO.24.33	a little folding of the hands to sleep:
PRO.24.34	so shall thy poverty come 
PRO.24.34	and thy want as an armed man.
PRO.25.1	These 
PRO.25.2	but the honor of kings 
PRO.25.3	The heaven for height,
PRO.25.3	and the earth for depth,
PRO.25.3	and the heart of kings 
PRO.25.4	Take away the dross from the silver,
PRO.25.4	and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
PRO.25.5	Take away the wicked 
PRO.25.5	and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	and stand not in the place of great 
PRO.25.7	for better 
PRO.25.7	than that thou shouldest be put lower
PRO.25.7	in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.
PRO.25.8	Go not forth hastily to strive,
PRO.25.8	lest 
PRO.25.8	when thy neighbor hath put thee to shame.
PRO.25.9	Debate thy cause with thy neighbor 
PRO.25.9	and discover not a secret to another:
PRO.25.10	lest he that heareth 
PRO.25.10	and thine infamy turn not away.
PRO.25.11	A word fitly spoken
PRO.25.13	As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
PRO.25.13	for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
PRO.25.14	Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift
PRO.25.15	By long forbearing is a prince persuaded,
PRO.25.15	and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
PRO.25.16	Hast thou found honey?
PRO.25.16	Eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
PRO.25.16	lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
PRO.25.17	Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbor's house;
PRO.25.17	lest he be weary of thee, and 
PRO.25.18	A man that beareth false witness against his neighbor
PRO.25.19	Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble
PRO.25.20	so 
PRO.25.21	and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
PRO.25.22	for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,
PRO.25.22	and the 
PRO.25.23	The north wind driveth away rain:
PRO.25.23	so 
PRO.25.24	than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
PRO.25.25	so 
PRO.25.26	A righteous man falling down before the wicked
PRO.25.27	so 
PRO.25.28	He that 
PRO.26.1	As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
PRO.26.1	so honor is not seemly for a fool.
PRO.26.2	As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying,
PRO.26.2	so the curse causeless shall not come.
PRO.26.3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
PRO.26.3	and a rod for the fool's back.
PRO.26.4	Answer not a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.4	lest thou also be like unto him.
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.5	lest he be wise in his own conceit.
PRO.26.6	He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool
PRO.26.6	cutteth off the feet, 
PRO.26.7	The legs of the lame are not equal:
PRO.26.7	so 
PRO.26.8	As he that bindeth a stone in a sling,
PRO.26.8	so 
PRO.26.9	so 
PRO.26.10	The great 
PRO.26.10	both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.
PRO.26.12	Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?
PRO.26.13	The slothful 
PRO.26.13	a lion 
PRO.26.14	so 
PRO.26.15	The slothful hideth his hand in 
PRO.26.15	it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.
PRO.26.16	The sluggard 
PRO.26.16	than seven men that can render a reason.
PRO.26.17	He that passeth by, 
PRO.26.18	As a mad 
PRO.26.19	so 
PRO.26.19	and saith, Am not I in sport?
PRO.26.20	Where no wood is, 
PRO.26.20	so where 
PRO.26.21	so 
PRO.26.22	The words of a talebearer 
PRO.26.22	and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
PRO.26.23	Burning lips and a wicked heart
PRO.26.24	He that hateth dissembleth with his lips,
PRO.26.24	and layeth up deceit within him;
PRO.26.25	when he speaketh fair, believe him not:
PRO.26.25	for 
PRO.26.26	his wickedness shall be showed before the 
PRO.26.27	Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein:
PRO.26.27	and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hateth 
PRO.26.28	and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
PRO.27.1	for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
PRO.27.2	Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;
PRO.27.2	a stranger, and not thine own lips.
PRO.27.3	A stone 
PRO.27.3	but a fool's wrath 
PRO.27.4	Wrath 
PRO.27.4	but who 
PRO.27.5	Open rebuke 
PRO.27.6	Faithful 
PRO.27.6	but the kisses of an enemy 
PRO.27.7	The full soul loatheth a honeycomb;
PRO.27.7	but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
PRO.27.8	As a bird that wandereth from her nest,
PRO.27.8	so 
PRO.27.9	Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart:
PRO.27.9	so 
PRO.27.10	Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
PRO.27.10	neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity:
PRO.27.10	than a brother far off.
PRO.27.11	My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
PRO.27.11	that I may answer him that reproacheth me.
PRO.27.12	A prudent 
PRO.27.13	Take his garment that is surety for a stranger,
PRO.27.13	and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
PRO.27.14	He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice,
PRO.27.14	rising early in the morning,
PRO.27.14	it shall be counted a curse to him.
PRO.27.15	A continual dropping in a very rainy day
PRO.27.15	and a contentious woman are alike.
PRO.27.16	Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind,
PRO.27.16	and the ointment of his right hand, 
PRO.27.17	Iron sharpeneth iron;
PRO.27.17	so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
PRO.27.18	Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof:
PRO.27.18	so he that waiteth on his master shall be honored.
PRO.27.19	As in water face 
PRO.27.19	so the heart of man to man.
PRO.27.20	Hell and destruction are never full;
PRO.27.20	so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
PRO.27.21	so 
PRO.27.22	Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle,
PRO.27.23	Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,
PRO.27.24	for riches 
PRO.27.24	and doth the crown 
PRO.27.25	The hay appeareth,
PRO.27.25	and the tender grass showeth itself,
PRO.27.25	and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
PRO.27.26	The lambs 
PRO.27.26	and the goats 
PRO.27.27	And 
PRO.27.27	for the food of thy household,
PRO.27.27	and 
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no man pursueth:
PRO.28.1	but the righteous are bold as a lion.
PRO.28.2	For the transgression of a land
PRO.28.2	many 
PRO.28.2	but by a man of understanding 
PRO.28.2	the state 
PRO.28.3	A poor man that oppresseth the poor
PRO.28.4	They that forsake the law praise the wicked:
PRO.28.4	but such as keep the law contend with them.
PRO.28.5	Evil men understand not judgment:
PRO.28.5	but they that seek the 
PRO.28.6	Better 
PRO.28.6	than 
PRO.28.7	Whoso keepeth the law 
PRO.28.7	but he that is a companion of riotous 
PRO.28.8	He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance,
PRO.28.8	he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
PRO.28.9	He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,
PRO.28.9	even his prayer 
PRO.28.10	Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way,
PRO.28.10	he shall fall himself into his own pit:
PRO.28.10	but the upright shall have good 
PRO.28.11	The rich man 
PRO.28.11	but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
PRO.28.12	When righteous 
PRO.28.12	but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.
PRO.28.13	He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:
PRO.28.13	but whoso confesseth and forsaketh 
PRO.28.14	Happy 
PRO.28.14	but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
PRO.28.16	The prince that wanteth understanding 
PRO.28.17	A man that doeth violence to the blood of 
PRO.28.17	let no man stay him.
PRO.28.18	Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved:
PRO.28.18	but 
PRO.28.19	He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread:
PRO.28.19	but he that followeth after vain 
PRO.28.20	A faithful man shall abound with blessings:
PRO.28.20	but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
PRO.28.21	To have respect of persons

PRO.28.22	He that hasteth to be rich 
PRO.28.22	and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.
PRO.28.23	He that rebuketh a man, afterward shall find more favor
PRO.28.23	than he that flattereth with the tongue.
PRO.28.24	Whoso robbeth his father or his mother,
PRO.28.24	and saith, 
PRO.28.24	the same 
PRO.28.25	He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife:
PRO.28.25	but he that putteth his trust in the 
PRO.28.26	He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:
PRO.28.26	but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
PRO.28.27	He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack:
PRO.28.27	but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked rise, men hide themselves:
PRO.28.28	but when they perish, the righteous increase.

PRO.29.1	shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.
PRO.29.2	When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice:
PRO.29.2	but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.
PRO.29.3	Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father:
PRO.29.3	but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth 
PRO.29.4	The king by judgment establisheth the land:
PRO.29.4	but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.
PRO.29.5	A man that flattereth his neighbor
PRO.29.5	spreadeth a net for his feet.
PRO.29.6	In the transgression of an evil man 
PRO.29.6	but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.
PRO.29.7	The righteous considereth the cause of the poor:
PRO.29.8	Scornful men bring a city into a snare:
PRO.29.8	but wise 
PRO.29.9	whether he rage or laugh, 
PRO.29.10	The bloodthirsty hate the upright:

PRO.29.15	The rod and reproof give wisdom:
PRO.29.15	but a child left 
PRO.29.16	When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth:
PRO.29.16	but the righteous shall see their fall.
PRO.29.17	Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest;

PRO.30.1	The man spake unto Ith´i-el,
PRO.30.1	even unto Ith´i-el and Ucal,
PRO.30.2	Surely I 
PRO.30.2	and have not the understanding of a man.
PRO.30.3	I neither learned wisdom,
PRO.30.3	nor have the knowledge of the holy.
PRO.30.4	Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended?
PRO.30.4	Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?
PRO.30.4	Who hath bound the waters in a garment?

PRO.30.6	lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
PRO.30.7	Two 
PRO.30.7	deny me 
PRO.30.8	remove far from me vanity and lies;
PRO.30.8	give me neither poverty nor riches;
PRO.30.8	feed me with food convenient for me:
PRO.30.9	lest I be full, and deny 
PRO.30.9	and say, Who 
PRO.30.9	or lest I be poor, and steal,
PRO.30.9	and take the name of my God 
PRO.30.10	Accuse not a servant unto his master,
PRO.30.10	lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
PRO.30.11	and doth not bless their mother.
PRO.30.12	and 
PRO.30.13	And their eyelids are lifted up.
PRO.30.14	and their jaw teeth 
PRO.30.14	to devour the poor from off the earth,
PRO.30.14	and the needy from 
PRO.30.15	The horseleech hath two daughters, 
PRO.30.15	There are three 
PRO.30.16	the grave; and the barren womb;
PRO.30.16	the earth 
PRO.30.16	and the fire 
PRO.30.17	The eye 
PRO.30.17	and despiseth to obey 
PRO.30.17	the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
PRO.30.17	and the young eagles shall eat it.
PRO.30.18	There be three 
PRO.30.18	yea, four which I know not:
PRO.30.19	the way of an eagle in the air;
PRO.30.19	the way of a serpent upon a rock;
PRO.30.19	the way of a ship in the midst of the sea;
PRO.30.19	and the way of a man with a maid.
PRO.30.20	Such 
PRO.30.20	she eateth, and wipeth her mouth,
PRO.30.20	and saith, I have done no wickedness.
PRO.30.21	For three 
PRO.30.21	and for four 
PRO.30.22	for a servant when he reigneth;
PRO.30.22	and a fool when he is filled with meat;
PRO.30.23	for an odious 
PRO.30.23	and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
PRO.30.24	There be four 
PRO.30.24	but they 
PRO.30.25	the ants 
PRO.30.25	yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
PRO.30.26	the conies 
PRO.30.26	yet make they their houses in the rocks;
PRO.30.27	the locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	yet go they forth all of them by bands;
PRO.30.28	the spider taketh hold with her hands,
PRO.30.28	and is in kings' palaces.
PRO.30.29	There be three 
PRO.30.29	yea, four are comely in going:
PRO.30.30	a lion, 
PRO.30.30	and turneth not away for any;
PRO.30.31	a greyhound; a he goat also;
PRO.30.31	and a king, against whom 
PRO.30.32	If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself,
PRO.30.32	or if thou hast thought evil,
PRO.30.33	Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,
PRO.30.33	and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood:
PRO.30.33	so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
PRO.31.1	The words of king Lem´u-el, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
PRO.31.2	What, my son?
PRO.31.2	And what, the son of my womb?
PRO.31.2	And what, the son of my vows?
PRO.31.3	Give not thy strength unto women,
PRO.31.3	nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
PRO.31.4	nor for princes strong drink:
PRO.31.5	lest they drink, and forget the law,
PRO.31.5	and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,
PRO.31.6	and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
PRO.31.7	Let him drink, and forget his poverty,
PRO.31.7	and remember his misery no more.
PRO.31.8	Open thy mouth for the dumb
PRO.31.8	in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
PRO.31.9	Open thy mouth, judge righteously,
PRO.31.9	and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
PRO.31.10	Who can find a virtuous woman?
PRO.31.10	For her price 
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her,
PRO.31.11	so that he shall have no need of spoil.
PRO.31.12	She will do him good and not evil
PRO.31.12	all the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She seeketh wool, and flax,
PRO.31.13	and worketh willingly with her hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like the merchants' ships;
PRO.31.14	she bringeth her food from afar.
PRO.31.15	She riseth also while it is yet night,
PRO.31.15	and giveth meat to her household,
PRO.31.15	and a portion to her maidens.
PRO.31.16	She considereth a field, and buyeth it:
PRO.31.16	with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She girdeth her loins with strength,
PRO.31.17	and strengtheneth her arms.
PRO.31.18	She perceiveth that her merchandise 
PRO.31.18	her candle goeth not out by night.
PRO.31.19	She layeth her hands to the spindle,
PRO.31.19	and her hands hold the distaff.
PRO.31.20	She stretcheth our her hand to the poor;
PRO.31.20	yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid of the snow for her household:
PRO.31.21	for all her household 
PRO.31.22	She maketh herself coverings of tapestry;
PRO.31.22	her clothing 
PRO.31.23	Her husband is known in the gates,
PRO.31.23	when he sitteth among the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She maketh fine linen, and selleth 
PRO.31.24	and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
PRO.31.25	Strength and honor 
PRO.31.25	and she shall rejoice in time to come.
PRO.31.26	She openeth her mouth with wisdom;
PRO.31.26	and in her tongue 
PRO.31.27	She looketh well to the ways of her household,
PRO.31.27	and eateth not the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	Her children arise up, and call her blessed;
PRO.31.28	her husband 
PRO.31.29	Many daughters have done virtuously,
PRO.31.29	but thou excellest them all.
PRO.31.30	Favor 
PRO.31.31	Give her of the fruit of her hands;
PRO.31.31	and let her own works praise her in the gates.
ECC.1.1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.2	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all 
ECC.1.3	What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun? 
ECC.1.4	 generation passeth away, and 
ECC.1.5	The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. 
ECC.1.6	The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. 
ECC.1.7	All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea 
ECC.1.8	All things 
ECC.1.9	The thing that hath been, it 
ECC.1.10	Is there 
ECC.1.11	 no remembrance of former 
ECC.1.12	I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all 
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all 
ECC.1.15	 crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
ECC.1.17	And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 
ECC.1.18	For in much wisdom 
ECC.2.1	I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also 
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, 
ECC.2.3	I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what 
ECC.2.4	 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 
ECC.2.5	I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all 
ECC.2.6	I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 
ECC.2.7	I got 
ECC.2.8	I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, 
ECC.2.9	So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. 
ECC.2.10	And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor: and this was my portion of all my labor. 
ECC.2.11	Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all 
ECC.2.12	And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what 
ECC.2.13	Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. 
ECC.2.14	The wise man's eyes 
ECC.2.15	Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also 
ECC.2.16	For 
ECC.2.17	Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun 
ECC.2.18	Yea, I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. 
ECC.2.19	And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise 
ECC.2.20	Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor which I took under the sun. 
ECC.2.21	For there is a man whose labor 
ECC.2.22	For what hath man of all his labor, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath labored under the sun? 
ECC.2.23	For all his days 
ECC.2.25	For who can eat, or who else can hasten 
ECC.2.26	For 
ECC.3.1	To every 
ECC.3.2	a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up 
ECC.3.3	a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; 
ECC.3.4	a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; 
ECC.3.5	a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; 
ECC.3.6	a time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; 
ECC.3.7	a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; 
ECC.3.8	a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. 
ECC.3.9	What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?
ECC.3.10	I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. 
ECC.3.11	He hath made every 
ECC.3.12	I know that 
ECC.3.13	And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor, it 
ECC.3.14	I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth 
ECC.3.15	That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
ECC.3.16	And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, 
ECC.3.17	I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for 
ECC.3.18	I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. 
ECC.3.19	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast: for all 
ECC.3.20	All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. 
ECC.3.21	Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? 
ECC.3.22	Wherefore I perceive that 
ECC.4.1	So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of 
ECC.4.2	Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead, more than the living which are yet alive. 
ECC.4.3	Yea, better 
ECC.4.4	Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This 
ECC.4.5	The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
ECC.4.6	Better 
ECC.4.7	Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. 
ECC.4.8	There is one 
ECC.4.9	Two 
ECC.4.10	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him 
ECC.4.11	Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm 
ECC.4.12	And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
ECC.4.13	Better 
ECC.4.14	For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also 
ECC.4.15	I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. 
ECC.4.16	 no end of all the people, 
ECC.5.1	Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. 
ECC.5.2	Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter 
ECC.5.3	For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice 
ECC.5.4	When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for 
ECC.5.5	Better 
ECC.5.6	Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel,
ECC.5.7	For in the multitude of dreams and many words 
ECC.5.8	If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for 
ECC.5.9	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king 
ECC.5.10	He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this 
ECC.5.11	When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good 
ECC.5.12	The sleep of a laboring man 
ECC.5.13	There is a sore evil 
ECC.5.14	But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and 
ECC.5.15	As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labor, which he may carry away in his hand. 
ECC.5.16	And this also 
ECC.5.17	All his days also he eateth in darkness, and 
ECC.5.18	Behold 
ECC.5.19	Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this 
ECC.5.20	For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth 
ECC.6.1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it 
ECC.6.2	a man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honor, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this 
ECC.6.3	If a man beget a hundred 
ECC.6.4	For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness. 
ECC.6.5	Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known 
ECC.6.6	Yea, though he live a thousand years twice 
ECC.6.7	All the labor of man 
ECC.6.8	For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? 
ECC.6.9	Better 
ECC.6.10	That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it 
ECC.6.11	Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what 
ECC.6.12	For who knoweth what 
ECC.7.1	A good name 
ECC.7.2	 better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that 
ECC.7.3	Sorrow 
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise 
ECC.7.5	 better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. 
ECC.7.6	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so 
ECC.7.7	Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. 
ECC.7.8	Better 
ECC.7.9	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. 
ECC.7.10	Say not thou, What is 
ECC.7.11	Wisdom 
ECC.7.12	For wisdom 
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God: for who can make 
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
ECC.7.15	All 
ECC.7.16	Be not righteous over much, neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? 
ECC.7.17	Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? 
ECC.7.18	 good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.
ECC.7.19	Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty 
ECC.7.20	For 
ECC.7.21	Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: 
ECC.7.22	for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
ECC.7.23	All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it 
ECC.7.24	That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? 
ECC.7.25	I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason 
ECC.7.26	and I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart 
ECC.7.27	Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, 
ECC.7.28	which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. 
ECC.7.29	Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
ECC.8.1	Who 
ECC.8.2	I 
ECC.8.3	Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 
ECC.8.4	Where the word of a king 
ECC.8.5	Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment. 
ECC.8.6	Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man 
ECC.8.7	For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? 
ECC.8.8	 no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither 
ECC.8.9	All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: 
ECC.8.10	And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this 
ECC.8.11	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 
ECC.8.12	Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and his 
ECC.8.13	but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong 
ECC.8.14	There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just 
ECC.8.15	Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
ECC.8.16	When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also 
ECC.8.17	then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labor to seek 
ECC.9.1	For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, 
ECC.9.2	All 
ECC.9.3	This 
ECC.9.4	For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion. 
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. 
ECC.9.6	Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any 
ECC.9.7	Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.
ECC.9.8	Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.
ECC.9.9	Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that 
ECC.9.10	Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do 
ECC.9.11	I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race 
ECC.9.12	For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so 
ECC.9.13	This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it 
ECC.9.14	 a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it. 
ECC.9.15	Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. 
ECC.9.16	Then said I, Wisdom 
ECC.9.17	The words of wise 
ECC.9.18	Wisdom 
ECC.10.1	Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savor: 
ECC.10.2	A wise man's heart 
ECC.10.3	Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth 
ECC.10.4	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offenses.
ECC.10.5	There is an evil 
ECC.10.6	folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. 
ECC.10.7	I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. 
ECC.10.8	He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him. 
ECC.10.9	Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; 
ECC.10.10	If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom 
ECC.10.11	Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.
ECC.10.12	The words of a wise man's mouth 
ECC.10.13	The beginning of the words of his mouth 
ECC.10.14	A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? 
ECC.10.15	The labor of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.
ECC.10.16	Woe to thee, O land, when thy king 
ECC.10.17	Blessed 
ECC.10.18	By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. 
ECC.10.19	A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all 
ECC.10.20	Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
ECC.11.1	Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 
ECC.11.2	Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 
ECC.11.3	If the clouds be full of rain, they empty 
ECC.11.4	He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 
ECC.11.5	As thou knowest not what 
ECC.11.6	In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both 
ECC.11.7	Truly the light 
ECC.11.8	but if a man live many years, 
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these 
ECC.11.10	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth 
ECC.12.1	Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; 
ECC.12.2	while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: 
ECC.12.3	in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, 
ECC.12.4	and the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; 
ECC.12.5	also 
ECC.12.6	or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. 
ECC.12.7	Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. 
ECC.12.8	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all 
ECC.12.9	And moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, 
ECC.12.10	The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and 
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise 
ECC.12.12	And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books 
ECC.12.13	Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this 
ECC.12.14	For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether 
SNG.1.2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth:
SNG.1.2	for thy love 
SNG.1.3	Because of the savor of thy good ointments
SNG.1.3	thy name 
SNG.1.3	therefore do the virgins love thee.
SNG.1.4	Draw me, we will run after thee:
SNG.1.4	the King hath brought me into his chambers:
SNG.1.4	we will be glad and rejoice in thee,
SNG.1.4	we will remember thy love more than wine:
SNG.1.4	the upright love thee.
SNG.1.5	I 
SNG.1.5	as the tents of Kedar,
SNG.1.5	as the curtains of Solomon.
SNG.1.6	Look not upon me, because I 
SNG.1.6	because the sun hath looked upon me:
SNG.1.6	my mother's children were angry with me;
SNG.1.6	they made me the keeper of the vineyards;
SNG.1.7	Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest,
SNG.1.7	where thou makest 
SNG.1.7	for why should I be as one that turneth aside
SNG.1.7	by the flocks of thy companions?
SNG.1.8	If thou know not, O thou fairest among women,
SNG.1.8	go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock,
SNG.1.8	and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.
SNG.1.9	I have compared thee, O my love,
SNG.1.9	to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.
SNG.1.10	Thy cheeks are comely with rows 
SNG.1.10	thy neck with chains 
SNG.1.11	We will make thee borders of gold
SNG.1.11	with studs of silver.
SNG.1.12	While the King 
SNG.1.12	my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
SNG.1.13	A bundle of myrrh 
SNG.1.13	he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.
SNG.1.14	My beloved 
SNG.1.14	in the vineyards of En–ge´di.
SNG.1.15	Behold, thou 
SNG.1.15	behold, thou 
SNG.1.15	thou 
SNG.1.16	Behold, thou 
SNG.1.16	also our bed 
SNG.1.17	The beams of our house 
SNG.2.1	I 
SNG.2.2	As the lily among thorns,
SNG.2.2	so 
SNG.2.3	As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,
SNG.2.3	so 
SNG.2.3	I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
SNG.2.3	and his fruit 
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the banqueting house,
SNG.2.4	and his banner over me 
SNG.2.5	Stay me with flagons,
SNG.2.5	comfort me with apples:
SNG.2.5	for I 
SNG.2.6	His left hand 
SNG.2.6	and his right hand doth embrace me.
SNG.2.7	I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.2.7	by the roes, and by the hinds of the field,
SNG.2.7	that ye stir not up, nor awake 
SNG.2.7	till he please.
SNG.2.8	The voice of my beloved!
SNG.2.8	Behold, he cometh
SNG.2.8	leaping upon the mountains,
SNG.2.8	skipping upon the hills.
SNG.2.9	My beloved is like a roe or a young hart:
SNG.2.9	behold, he standeth behind our wall,
SNG.2.9	he looketh forth at the windows,
SNG.2.9	showing himself through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My beloved spake, and said unto me,
SNG.2.10	Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
SNG.2.11	For, lo, the winter is past,
SNG.2.11	the rain is over 
SNG.2.12	the flowers appear on the earth;
SNG.2.12	the time of the singing 
SNG.2.12	and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
SNG.2.13	the fig tree putteth forth her green figs,
SNG.2.13	and the vines 
SNG.2.13	Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
SNG.2.14	O my dove, 
SNG.2.14	in the secret 
SNG.2.14	let me see thy countenance,
SNG.2.14	let me hear thy voice;
SNG.2.14	for sweet 
SNG.2.14	and thy countenance 
SNG.2.15	Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines:
SNG.2.15	for our vines 
SNG.2.16	My beloved 
SNG.2.16	he feedeth among the lilies.
SNG.2.17	Until the day break,
SNG.2.17	and the shadows flee away,
SNG.2.17	turn, my beloved,
SNG.2.17	and be thou like a roe or a young hart
SNG.2.17	upon the mountains of Bether.
SNG.3.1	By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth:
SNG.3.1	I sought him, but I found him not.
SNG.3.2	I will rise now, and go about the city
SNG.3.2	in the streets, and in the broad ways
SNG.3.2	I will seek him whom my soul loveth:
SNG.3.2	I sought him, but I found him not.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen that go about the city found me:
SNG.3.4	but I found him whom my soul loveth:
SNG.3.4	I held him, and would not let him go,
SNG.3.4	until I had brought him into my mother's house,
SNG.3.4	and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
SNG.3.5	I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.3.5	by the roes, and by the hinds of the field,
SNG.3.5	that ye stir not up, nor awake 
SNG.3.5	till he please.
SNG.3.6	Who 
SNG.3.6	perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
SNG.3.6	with all powders of the merchant?
SNG.3.7	Behold his bed, which 
SNG.3.7	threescore valiant men 
SNG.3.7	of the valiant of Israel.
SNG.3.8	They all hold swords,
SNG.3.8	every man 
SNG.3.8	because of fear in the night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon made himself a chariot
SNG.3.9	of the wood of Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	He made the pillars thereof 
SNG.3.10	the bottom thereof 
SNG.3.10	the covering of it 
SNG.3.10	the midst thereof being paved 
SNG.3.10	for the daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon
SNG.3.11	with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him
SNG.3.11	in the day of his espousals,
SNG.3.11	and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
SNG.4.1	Behold, thou 
SNG.4.1	behold, thou 
SNG.4.1	thou 
SNG.4.1	thy hair 
SNG.4.1	that appear from mount Gil´e-ad.
SNG.4.2	Thy teeth 
SNG.4.2	which came up from the washing;
SNG.4.2	whereof every one bear twins,
SNG.4.2	and none 
SNG.4.3	Thy lips 
SNG.4.3	and thy speech 
SNG.4.3	thy temples 
SNG.4.4	Thy neck 
SNG.4.4	whereon there hang a thousand bucklers,
SNG.4.4	all shields of mighty men.
SNG.4.5	Thy two breasts 
SNG.4.5	which feed among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Until the day break,
SNG.4.6	and the shadows flee away,
SNG.4.6	I will get me to the mountain of myrrh,
SNG.4.6	and to the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	Thou 
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon, 
SNG.4.8	with me from Lebanon:
SNG.4.8	look from the top of Ama´na,
SNG.4.8	from the top of Shenir and Hermon,
SNG.4.8	from the lions' dens,
SNG.4.8	from the mountains of the leopards.
SNG.4.9	Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, 
SNG.4.9	thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
SNG.4.9	with one chain of thy neck.
SNG.4.10	How fair is thy love, my sister, 
SNG.4.10	How much better is thy love than wine!
SNG.4.10	and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
SNG.4.11	Thy lips, O 
SNG.4.11	honey and milk 
SNG.4.11	and the smell of thy garments 
SNG.4.12	A garden inclosed 
SNG.4.12	a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
SNG.4.13	Thy plants 
SNG.4.13	camphire, with spikenard,
SNG.4.14	spikenard and saffron;
SNG.4.14	calamus and cinnamon,
SNG.4.14	with all trees of frankincense;
SNG.4.14	myrrh and aloes,
SNG.4.14	with all the chief spices:
SNG.4.15	a fountain of gardens,
SNG.4.15	a well of living waters,
SNG.4.15	and streams from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awake, O north wind;
SNG.4.16	and come, thou south;
SNG.4.16	blow upon my garden,
SNG.4.16	Let my beloved come into his garden,
SNG.4.16	and eat his pleasant fruits.
SNG.5.1	I am come into my garden, my sister, 
SNG.5.1	I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;
SNG.5.1	I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
SNG.5.1	I have drunk my wine with my milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, O friends; drink,
SNG.5.1	yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
SNG.5.2	I sleep, but my heart waketh:
SNG.5.2	Open to me, my sister, my love,
SNG.5.2	my dove, my undefiled:
SNG.5.2	for my head is filled with dew,
SNG.5.3	I have put off my coat;
SNG.5.3	how shall I put it on?
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet;
SNG.5.3	how shall I defile them?
SNG.5.4	My beloved put in his hand by the hole 
SNG.5.4	and my bowels were moved for him.
SNG.5.5	I rose up to open to my beloved;
SNG.5.5	and my hands dropped 
SNG.5.5	and my fingers 
SNG.5.5	upon the handles of the lock.
SNG.5.6	I opened to my beloved;
SNG.5.6	but my beloved had withdrawn himself, 
SNG.5.6	my soul failed when he spake:
SNG.5.6	I sought him, but I could not find him;
SNG.5.6	I called him, but he gave me no answer.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen that went about the city found me,
SNG.5.7	they smote me, they wounded me;
SNG.5.7	the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
SNG.5.8	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.8	if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him,
SNG.5.8	that I 
SNG.5.9	What 
SNG.5.9	O thou fairest among women?
SNG.5.9	What 
SNG.5.9	that thou dost so charge us?
SNG.5.10	My beloved 
SNG.5.10	the chiefest among ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head 
SNG.5.11	his locks 
SNG.5.12	his eyes 
SNG.5.12	washed with milk, 
SNG.5.13	his cheeks 
SNG.5.13	his lips 
SNG.5.14	his hands 
SNG.5.14	his belly 
SNG.5.15	his legs 
SNG.5.15	his countenance 
SNG.5.16	his mouth 
SNG.5.16	yea, he 
SNG.5.16	This 
SNG.5.16	O daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	Whither is thy beloved gone,
SNG.6.1	O thou fairest among women?
SNG.6.1	Whither is thy beloved turned aside?
SNG.6.1	that we may seek him with thee.
SNG.6.2	My beloved is gone down into his garden,
SNG.6.2	to the beds of spices,
SNG.6.2	to feed in the gardens,
SNG.6.2	and to gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I 
SNG.6.3	and my beloved 
SNG.6.3	he feedeth among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	Thou 
SNG.6.4	comely as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	terrible as 
SNG.6.5	Turn away thine eyes from me,
SNG.6.5	for they have overcome me:
SNG.6.5	thy hair 
SNG.6.5	that appear from Gil´e-ad:
SNG.6.6	thy teeth 
SNG.6.6	which go up from the washing,
SNG.6.6	whereof every one beareth twins,
SNG.6.6	and 
SNG.6.7	As a piece of a pomegranate
SNG.6.8	There are threescore queens,
SNG.6.8	and fourscore concubines,
SNG.6.8	and virgins without number.
SNG.6.9	My dove, my undefiled is 
SNG.6.9	she 
SNG.6.9	she 
SNG.6.9	The daughters saw her, and blessed her;
SNG.6.9	and they praised her.
SNG.6.10	Who 
SNG.6.10	fair as the moon, clear as the sun,
SNG.6.11	I went down into the garden of nuts
SNG.6.11	to see the fruits of the valley,
SNG.6.12	Or ever I was aware,
SNG.6.12	my soul made me 
SNG.6.13	Return, return, O Shu´lamite;
SNG.6.13	return, return, that we may look upon thee.
SNG.6.13	What will ye see in the Shu´lamite?
SNG.6.13	As it were the company of two armies.
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter!
SNG.7.1	The joints of thy thighs 
SNG.7.1	the work of the hands of a cunning workman.
SNG.7.2	Thy navel 
SNG.7.2	thy belly 
SNG.7.3	Thy two breasts 
SNG.7.4	Thy neck 
SNG.7.4	thine eyes 
SNG.7.4	by the gate of Bath–rab´bim:
SNG.7.4	thy nose 
SNG.7.4	which looketh toward Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Thine head upon thee 
SNG.7.5	and the hair of thine head like purple;
SNG.7.5	the King 
SNG.7.6	How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
SNG.7.7	This thy stature is like to a palm tree,
SNG.7.7	and thy breasts to clusters 
SNG.7.8	I said, I will go up to the palm tree,
SNG.7.8	I will take hold of the boughs thereof:
SNG.7.8	now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine,
SNG.7.8	and the smell of thy nose like apples;
SNG.7.9	and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved,
SNG.7.9	that goeth 
SNG.7.9	causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
SNG.7.10	I 
SNG.7.10	and his desire 
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved,
SNG.7.11	let us go forth into the field;
SNG.7.11	let us lodge in the villages.
SNG.7.12	Let us get up early to the vineyards;
SNG.7.12	let us see if the vine flourish,
SNG.7.12	there will I give thee my loves.
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes give a smell,
SNG.7.13	and at our gates 
SNG.8.1	O that thou 
SNG.8.1	that sucked the breasts of my mother!
SNG.8.1	yea, I should not be despised.
SNG.8.2	I would lead thee, 
SNG.8.2	I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine
SNG.8.2	of the juice of my pomegranate.
SNG.8.3	His left hand 
SNG.8.3	and his right hand should embrace me.
SNG.8.4	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	that ye stir not up, nor awake 
SNG.8.4	until he please.
SNG.8.5	Who 
SNG.8.5	leaning upon her beloved?
SNG.8.5	I raised thee up under the apple tree:
SNG.8.5	there thy mother brought thee forth;
SNG.8.5	there she brought thee forth 
SNG.8.6	Set me as a seal upon thine heart,
SNG.8.6	as a seal upon thine arm:
SNG.8.6	for love 
SNG.8.6	jealousy 
SNG.8.6	the coals thereof 
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love,
SNG.8.7	neither can the floods drown it:
SNG.8.7	if a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
SNG.8.7	it would utterly be contemned.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister,
SNG.8.8	and she hath no breasts:
SNG.8.8	what shall we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	in the day when she shall be spoken for?
SNG.8.9	If she 
SNG.8.9	and if she 
SNG.8.10	I 
SNG.8.10	then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Ba´al–ha´mon;
SNG.8.11	he let out the vineyard unto keepers;
SNG.8.11	every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand 
SNG.8.12	My vineyard, which 
SNG.8.12	thou, O Solomon, 
SNG.8.12	and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
SNG.8.13	Thou that dwellest in the gardens,
SNG.8.13	the companions hearken to thy voice:
SNG.8.13	cause me to hear 
SNG.8.14	Make haste, my beloved,
SNG.8.14	and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart
SNG.8.14	upon the mountains of spices.
ISA.1.2	Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the 
ISA.1.3	The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: 
ISA.1.4	Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the 
ISA.1.5	Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. 
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot even unto the head 
ISA.1.7	Your country 
ISA.1.8	And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. 
ISA.1.9	 Except the 
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of the 
ISA.1.11	 To what purpose 
ISA.1.12	When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? 
ISA.1.13	Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; 
ISA.1.14	Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear 
ISA.1.15	And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. 
ISA.1.16	Wash ye, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; 
ISA.1.17	learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
ISA.1.18	Come now, and let us reason together, saith the 
ISA.1.19	If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: 
ISA.1.20	but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the 
ISA.1.21	How is the faithful city become a harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers. 
ISA.1.22	Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: 
ISA.1.23	thy princes 
ISA.1.24	Therefore saith the Lord, the 
ISA.1.25	And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin: 
ISA.1.26	and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
ISA.1.27	Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness. 
ISA.1.28	And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners 
ISA.1.29	For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. 
ISA.1.30	For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. 
ISA.1.31	And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench 
ISA.2.1	The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
ISA.2.2	And it shall come to pass in the last days, 
ISA.2.3	And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.4	 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
ISA.2.5	O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the 
ISA.2.6	Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and 
ISA.2.7	Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither 
ISA.2.8	their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made: 
ISA.2.9	and the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not. 
ISA.2.10	 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the 
ISA.2.11	The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down; and the 
ISA.2.12	For the day of the 
ISA.2.13	and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, 
ISA.2.14	and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills 
ISA.2.15	and upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, 
ISA.2.16	and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. 
ISA.2.17	And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low; and the 
ISA.2.18	And the idols he shall utterly abolish. 
ISA.2.19	And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the 
ISA.2.20	In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made 
ISA.2.21	to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the 
ISA.2.22	Cease ye from man, whose breath 
ISA.3.1	For, behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.3.2	the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, 
ISA.3.3	the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. 
ISA.3.4	And I will give children 
ISA.3.5	And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honorable.
ISA.3.6	When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, 
ISA.3.7	in that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house 
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings 
ISA.3.9	The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide

ISA.3.12	 my people, children 
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.15	What mean ye 
ISA.3.16	Moreover the 
ISA.3.17	therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the 
ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of 
ISA.3.19	the chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, 
ISA.3.20	the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, 
ISA.3.21	the rings, and nose jewels, 
ISA.3.22	the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, 
ISA.3.23	the glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils. 
ISA.3.24	And it shall come to pass, 
ISA.3.25	Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. 
ISA.3.26	And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she 
ISA.4.1	And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.
ISA.4.2	In that day shall the branch of the 
ISA.4.3	And it shall come to pass, 
ISA.4.4	when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. 
ISA.4.5	And the 
ISA.4.6	And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
ISA.5.1	a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.
ISA.5.1	My well-beloved hath a vineyard
ISA.5.1	in a very fruitful hill:
ISA.5.2	and he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof,
ISA.5.2	and planted it with the choicest vine,
ISA.5.2	and built a tower in the midst of it,
ISA.5.2	and also made a winepress therein:
ISA.5.2	and he looked that it should bring forth grapes,
ISA.5.2	and it brought forth wild grapes.
ISA.5.3	And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah,
ISA.5.3	judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What could have been done more to my vineyard,
ISA.5.4	that I have not done in it?
ISA.5.4	Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes,
ISA.5.4	brought it forth wild grapes?
ISA.5.5	And now go to;
ISA.5.5	I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard:
ISA.5.5	I will take away the hedge thereof,
ISA.5.5	and it shall be eaten up;
ISA.5.5	and it shall be trodden down:
ISA.5.6	and I will lay it waste:
ISA.5.6	it shall not be pruned, nor digged;
ISA.5.6	but there shall come up briers and thorns:
ISA.5.6	I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.7	and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:
ISA.5.7	and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression;
ISA.5.7	for righteousness, but behold a cry.
ISA.5.8	Woe unto them that join house to house, 
ISA.5.9	In mine ears 
ISA.5.10	Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.
ISA.5.11	Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, 
ISA.5.12	And the harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the 
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because 
ISA.5.14	Therefore hell
ISA.5.15	And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled: 
ISA.5.16	but the 
ISA.5.17	Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
ISA.5.18	Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope: 
ISA.5.19	that say, Let him make speed, 
ISA.5.20	Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! 
ISA.5.21	Woe unto 
ISA.5.22	Woe unto 
ISA.5.23	which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
ISA.5.24	Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, 
ISA.5.25	Therefore is the anger of the 
ISA.5.26	And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly: 
ISA.5.27	none shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: 
ISA.5.28	whose arrows 
ISA.5.29	their roaring 
ISA.5.30	And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if 
ISA.6.2	Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. 
ISA.6.3	 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, 
ISA.6.4	 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. 
ISA.6.5	Then said I, Woe 
ISA.6.6	Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, 
ISA.6.7	and he laid 
ISA.6.8	Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here 
ISA.6.9	 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. 
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. 
ISA.6.11	Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, 
ISA.6.12	and the 
ISA.6.13	But yet in it 
ISA.7.2	And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with E´phra-im. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
ISA.7.3	Then said the 
ISA.7.4	and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remali´ah. 
ISA.7.5	Because Syria, E´phra-im, and the son of Remali´ah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying, 
ISA.7.6	Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, 
ISA.7.7	thus saith the Lord 
ISA.7.8	For the head of Syria 
ISA.7.9	And the head of E´phra-im 
ISA.7.10	Moreover the 
ISA.7.11	Ask thee a sign of the 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the 
ISA.7.13	And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; 
ISA.7.14	 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Imman´u-el. 
ISA.7.15	Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. 
ISA.7.16	For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings. 
ISA.7.17	The 
ISA.7.18	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.7.19	And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
ISA.7.20	In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, 
ISA.7.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.7.22	and it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk 
ISA.7.23	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.7.24	With arrows and with bows shall 
ISA.7.25	And 
ISA.8.1	Moreover the 
ISA.8.2	And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uri´ah the priest, and Zechari´ah the son of Jeberechi´ah. 
ISA.8.3	And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the 
ISA.8.4	For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shilo´ah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remali´ah's son; 
ISA.8.7	now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, 
ISA.8.8	and he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach 
ISA.8.9	Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. 
ISA.8.10	Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God 
ISA.8.11	For the 
ISA.8.12	 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all 
ISA.8.13	Sanctify the 
ISA.8.14	 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
ISA.8.15	And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony, seal the law
ISA.8.17	 And I will wait upon the 
ISA.8.18	 Behold, I and the children whom the 
ISA.8.19	And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? 
ISA.8.20	To the law
ISA.8.21	And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward. 
ISA.8.22	And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and 
ISA.9.2	 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. 
ISA.9.3	Thou hast multiplied the nation, 
ISA.9.4	For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Mid´i-an. 
ISA.9.5	For every battle of the warrior 
ISA.9.6	For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor,
ISA.9.7	 Of the increase of 
ISA.9.8	The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. 
ISA.9.9	And all the people shall know, 
ISA.9.10	The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycamores are cut down, but we will change 
ISA.9.11	Therefore the 
ISA.9.12	the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand 
ISA.9.13	For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the 
ISA.9.14	Therefore the 
ISA.9.15	The ancient and honorable, he 
ISA.9.16	For the leaders of this people cause 
ISA.9.17	Therefore the 
ISA.9.18	For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up 
ISA.9.19	Through the wrath of the 
ISA.9.20	And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm: 
ISA.9.21	Manas´seh, E´phra-im; and E´phra-im, Manas´seh: 
ISA.10.1	Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness 
ISA.10.2	to turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and 
ISA.10.3	And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation 
ISA.10.4	Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand 
ISA.10.6	I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. 
ISA.10.7	Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but 
ISA.10.8	For he saith, 
ISA.10.9	 not Calno as Car´chemish? 
ISA.10.10	As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; 
ISA.10.11	shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
ISA.10.12	Wherefore it shall come to pass, 
ISA.10.13	For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done 
ISA.10.14	and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs 
ISA.10.15	Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? 
ISA.10.16	Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire. 
ISA.10.17	And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day; 
ISA.10.18	and shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth. 
ISA.10.19	And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
ISA.10.20	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.10.21	The remnant shall return, 
ISA.10.22	 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, 
ISA.10.23	For the Lord 
ISA.10.24	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
ISA.10.25	For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction. 
ISA.10.26	And the 
ISA.10.27	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.10.28	He is come to Ai´ath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages: 
ISA.10.29	they are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gib´e-ah of Saul is fled. 
ISA.10.30	Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto La´ish, O poor An´athoth. 
ISA.10.31	Madme´nah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee. 
ISA.10.32	As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand 
ISA.10.33	Behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.10.34	And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
ISA.11.2	and the Spirit of the 
ISA.11.3	and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the 
ISA.11.3	And he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: 
ISA.11.4	 but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. 
ISA.11.5	 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
ISA.11.7	And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 
ISA.11.8	And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den. 
ISA.11.9	 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the 
ISA.11.11	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.11.12	And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. 
ISA.11.13	The envy also of E´phra-im shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: E´phra-im shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex E´phra-im. 
ISA.11.14	But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. 
ISA.11.15	 And the 
ISA.11.16	And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	And in that day thou shalt say, O 
ISA.12.3	Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. 
ISA.12.4	And in that day shall ye say, Praise the 
ISA.12.5	Sing unto the 
ISA.12.6	Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great 
ISA.13.2	Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. 
ISA.13.3	I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, 
ISA.13.4	The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the 
ISA.13.5	They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, 
ISA.13.7	Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt: 
ISA.13.8	and they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces 
ISA.13.9	Behold, the day of the 
ISA.13.10	 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. 
ISA.13.11	And I will punish the world for 
ISA.13.12	I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. 
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the 
ISA.13.14	And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land. 
ISA.13.15	Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined 
ISA.13.16	Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.
ISA.13.17	Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and 
ISA.13.18	 bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children. 
ISA.13.19	 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomor´rah. 
ISA.13.20	It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. 
ISA.13.21	 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. 
ISA.13.22	And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in 
ISA.14.1	For the 
ISA.14.2	And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the 
ISA.14.3	And it shall come to pass in the day that the 
ISA.14.4	that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased! 
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.6	He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, 
ISA.14.7	The whole earth is at rest, 
ISA.14.8	Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, 
ISA.14.9	Hell
ISA.14.10	All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us? 
ISA.14.11	Thy pomp is brought down to the grave,
ISA.14.13	 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High. 
ISA.14.15	Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell,
ISA.14.16	They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, 
ISA.14.17	 made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; 
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations, 
ISA.14.19	But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, 
ISA.14.20	Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, 
ISA.14.21	Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities. 
ISA.14.22	For I will rise up against them, saith the 
ISA.14.23	I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the 
ISA.14.25	that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders. 
ISA.14.26	This 
ISA.14.27	For the 
ISA.14.30	And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant. 
ISA.14.31	Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palesti´na, 
ISA.14.32	What shall 
ISA.15.1	Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, 
ISA.15.2	he is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Me´deba: on all their heads 
ISA.15.3	In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly. 
ISA.15.4	And Heshbon shall cry, and Ele-a´leh; their voice shall be heard 
ISA.15.5	My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives 
ISA.15.6	For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing. 
ISA.15.7	Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows. 
ISA.15.8	For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eg´la-im, and the howling thereof unto Beer–e´lim. 
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.
ISA.16.1	Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion. 
ISA.16.2	For it shall be, 
ISA.16.3	Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth. 
ISA.16.4	Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land. 
ISA.16.5	And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Moab; 
ISA.16.7	Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir–har´eseth shall ye mourn; surely 
ISA.16.8	For the fields of Heshbon languish, 
ISA.16.9	Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Ele-a´leh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen. 
ISA.16.10	And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in 
ISA.16.11	Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir–he´res. 
ISA.16.12	And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.
ISA.16.13	This 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	Behold, Damascus is taken away from 
ISA.17.2	The cities of Aro´er 
ISA.17.3	The fortress also shall cease from E´phra-im, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the 
ISA.17.4	And in that day it shall come to pass, 
ISA.17.5	And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Reph´a-im. 
ISA.17.6	Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two 
ISA.17.7	At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel. 
ISA.17.8	And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect 
ISA.17.9	In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation. 
ISA.17.10	Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the Rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips: 
ISA.17.11	in the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: 
ISA.17.12	Woe to the multitude of many people, 
ISA.17.13	The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but 
ISA.17.14	And behold at eveningtide trouble; 
ISA.18.2	that sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, 
ISA.18.3	All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.
ISA.18.4	For so the 
ISA.18.5	For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away 
ISA.18.6	They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
ISA.18.7	In that time shall the present be brought unto the 
ISA.19.1	Behold, the 
ISA.19.2	And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor; city against city, 
ISA.19.3	And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards. 
ISA.19.4	And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the 
ISA.19.5	And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up. 
ISA.19.6	And they shall turn the rivers far away; 
ISA.19.7	The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no 
ISA.19.8	The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish. 
ISA.19.9	Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded. 
ISA.19.10	And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices 
ISA.19.11	Surely the princes of Zo´an 
ISA.19.12	Where 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zo´an are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, 
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.15	Neither shall there be 
ISA.19.16	In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the 
ISA.19.17	And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the 
ISA.19.18	In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the 
ISA.19.19	In that day shall there be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the 
ISA.19.21	And the 
ISA.19.22	And the 
ISA.19.23	In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.
ISA.19.24	In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, 
ISA.19.25	whom the 
ISA.20.1	In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it; 
ISA.20.2	at the same time spake the 
ISA.20.3	And the 
ISA.20.4	so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with 
ISA.20.5	And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory. 
ISA.20.6	And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such 
ISA.21.1	The burden of the desert of the sea.
ISA.21.1	As whirlwinds in the south pass through; 
ISA.21.2	A grievous vision is declared unto me; The treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Me´di-a: all the sighing thereof have I made to cease. 
ISA.21.3	Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing 
ISA.21.4	My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me. 
ISA.21.5	Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, 
ISA.21.6	For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth. 
ISA.21.7	And he saw a chariot 
ISA.21.8	and he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: 
ISA.21.9	 and, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, 
ISA.21.10	O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the 
ISA.21.11	The burden of Dumah.
ISA.21.11	He calleth to me out of Se´ir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? 
ISA.21.12	The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come.
ISA.21.13	The burden upon Arabia.
ISA.21.13	In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye traveling companies of De´danim. 
ISA.21.14	The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.
ISA.21.15	For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. 
ISA.21.16	For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail: 
ISA.21.17	and the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the 
ISA.22.1	The burden of the valley of vision.
ISA.22.1	What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops? 
ISA.22.2	Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain 
ISA.22.3	All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, 
ISA.22.4	Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labor not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.
ISA.22.5	For 
ISA.22.6	And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men 
ISA.22.7	And it shall come to pass, 
ISA.22.8	And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the armor of the house of the forest. 
ISA.22.9	Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool. 
ISA.22.10	And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall. 
ISA.22.11	Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.
ISA.22.12	And in that day did the Lord 
ISA.22.13	 and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we shall die. 
ISA.22.14	And it was revealed in mine ears by the 
ISA.22.15	Thus saith the Lord 
ISA.22.16	What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, 
ISA.22.17	Behold, the 
ISA.22.18	He will surely violently turn and toss thee 
ISA.22.19	And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down. 
ISA.22.20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eli´akim the son of Hilki´ah: 
ISA.22.21	and I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. 
ISA.22.22	 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. 
ISA.22.23	And I will fasten him 
ISA.22.24	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons. 
ISA.22.25	In that day, saith the 
ISA.23.1	Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them. 
ISA.23.2	Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished. 
ISA.23.3	And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, 
ISA.23.4	Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, 
ISA.23.5	As at the report concerning Egypt, 
ISA.23.6	Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. 
ISA.23.7	 this your joyous 
ISA.23.8	Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning 
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.10	Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: 
ISA.23.11	He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the 
ISA.23.12	And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.
ISA.23.13	Behold the land of the Chalde´ans; this people was not, 
ISA.23.14	Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste. 
ISA.23.15	And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as a harlot.
ISA.23.16	Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered. 
ISA.23.17	And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the 
ISA.23.18	And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the 
ISA.24.1	Behold, the 
ISA.24.2	And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him. 
ISA.24.3	The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the 
ISA.24.4	The earth mourneth 
ISA.24.5	The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. 
ISA.24.6	Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. 
ISA.24.7	The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted do sigh. 
ISA.24.8	The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth. 
ISA.24.9	They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. 
ISA.24.10	The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in. 
ISA.24.11	 a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone. 
ISA.24.12	In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction. 
ISA.24.13	When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, 
ISA.24.14	They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the 
ISA.24.15	Wherefore glorify ye the 
ISA.24.16	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, 
ISA.24.17	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, 
ISA.24.18	And it shall come to pass, 
ISA.24.19	The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. 
ISA.24.20	The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.
ISA.24.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.24.22	And they shall be gathered together, 
ISA.24.23	Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the 
ISA.25.1	O 
ISA.25.2	For thou hast made of a city a heap; 
ISA.25.3	Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee. 
ISA.25.4	For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones 
ISA.25.5	Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; 
ISA.25.6	And in this mountain shall the 
ISA.25.7	And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations. 
ISA.25.8	 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord 
ISA.25.9	And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this 
ISA.25.11	And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth 
ISA.25.12	And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, 
ISA.26.1	In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah;
ISA.26.1	We have a strong city;
ISA.26.1	salvation will 
ISA.26.2	Open ye the gates,
ISA.26.2	that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.
ISA.26.3	Thou wilt keep 
ISA.26.3	because he trusteth in thee.
ISA.26.4	Trust ye in the 
ISA.26.4	for in the 
ISA.26.5	For he bringeth down them that dwell on high;
ISA.26.5	the lofty city, he layeth it low;
ISA.26.5	he layeth it low, 
ISA.26.5	he bringeth it 
ISA.26.6	The foot shall tread it down,
ISA.26.7	The way of the just 
ISA.26.7	thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.
ISA.26.8	Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O 
ISA.26.8	have we waited for thee;
ISA.26.8	the desire of 
ISA.26.8	and to the remembrance of thee.
ISA.26.9	With my soul have I desired thee in the night;
ISA.26.9	yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early:
ISA.26.9	for when thy judgments 
ISA.26.9	the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	Let favor be showed to the wicked,
ISA.26.10	in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly,
ISA.26.10	and will not behold the majesty of the 
ISA.26.11	they will not see:
ISA.26.11	for 
ISA.26.11	yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.
ISA.26.12	for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.
ISA.26.13	O 
ISA.26.14	therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them,
ISA.26.14	and made all their memory to perish.
ISA.26.15	Thou hast increased the nation, O 
ISA.26.15	thou hast increased the nation;
ISA.26.15	thou art glorified:
ISA.26.15	thou hadst removed 
ISA.26.16	they poured out a prayer
ISA.26.17	Like as a woman with child,
ISA.26.17	is in pain, 
ISA.26.17	so have we been in thy sight, O 
ISA.26.18	We have been with child, we have been in pain,
ISA.26.18	we have as it were brought forth wind;
ISA.26.18	we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth;
ISA.26.18	neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
ISA.26.19	Thy dead 
ISA.26.19	Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust:
ISA.26.19	for thy dew 
ISA.26.19	and the earth shall cast out the dead.
ISA.26.20	Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers,
ISA.26.20	and shut thy doors about thee:
ISA.26.20	hide thyself as it were for a little moment,
ISA.26.20	until the indignation be overpast.
ISA.26.21	For, behold, the 
ISA.26.21	to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity:
ISA.26.21	the earth also shall disclose her blood,
ISA.26.21	and shall no more cover her slain.
ISA.27.2	In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine. 
ISA.27.3	I the 
ISA.27.4	Fury 
ISA.27.5	Or let him take hold of my strength, 
ISA.27.6	He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit. 
ISA.27.7	Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? 
ISA.27.8	In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind. 
ISA.27.9	By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this 
ISA.27.10	Yet the defensed city 
ISA.27.11	When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, 
ISA.27.12	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.27.13	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.28.1	Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of E´phra-im, whose glorious beauty 
ISA.28.2	Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, 
ISA.28.3	The crown of pride, the drunkards of E´phra-im, shall be trodden under feet: 
ISA.28.4	and the glorious beauty, which 
ISA.28.5	In that day shall the 
ISA.28.6	and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
ISA.28.7	But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble 
ISA.28.8	For all tables are full of vomit 
ISA.28.9	Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? 
ISA.28.10	For precept 
ISA.28.12	To whom he said, This 
ISA.28.13	But the word of the 
ISA.28.14	Wherefore hear the word of the 
ISA.28.15	Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell
ISA.28.16	 therefore thus saith the Lord 
ISA.28.17	Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. 
ISA.28.18	And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell
ISA.28.19	From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only 
ISA.28.20	For the bed is shorter than that 
ISA.28.21	 For the 
ISA.28.22	Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord 
ISA.28.23	Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech. 
ISA.28.24	Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground? 
ISA.28.25	When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley
ISA.28.26	For his God doth instruct him to discretion, 
ISA.28.27	For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod. 
ISA.28.28	Bread 
ISA.28.29	This also cometh forth from the 
ISA.29.1	Woe to A´ri-el, to A´ri-el, the city 
ISA.29.2	Yet I will distress A´ri-el, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as A´ri-el. 
ISA.29.3	And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee. 
ISA.29.4	And thou shalt be brought down, 
ISA.29.5	Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones 
ISA.29.6	Thou shalt be visited of the 
ISA.29.7	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against A´ri-el, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision. 
ISA.29.8	It shall even be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, 
ISA.29.9	Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. 
ISA.29.10	 For the 
ISA.29.11	And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which 
ISA.29.12	and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.
ISA.29.14	 therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, 
ISA.29.15	Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the 
ISA.29.16	Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?
ISA.29.18	And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. 
ISA.29.19	The meek also shall increase 
ISA.29.20	For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: 
ISA.29.21	that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.
ISA.29.22	Therefore thus saith the 
ISA.29.23	But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. 
ISA.29.24	They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
ISA.30.1	Woe to the rebellious children, saith the 
ISA.30.2	that walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt! 
ISA.30.3	Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt 
ISA.30.4	For his princes were at Zo´an, and his ambassadors came to Ha´nes. 
ISA.30.5	They were all ashamed of a people 
ISA.30.6	The burden of the beasts of the south.
ISA.30.6	Into the land of trouble and anguish from whence 
ISA.30.7	For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength 
ISA.30.8	Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: 
ISA.30.9	that this 
ISA.30.10	which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: 
ISA.30.11	get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us. 
ISA.30.12	Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon: 
ISA.30.13	therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant. 
ISA.30.14	And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water 
ISA.30.15	For thus saith the Lord 
ISA.30.16	But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. 
ISA.30.17	One thousand 
ISA.30.18	And therefore will the 
ISA.30.19	For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee. 
ISA.30.20	And 
ISA.30.21	and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This 
ISA.30.22	Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.
ISA.30.23	Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures. 
ISA.30.24	The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. 
ISA.30.25	And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers 
ISA.30.26	Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the 
ISA.30.27	Behold, the name of the 
ISA.30.28	and his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and 
ISA.30.29	Ye shall have a song, as in the night 
ISA.30.30	And the 
ISA.30.31	For through the voice of the 
ISA.30.32	And 
ISA.30.33	For Tophet 
ISA.31.1	Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because 
ISA.31.2	Yet he also 
ISA.31.3	Now the Egyptians 
ISA.31.4	For thus hath the 
ISA.31.5	As birds flying, so will the 
ISA.31.6	Turn ye unto 
ISA.31.7	For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you 
ISA.31.8	Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited. 
ISA.31.9	And he shall pass over to his stronghold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the 
ISA.32.1	Behold, a King shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. 
ISA.32.2	And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. 
ISA.32.3	And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken. 
ISA.32.4	The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. 
ISA.32.5	The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said 
ISA.32.6	For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the 
ISA.32.7	The instruments also of the churl 
ISA.32.8	But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.
ISA.32.9	Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech. 
ISA.32.10	Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come. 
ISA.32.11	Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird 
ISA.32.12	They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. 
ISA.32.13	Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns 
ISA.32.14	because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks; 
ISA.32.15	until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.
ISA.32.16	Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field. 
ISA.32.17	And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever. 
ISA.32.18	And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places; 
ISA.32.19	when it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place. 
ISA.32.20	Blessed 
ISA.33.1	Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou 
ISA.33.2	O 
ISA.33.3	At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered. 
ISA.33.4	And your spoil shall be gathered 
ISA.33.5	The 
ISA.33.6	And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, 
ISA.33.7	Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. 
ISA.33.8	The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. 
ISA.33.9	The earth mourneth 
ISA.33.10	Now will I rise, saith the 
ISA.33.11	Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, 
ISA.33.12	And the people shall be 
ISA.33.13	Hear, ye 
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? 
ISA.33.15	He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; 
ISA.33.16	he shall dwell on high; his place of defense 
ISA.33.17	Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off. 
ISA.33.18	Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where 
ISA.33.19	Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, 
ISA.33.20	Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle 
ISA.33.21	But there the glorious 
ISA.33.22	For the 
ISA.33.23	Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast; they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey. 
ISA.33.24	And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein 
ISA.34.1	Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it. 
ISA.34.2	For the indignation of the 
ISA.34.3	Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcasses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood. 
ISA.34.4	 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling 
ISA.34.6	The sword of the 
ISA.34.7	And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
ISA.34.8	For 
ISA.34.9	And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. 
ISA.34.10	 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever. 
ISA.34.11	But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness. 
ISA.34.12	They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none 
ISA.34.13	And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be a habitation of dragons, 
ISA.34.14	The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest. 
ISA.34.15	There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate. 
ISA.34.16	Seek ye out of the book of the 
ISA.34.17	And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
ISA.35.1	The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. 
ISA.35.2	It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon; they shall see the glory of the 
ISA.35.4	Say to them 
ISA.35.6	Then shall the lame 
ISA.35.7	And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, 
ISA.35.8	And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it 
ISA.35.9	No lion shall be there, nor 
ISA.35.10	and the ransomed of the 
ISA.36.1	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezeki´ah, 
ISA.36.2	And the king of Assyria sent Rab–sha´keh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezeki´ah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field. 
ISA.36.3	Then came forth unto him Eli´akim, Hilki´ah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Jo´ah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
ISA.36.4	And Rab–sha´keh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezeki´ah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence 
ISA.36.5	I say, 
ISA.36.6	Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so 
ISA.36.7	But if thou say to me, We trust in the 
ISA.36.8	Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 
ISA.36.9	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
ISA.36.10	And am I now come up without the 
ISA.36.11	Then said Eli´akim and Shebna and Jo´ah unto Rab–sha´keh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand 
ISA.36.12	But Rab–sha´keh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? 
ISA.36.13	Then Rab–sha´keh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
ISA.36.14	Thus saith the king, Let not Hezeki´ah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you. 
ISA.36.15	Neither let Hezeki´ah make you trust in the 
ISA.36.16	Hearken not to Hezeki´ah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make 
ISA.36.17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
ISA.36.18	 lest Hezeki´ah persuade you, saying, The 
ISA.36.19	Where 
ISA.36.20	Who 
ISA.36.21	But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. 
ISA.36.22	Then came Eli´akim, the son of Hilki´ah, that 
ISA.37.1	And it came to pass, when king Hezeki´ah heard 
ISA.37.2	And he sent Eli´akim, who 
ISA.37.3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezeki´ah, This day 
ISA.37.4	It may be the 
ISA.37.5	So the servants of king Hezeki´ah came to Isaiah. 
ISA.37.6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the 
ISA.37.7	Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
ISA.37.8	So Rab–sha´keh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 
ISA.37.9	And he heard say concerning Tirha´kah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard 
ISA.37.10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezeki´ah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
ISA.37.11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? 
ISA.37.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, 
ISA.37.13	Where 
ISA.37.14	And Hezeki´ah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezeki´ah went up unto the house of the 
ISA.37.15	And Hezeki´ah prayed unto the 
ISA.37.16	 O 
ISA.37.17	Incline thine ear, O 
ISA.37.18	Of a truth, 
ISA.37.19	and have cast their gods into the fire: for they 
ISA.37.20	Now therefore, O 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezeki´ah, saying, Thus saith the 
ISA.37.22	this 
ISA.37.23	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted 
ISA.37.24	By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, 
ISA.37.25	I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
ISA.37.26	Hast thou not heard long ago, 
ISA.37.27	Therefore their inhabitants 
ISA.37.28	But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. 
ISA.37.29	Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
ISA.37.30	And this 
ISA.37.31	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward: 
ISA.37.32	for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the 
ISA.37.33	Therefore thus saith the 
ISA.37.34	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the 
ISA.37.35	For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
ISA.37.36	Then the angel of the 
ISA.37.37	So Sennach´erib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nin´eveh. 
ISA.37.38	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adram´melech and Share´zer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esar–had´don his son reigned in his stead.
ISA.38.1	In those days was Hezeki´ah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the 
ISA.38.2	Then Hezeki´ah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the 
ISA.38.3	and said, Remember now, O 
ISA.38.4	Then came the word of the 
ISA.38.5	Go, and say to Hezeki´ah, Thus saith the 
ISA.38.6	And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.
ISA.38.7	And this 
ISA.38.8	Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
ISA.38.9	The writing of Hezeki´ah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:
ISA.38.10	I said in the cutting off of my days,
ISA.38.10	I shall go to the gates of the grave:
ISA.38.10	I am deprived of the residue of my years.
ISA.38.11	I said, I shall not see the 
ISA.38.11	I shall behold man no more
ISA.38.11	with the inhabitants of the world.
ISA.38.12	Mine age is departed,
ISA.38.12	and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent:
ISA.38.12	I have cut off like a weaver my life:
ISA.38.12	he will cut me off with pining sickness:
ISA.38.12	from day 
ISA.38.13	I reckoned till morning, 
ISA.38.13	as a lion, so will he break all my bones:
ISA.38.13	from day 
ISA.38.14	Like a crane 
ISA.38.14	I did mourn as a dove:
ISA.38.14	mine eyes fail 
ISA.38.14	O 
ISA.38.15	What shall I say?
ISA.38.15	He hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done 
ISA.38.15	I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
ISA.38.16	O Lord, by these 
ISA.38.16	and in all these 
ISA.38.16	so wilt thou recover me,
ISA.38.16	and make me to live.
ISA.38.17	Behold, for peace I had great bitterness;
ISA.38.17	but thou hast in love to my soul
ISA.38.17	for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
ISA.38.18	For the grave cannot praise thee,
ISA.38.18	death cannot celebrate thee:
ISA.38.18	they that go down into the pit
ISA.38.18	cannot hope for thy truth.
ISA.38.19	The living, the living, he shall praise thee,
ISA.38.19	as I 
ISA.38.19	the father to the children
ISA.38.19	shall make known thy truth.
ISA.38.20	The 
ISA.38.20	therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments
ISA.38.20	all the days of our life in the house of the 
ISA.38.21	For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay 
ISA.38.22	Hezeki´ah also had said, What 
ISA.39.1	At that time Mer´odach–bal´adan, the son of Bal´adan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezeki´ah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered. 
ISA.39.2	And Hezeki´ah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezeki´ah showed them not. 
ISA.39.3	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezeki´ah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezeki´ah said, They are come from a far country unto me, 
ISA.39.4	Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezeki´ah answered, All that 
ISA.39.5	Then said Isaiah to Hezeki´ah, Hear the word of the 
ISA.39.6	Behold, the days come, that all that 
ISA.39.7	 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. 
ISA.39.8	Then said Hezeki´ah to Isaiah, Good 
ISA.40.1	Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 
ISA.40.2	Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the 
ISA.40.4	Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: 
ISA.40.5	and the glory of the 
ISA.40.7	the grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the spirit of the 
ISA.40.8	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
ISA.40.9	O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings,
ISA.40.10	 Behold, the Lord 
ISA.40.11	He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry 
ISA.40.12	Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? 
ISA.40.13	 Who hath directed the Spirit of the 
ISA.40.14	With whom took he counsel, and 
ISA.40.15	Behold, the nations 
ISA.40.16	And Lebanon 
ISA.40.17	All nations before him 
ISA.40.18	To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? 
ISA.40.19	The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains. 
ISA.40.20	He that 
ISA.40.21	Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? 
ISA.40.22	 he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof 
ISA.40.23	that bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. 
ISA.40.24	Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown; yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
ISA.40.25	To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. 
ISA.40.26	Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these 
ISA.40.27	Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the 
ISA.40.28	Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, 
ISA.40.29	He giveth power to the faint; and to 
ISA.40.30	Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: 
ISA.40.31	but they that wait upon the 
ISA.41.1	Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew 
ISA.41.2	Who raised up the righteous 
ISA.41.3	He pursued them, 
ISA.41.4	Who hath wrought and done 
ISA.41.5	The isles saw 
ISA.41.6	They helped every one his neighbor; and 
ISA.41.7	So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, 
ISA.41.9	 whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou 
ISA.41.10	Fear thou not; for I 
ISA.41.11	Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish. 
ISA.41.12	Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, 
ISA.41.13	For I the 
ISA.41.14	Fear not, thou worm Jacob, 
ISA.41.15	Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat 
ISA.41.16	Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the 
ISA.41.18	I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. 
ISA.41.19	I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, 
ISA.41.20	that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the 
ISA.41.21	Produce your cause, saith the 
ISA.41.22	Let them bring 
ISA.41.23	Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye 
ISA.41.24	Behold, ye 
ISA.41.25	I have raised up 
ISA.41.26	Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, 
ISA.41.27	The first 
ISA.41.28	For I beheld, and 
ISA.41.29	Behold, they 
ISA.42.2	He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. 
ISA.42.3	A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. 
ISA.42.4	He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.
ISA.42.6	 I the 
ISA.42.7	to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, 
ISA.42.8	I 
ISA.42.9	Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.
ISA.42.10	Sing unto the 
ISA.42.11	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up 
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory unto the 
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.14	I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, 
ISA.42.15	I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. 
ISA.42.16	And I will bring the blind by a way 
ISA.42.17	They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye 
ISA.42.18	Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. 
ISA.42.19	Who 
ISA.42.20	Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not. 
ISA.42.21	The 
ISA.42.22	But this 
ISA.42.23	Who among you will give ear to this? 
ISA.42.24	Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the 
ISA.42.25	Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid 
ISA.43.1	But now thus saith the 
ISA.43.2	When thou passest through the waters, I 
ISA.43.3	For I 
ISA.43.4	Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honorable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life. 
ISA.43.5	Fear not; for I 
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; 
ISA.43.7	 every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.
ISA.43.8	Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. 
ISA.43.9	Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, 
ISA.43.10	Ye 
ISA.43.11	I, 
ISA.43.12	I have declared, and have saved, and I have showed, when 
ISA.43.13	Yea, before the day 
ISA.43.14	Thus saith the 
ISA.43.15	I 
ISA.43.16	Thus saith the 
ISA.43.17	which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow. 
ISA.43.18	Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. 
ISA.43.19	Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, 
ISA.43.20	The beast of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, 
ISA.43.21	This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.
ISA.43.22	But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel. 
ISA.43.23	Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. 
ISA.43.24	Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
ISA.43.25	I, 
ISA.43.26	Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified. 
ISA.43.27	Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me. 
ISA.43.28	Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
ISA.44.1	Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen: 
ISA.44.2	thus saith the 
ISA.44.3	For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring: 
ISA.44.4	and they shall spring up 
ISA.44.5	One shall say, I 
ISA.44.7	And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them show unto them. 
ISA.44.8	Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared 
ISA.44.9	They that make a graven image 
ISA.44.10	Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image 
ISA.44.11	Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed; and the workmen, they 
ISA.44.12	The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint. 
ISA.44.13	The carpenter stretcheth out 
ISA.44.14	He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish 
ISA.44.15	Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth 
ISA.44.16	He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth 
ISA.44.17	and the residue thereof he maketh a god, 
ISA.44.18	They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; 
ISA.44.19	And none considereth in his heart, neither 
ISA.44.20	He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, 
ISA.44.21	Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou 
ISA.44.22	I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. 
ISA.44.23	Sing, O ye heavens; for the 
ISA.44.24	Thus saith the 
ISA.44.25	 that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise 
ISA.44.26	that confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof: 
ISA.44.27	that saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: 
ISA.44.28	 that saith of Cyrus, 
ISA.45.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.2	I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: 
ISA.45.3	and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the 
ISA.45.4	For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me. 
ISA.45.5	I 
ISA.45.6	that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that 
ISA.45.7	I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the 
ISA.45.8	Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the 
ISA.45.10	Woe unto him that saith unto 
ISA.45.11	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.12	I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, 
ISA.45.13	I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the 
ISA.45.14	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.15	Verily thou 
ISA.45.16	They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together 
ISA.45.17	 Israel shall be saved in the 
ISA.45.18	For thus saith the 
ISA.45.19	I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the 
ISA.45.20	Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye 
ISA.45.21	Tell ye, and bring 
ISA.45.22	Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I 
ISA.45.23	 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth 
ISA.45.24	Surely shall 
ISA.45.25	In the 
ISA.46.1	Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages 
ISA.46.2	They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
ISA.46.3	Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne 
ISA.46.4	and 
ISA.46.5	To whom will ye liken me, and make 
ISA.46.6	They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, 
ISA.46.7	They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, 
ISA.46.8	Remember this, and show yourselves men: bring 
ISA.46.9	Remember the former things of old: for I 
ISA.46.10	declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times 
ISA.46.11	calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken 
ISA.46.12	Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted, that 
ISA.46.13	I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
ISA.47.2	Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers. 
ISA.47.3	Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet 
ISA.47.4	 our Redeemer, the 
ISA.47.5	Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chalde´ans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms. 
ISA.47.6	I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst show them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. 
ISA.47.7	And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: 
ISA.47.9	but these two 
ISA.47.10	For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I 
ISA.47.11	Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, 
ISA.47.12	Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. 
ISA.47.13	Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from 
ISA.47.14	Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: 
ISA.47.15	Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast labored, 
ISA.48.1	Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the 
ISA.48.2	For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel: The 
ISA.48.3	I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I did 
ISA.48.4	Because I knew that thou 
ISA.48.5	I have even from the beginning declared 
ISA.48.6	Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare 
ISA.48.7	They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. 
ISA.48.8	Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time 
ISA.48.9	For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. 
ISA.48.10	Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. 
ISA.48.11	For mine own sake, 
ISA.48.13	Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: 
ISA.48.14	All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these 
ISA.48.15	I, 
ISA.48.16	Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there 
ISA.48.17	Thus saith the 
ISA.48.18	O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: 
ISA.48.19	thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.
ISA.48.21	And they thirsted not 
ISA.49.1	Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The 
ISA.49.2	And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me; 
ISA.49.3	and said unto me, Thou 
ISA.49.4	Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: 
ISA.49.5	And now, saith the 
ISA.49.6	 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth. 
ISA.49.7	Thus saith the 
ISA.49.9	that thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that 
ISA.49.10	 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them. 
ISA.49.11	And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted. 
ISA.49.12	Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim. 
ISA.49.13	Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the 
ISA.49.14	But Zion said, The 
ISA.49.15	Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. 
ISA.49.16	Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of 
ISA.49.17	Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee. 
ISA.49.18	Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, 
ISA.49.19	For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away. 
ISA.49.20	The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place 
ISA.49.21	Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where 
ISA.49.22	Thus saith the Lord 
ISA.49.23	And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with 
ISA.49.24	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? 
ISA.49.25	But thus saith the 
ISA.49.26	And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the 
ISA.50.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.50.2	Wherefore, when I came, 
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
ISA.50.4	The Lord 
ISA.50.5	The Lord 
ISA.50.6	 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
ISA.50.7	For the Lord 
ISA.50.8	 near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who 
ISA.50.9	Behold, the Lord 
ISA.50.10	Who 
ISA.50.11	Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass 
ISA.51.1	Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the 
ISA.51.2	Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah 
ISA.51.3	For the 
ISA.51.4	Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people. 
ISA.51.5	My righteousness 
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
ISA.51.7	Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart 
ISA.51.8	For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the 
ISA.51.10	 thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? 
ISA.51.11	Therefore the redeemed of the 
ISA.51.12	I, 
ISA.51.13	and forgettest the 
ISA.51.14	The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
ISA.51.15	But I 
ISA.51.16	And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou 
ISA.51.18	 none to guide her among all the sons 
ISA.51.19	These two 
ISA.51.20	Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the 
ISA.51.21	Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine: 
ISA.51.22	thus saith thy Lord the 
ISA.51.23	but I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.
ISA.52.2	Shake thyself from the dust; arise, 
ISA.52.3	For thus saith the 
ISA.52.4	For thus saith the Lord 
ISA.52.5	 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the 
ISA.52.6	Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore 
ISA.52.8	Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the 
ISA.52.9	Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the 
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.12	For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the 
ISA.52.13	Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. 
ISA.52.14	As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: 
ISA.52.15	 so shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for 
ISA.53.2	For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, 
ISA.53.3	He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were 
ISA.53.5	 But he 
ISA.53.6	 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the 
ISA.53.8	He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. 
ISA.53.9	 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither 
ISA.53.10	Yet it pleased the 
ISA.53.11	He shall see of the travail of his soul, 
ISA.53.12	 Therefore will I divide him 
ISA.54.2	Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; 
ISA.54.3	for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
ISA.54.4	Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. 
ISA.54.5	For thy Maker 
ISA.54.6	For the 
ISA.54.7	For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. 
ISA.54.8	In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the 
ISA.54.10	For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the 
ISA.54.12	And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. 
ISA.54.13	 And all thy children 
ISA.54.14	In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee. 
ISA.54.15	Behold, they shall surely gather together, 
ISA.54.16	Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. 
ISA.54.17	No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue 
ISA.55.2	Wherefore do ye spend money for 
ISA.55.3	 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, 
ISA.55.4	Behold, I have given him 
ISA.55.5	Behold, thou shalt call a nation 
ISA.55.6	Seek ye the 
ISA.55.7	let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the 
ISA.55.8	For my thoughts 
ISA.55.9	For 
ISA.55.11	so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper 
ISA.55.12	For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap 
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the 
ISA.56.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.56.2	Blessed 
ISA.56.3	Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the 
ISA.56.4	For thus saith the 
ISA.56.5	Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
ISA.56.6	Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the 
ISA.56.7	 even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices 
ISA.56.8	The Lord 
ISA.56.9	All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, 
ISA.56.10	His watchmen 
ISA.56.11	Yea, 
ISA.56.12	Come ye, 
ISA.57.1	The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth 
ISA.57.2	He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, 
ISA.57.3	But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore. 
ISA.57.4	Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, 
ISA.57.5	inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks? 
ISA.57.6	Among the smooth 
ISA.57.7	Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice. 
ISA.57.8	Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered 
ISA.57.9	And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase 
ISA.57.10	Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; 
ISA.57.11	And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid 
ISA.57.12	I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee. 
ISA.57.13	When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take 
ISA.57.14	And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people. 
ISA.57.15	For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name 
ISA.57.16	For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls 
ISA.57.17	For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. 
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners. 
ISA.57.19	 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to 
ISA.57.20	But the wicked 
ISA.58.1	Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. 
ISA.58.2	Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God. 
ISA.58.3	Wherefore have we fasted, 
ISA.58.4	Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as 
ISA.58.5	Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? 
ISA.58.7	 not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? 
ISA.58.8	Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the 
ISA.58.9	Then shalt thou call, and the 
ISA.58.9	If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; 
ISA.58.10	and 
ISA.58.11	and the 
ISA.58.12	And 
ISA.58.13	If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, 
ISA.58.14	then shalt thou delight thyself in the 
ISA.59.1	Behold, the 
ISA.59.2	but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid 
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. 
ISA.59.4	None calleth for justice, nor 
ISA.59.5	They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. 
ISA.59.6	Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works 
ISA.59.7	 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts 
ISA.59.8	The way of peace they know not; and 
ISA.59.9	Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, 
ISA.59.10	We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if 
ISA.59.11	We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but 
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions 
ISA.59.13	in transgressing and lying against the 
ISA.59.14	And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. 
ISA.59.15	Yea, truth faileth; and he 
ISA.59.15	And the 
ISA.59.16	 And he saw that 
ISA.59.17	 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance 
ISA.59.18	According to 
ISA.59.19	So shall they fear the name of the 
ISA.59.21	As for me, this 
ISA.60.1	Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the 
ISA.60.2	For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the 
ISA.60.3	And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
ISA.60.4	Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at 
ISA.60.5	Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. 
ISA.60.6	The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Mid´i-an and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the 
ISA.60.7	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebai´oth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory. 
ISA.60.8	Who 
ISA.60.9	Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the 
ISA.60.10	And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee. 
ISA.60.11	 Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that 
ISA.60.12	For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, 
ISA.60.13	The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious. 
ISA.60.14	 The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the 
ISA.60.15	Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through 
ISA.60.16	Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the 
ISA.60.17	For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. 
ISA.60.18	Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.
ISA.60.20	Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the 
ISA.60.21	Thy people also 
ISA.60.22	A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the 
ISA.61.2	 to proclaim the acceptable year of the 
ISA.61.3	to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called Trees of righteousness, The planting of the 
ISA.61.4	And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
ISA.61.5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien 
ISA.61.6	But ye shall be named The priests of the 
ISA.61.7	For your shame 
ISA.61.8	For I the 
ISA.61.9	And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they 
ISA.61.11	For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord 
ISA.62.1	For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp 
ISA.62.2	And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the 
ISA.62.3	Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the 
ISA.62.4	Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Heph´zibah,
ISA.62.5	For 
ISA.62.6	I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, 
ISA.62.7	and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.9	but they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the 
ISA.62.10	Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people. 
ISA.62.11	 Behold, the 
ISA.62.12	And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the 
ISA.63.2	Wherefore 
ISA.63.3	 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people 
ISA.63.4	For the day of vengeance 
ISA.63.5	 And I looked, and 
ISA.63.6	And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
ISA.63.7	I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the 
ISA.63.8	For he said, Surely they 
ISA.63.9	In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, 
ISA.63.11	Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, 
ISA.63.12	 that led 
ISA.63.13	that led them through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness, 
ISA.63.14	As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the 
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where 
ISA.63.16	Doubtless thou 
ISA.63.17	O 
ISA.63.18	The people of thy holiness have possessed 
ISA.63.19	We are 
ISA.64.1	Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, 
ISA.64.2	as 
ISA.64.3	When thou didst terrible things 
ISA.64.4	 For since the beginning of the world 
ISA.64.5	Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, 
ISA.64.6	But we are all as an unclean 
ISA.64.7	And 
ISA.64.8	But now, O 
ISA.64.9	Be not wroth very sore, O 
ISA.64.10	Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 
ISA.64.11	Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste. 
ISA.64.12	Wilt thou refrain thyself for these 
ISA.65.2	 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way 
ISA.65.3	a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; 
ISA.65.4	which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments; which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable 
ISA.65.5	which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These 
ISA.65.6	Behold, 
ISA.65.7	your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the 
ISA.65.8	Thus saith the 
ISA.65.9	And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. 
ISA.65.10	 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. 
ISA.65.11	But ye 
ISA.65.12	Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose 
ISA.65.13	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
ISA.65.14	behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. 
ISA.65.15	And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord 
ISA.65.16	that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
ISA.65.18	But be ye glad and rejoice for ever 
ISA.65.19	 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. 
ISA.65.20	There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die a hundred years old; but the sinner 
ISA.65.21	And they shall build houses, and inhabit 
ISA.65.22	They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree 
ISA.65.23	They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they 
ISA.65.24	And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. 
ISA.65.25	 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust 
ISA.66.2	For all those 
ISA.66.3	He that killeth an ox 
ISA.66.4	I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose 
ISA.66.5	Hear the word of the 
ISA.66.6	A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the 
ISA.66.8	Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? 
ISA.66.9	Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the 
ISA.66.10	Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: 
ISA.66.11	that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. 
ISA.66.12	For thus saith the 
ISA.66.13	As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. 
ISA.66.14	And when ye see 
ISA.66.15	For, behold, the 
ISA.66.16	For by fire and by his sword will the 
ISA.66.17	They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one 
ISA.66.18	For I 
ISA.66.19	And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, 
ISA.66.20	And they shall bring all your brethren 
ISA.66.21	And I will also take of them for priests 
ISA.66.23	And it shall come to pass, 
ISA.66.24	 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilki´ah, of the priests that 
JER.1.2	 to whom the word of the 
JER.1.3	 It came also in the days of Jehoi´akim the son of Josi´ah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedeki´ah the son of Josi´ah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
JER.1.4	Then the word of the 
JER.1.5	Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, 
JER.1.6	Then said I, Ah, Lord 
JER.1.7	But the 
JER.1.8	Be not afraid of their faces: for I 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.10	See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
JER.1.11	Moreover the word of the 
JER.1.12	Then said the 
JER.1.13	And the word of the 
JER.1.14	Then the 
JER.1.15	For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the 
JER.1.16	And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands. 
JER.1.17	Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them. 
JER.1.18	For, behold, I have made thee this day a defensed city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. 
JER.1.19	And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I 
JER.2.1	Moreover the word of the 
JER.2.2	Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.2.3	Israel 
JER.2.4	Hear ye the word of the 
JER.2.5	thus saith the 
JER.2.6	Neither said they, Where 
JER.2.7	And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination. 
JER.2.8	The priests said not, Where 
JER.2.9	Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the 
JER.2.10	For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing. 
JER.2.11	Hath a nation changed 
JER.2.12	Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the 
JER.2.13	For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, 
JER.2.15	The young lions roared upon him, 
JER.2.16	Also the children of Noph and Tah´panhes have broken the crown of thy head. 
JER.2.17	Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the 
JER.2.18	And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river? 
JER.2.19	Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that 
JER.2.20	For of old time I have broken thy yoke, 
JER.2.21	Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me? 
JER.2.22	For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, 
JER.2.23	How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Ba´alim? See thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: 
JER.2.24	a wild ass used to the wilderness, 
JER.2.25	Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
JER.2.26	As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, 
JER.2.27	saying to a stock, Thou 
JER.2.28	But where 
JER.2.29	Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the 
JER.2.30	In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. 
JER.2.31	O generation, see ye the word of the 
JER.2.32	Can a maid forget her ornaments, 
JER.2.33	Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways. 
JER.2.34	Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these. 
JER.2.35	Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned. 
JER.2.36	Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. 
JER.2.37	Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the 
JER.3.1	They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the 
JER.3.2	Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lain with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness. 
JER.3.3	Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed. 
JER.3.4	Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou 
JER.3.5	Will he reserve 
JER.3.7	And I said after she had done all these 
JER.3.8	And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery, I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also. 
JER.3.9	And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks. 
JER.3.10	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the 
JER.3.11	And the 
JER.3.12	Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the 
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the 
JER.3.14	Turn, O backsliding children, saith the 
JER.3.15	And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. 
JER.3.16	And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the 
JER.3.17	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the 
JER.3.18	In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.
JER.3.19	But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me. 
JER.3.20	Surely 
JER.3.21	A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping 
JER.3.22	Return, ye backsliding children, 
JER.3.23	Truly in vain 
JER.3.24	For shame hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
JER.3.25	We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the 
JER.4.1	If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the 
JER.4.2	And thou shalt swear, The 
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to the 
JER.4.5	Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defensed cities. 
JER.4.6	Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction. 
JER.4.7	The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; 
JER.4.8	For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the 
JER.4.9	And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the 
JER.4.10	Then said I, Ah, Lord 
JER.4.11	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse, 
JER.4.12	 a full wind from those 
JER.4.13	Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots 
JER.4.14	O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? 
JER.4.15	For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount E´phra-im. 
JER.4.16	Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, 
JER.4.17	As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the 
JER.4.18	Thy way and thy doings have procured these 
JER.4.19	My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. 
JER.4.20	Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, 
JER.4.21	How long shall I see the standard, 
JER.4.22	For my people 
JER.4.23	I beheld the earth, and, lo, 
JER.4.24	I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. 
JER.4.25	I beheld, and, lo, 
JER.4.26	I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place 
JER.4.27	For thus hath the 
JER.4.28	For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken 
JER.4.29	The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city 
JER.4.30	And 
JER.4.31	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, 
JER.5.1	Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be 
JER.5.2	And though they say, The 
JER.5.3	O 
JER.5.4	Therefore I said, Surely these 
JER.5.5	I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the 
JER.5.6	Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, 
JER.5.7	How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by 
JER.5.8	They were 
JER.5.9	Shall I not visit for these 
JER.5.10	Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they 
JER.5.11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the 
JER.5.12	They have belied the 
JER.5.13	and the prophets shall become wind, and the word 
JER.5.14	Wherefore thus saith the 
JER.5.15	Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the 
JER.5.16	Their quiver 
JER.5.17	And they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread, 
JER.5.18	Nevertheless in those days, saith the 
JER.5.19	And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the 
JER.5.20	Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, 
JER.5.21	 Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not: 
JER.5.22	 Fear ye not me? saith the 
JER.5.23	But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone. 
JER.5.24	Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the 
JER.5.25	Your iniquities have turned away these 
JER.5.26	For among my people are found wicked 
JER.5.27	As a cage is full of birds, so 
JER.5.28	They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge. 
JER.5.29	Shall I not visit for these 
JER.5.30	A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; 
JER.5.31	the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love 
JER.6.1	O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Teko´a, and set up a sign of fire in Beth–hac´cerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction. 
JER.6.2	I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate 
JER.6.3	The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch 
JER.6.4	Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. 
JER.6.5	Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
JER.6.6	For thus hath the 
JER.6.7	As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually 
JER.6.8	Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.
JER.6.9	Thus saith the 
JER.6.10	To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ear 
JER.6.11	Therefore I am full of the fury of the 
JER.6.12	 And their houses shall be turned unto others, 
JER.6.13	For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one 
JER.6.14	 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when 
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush; therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time 
JER.6.17	Also I set watchmen over you, 
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what 
JER.6.19	Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, 
JER.6.20	To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings 
JER.6.21	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.6.22	Thus saith the 
JER.6.23	They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they 
JER.6.24	We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, 
JER.6.25	Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy 
JER.6.26	O daughter of my people, gird 
JER.6.27	I have set thee 
JER.6.28	They 
JER.6.29	The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. 
JER.6.30	Reprobate silver shall 
JER.7.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.7.2	Stand in the gate of the 
JER.7.3	Thus saith the 
JER.7.4	Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the 
JER.7.5	For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor; 
JER.7.6	 ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt; 
JER.7.7	then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.
JER.7.8	Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. 
JER.7.9	Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Ba´al, and walk after other gods whom ye know not; 
JER.7.10	and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations? 
JER.7.11	 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen 
JER.7.12	 But go ye now unto my place which 
JER.7.13	And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the 
JER.7.14	therefore will I do unto 
JER.7.15	And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, 
JER.7.16	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee. 
JER.7.17	Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead 
JER.7.19	Do they provoke me to anger? saith the 
JER.7.20	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
JER.7.21	Thus saith the 
JER.7.22	For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices: 
JER.7.23	but this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you. 
JER.7.24	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels 
JER.7.25	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending 
JER.7.26	yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.
JER.7.27	Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee. 
JER.7.28	But thou shalt say unto them, This 
JER.7.29	Cut off thine hair, 
JER.7.30	For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the 
JER.7.31	 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which 
JER.7.32	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.7.33	And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray 
JER.7.34	 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.
JER.8.1	At that time, saith the 
JER.8.2	and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. 
JER.8.3	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the 
JER.8.4	Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.8.5	Why 
JER.8.6	I hearkened and heard, 
JER.8.7	Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the 
JER.8.8	How do ye say, We 
JER.8.9	The wise 
JER.8.10	 Therefore will I give their wives unto others, 
JER.8.11	 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when 
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush; therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the 
JER.8.13	I will surely consume them, saith the 
JER.8.14	Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defensed cities, and let us be silent there: for the 
JER.8.15	We looked for peace, but no good 
JER.8.16	The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein. 
JER.8.17	For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which 
JER.8.19	Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: 
JER.8.20	The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. 
JER.8.21	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.
JER.9.1	Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! 
JER.9.2	Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they 
JER.9.3	And they bend their tongues 
JER.9.4	Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will walk with slanders. 
JER.9.5	And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, 
JER.9.6	Thine habitation 
JER.9.7	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.9.8	Their tongue 
JER.9.9	Shall I not visit them for these 
JER.9.10	For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through 
JER.9.11	And I will make Jerusalem heaps, 
JER.9.12	Who 
JER.9.13	And the 
JER.9.14	but have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Ba´alim, which their fathers taught them: 
JER.9.15	therefore thus saith the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.
JER.9.17	Thus saith the 
JER.9.18	and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. 
JER.9.19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast 
JER.9.20	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.9.21	For death is come up into our windows, 
JER.9.22	Speak, Thus saith the 
JER.9.23	Thus saith the 
JER.9.24	 but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I 
JER.9.25	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.9.26	Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all 
JER.10.1	Hear ye the word which the 
JER.10.2	thus saith the 
JER.10.3	For the customs of the people 
JER.10.4	They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. 
JER.10.5	They 
JER.10.6	Forasmuch as 
JER.10.7	 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise 
JER.10.8	But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock 
JER.10.9	Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple 
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.11	Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, 
JER.10.12	He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. 
JER.10.13	When he uttereth his voice, 
JER.10.14	Every man is brutish in 
JER.10.15	They 
JER.10.16	The portion of Jacob 
JER.10.17	Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress. 
JER.10.18	For thus saith the 
JER.10.19	Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this 
JER.10.20	My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they 
JER.10.21	For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the 
JER.10.22	Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, 
JER.10.23	O 
JER.10.24	O 
JER.10.25	Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
JER.11.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.11.2	Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 
JER.11.3	and say thou unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.11.4	which I commanded your fathers in the day 
JER.11.5	that I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as 
JER.11.6	Then the 
JER.11.7	For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day 
JER.11.8	Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded 
JER.11.9	And the 
JER.11.10	They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. 
JER.11.11	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.11.12	Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble. 
JER.11.13	For 
JER.11.14	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear 
JER.11.15	What hath my beloved to do in mine house, 
JER.11.16	The 
JER.11.17	For the 
JER.11.18	And the 
JER.11.19	But I 
JER.11.20	But, O 
JER.11.21	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.11.22	therefore thus saith the 
JER.11.23	and there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of An´athoth, 
JER.12.1	Righteous 
JER.12.2	Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou 
JER.12.3	But thou, O 
JER.12.4	How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.
JER.12.5	If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and 
JER.12.6	For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.
JER.12.7	I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. 
JER.12.8	Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it. 
JER.12.9	Mine heritage 
JER.12.10	Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. 
JER.12.11	They have made it desolate, 
JER.12.12	The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the 
JER.12.13	They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, 
JER.12.14	Thus saith the 
JER.12.15	And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. 
JER.12.16	And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The 
JER.12.17	But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the 
JER.13.1	Thus saith the 
JER.13.2	So I got a girdle according to the word of the 
JER.13.3	And the word of the 
JER.13.4	Take the girdle that thou hast got, which 
JER.13.5	So I went, and hid it by Euphra´tes, as the 
JER.13.6	And it came to pass after many days, that the 
JER.13.7	Then I went to Euphra´tes, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
JER.13.8	Then the word of the 
JER.13.9	Thus saith the 
JER.13.10	This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. 
JER.13.11	For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the 
JER.13.12	Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the 
JER.13.13	Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.13.14	And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the 
JER.13.15	Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the 
JER.13.16	Give glory to the 
JER.13.17	But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for 
JER.13.18	Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, 
JER.13.19	The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open 
JER.13.20	Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where 
JER.13.21	What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them 
JER.13.22	And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, 
JER.13.23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? 
JER.13.24	Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness. 
JER.13.25	This 
JER.13.26	Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear. 
JER.13.27	I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, 
JER.14.1	The word of the 
JER.14.2	Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. 
JER.14.3	And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, 
JER.14.4	Because the ground is chapped, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. 
JER.14.5	Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook 
JER.14.6	And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because 
JER.14.7	O 
JER.14.8	O the hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man 
JER.14.9	Why shouldest thou be as a man astonished, as a mighty man 
JER.14.10	Thus saith the 
JER.14.11	Then said the 
JER.14.12	When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
JER.14.13	Then said I, Ah, Lord 
JER.14.14	Then the 
JER.14.15	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.14.16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
JER.14.17	Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow. 
JER.14.18	If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
JER.14.19	Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and 
JER.14.20	We acknowledge, O 
JER.14.21	Do not abhor 
JER.14.22	Are there 
JER.15.2	 And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the 
JER.15.3	 And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the 
JER.15.4	 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manas´seh the son of Hezeki´ah king of Judah, for 
JER.15.5	For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest? 
JER.15.6	Thou hast forsaken me, saith the 
JER.15.7	And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave 
JER.15.8	Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused 
JER.15.9	She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while 
JER.15.10	Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; 
JER.15.11	The 
JER.15.12	Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? 
JER.15.13	Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and 
JER.15.14	And I will make 
JER.15.15	O 
JER.15.16	Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O 
JER.15.17	I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. 
JER.15.18	Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, 
JER.15.19	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.15.20	And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brazen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I 
JER.15.21	And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
JER.16.1	The word of the 
JER.16.2	Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons nor daughters in this place. 
JER.16.3	For thus saith the 
JER.16.4	They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; 
JER.16.5	For thus saith the 
JER.16.6	Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall 
JER.16.7	neither shall 
JER.16.8	Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink. 
JER.16.9	 For thus saith the 
JER.16.10	And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the 
JER.16.11	Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the 
JER.16.12	and ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me: 
JER.16.13	therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, 
JER.16.14	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.16.15	but, The 
JER.16.16	Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the 
JER.16.17	For mine eyes 
JER.16.18	And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.
JER.16.19	O 
JER.16.20	Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they 
JER.16.21	Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name 
JER.17.1	The sin of Judah 
JER.17.2	whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills. 
JER.17.3	O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance 
JER.17.4	And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, 
JER.17.5	Thus saith the 
JER.17.6	For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, 
JER.17.7	Blessed 
JER.17.8	 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and 
JER.17.9	The heart 
JER.17.10	 I the 
JER.17.11	 the partridge sitteth 
JER.17.12	A glorious high throne from the beginning 
JER.17.13	O 
JER.17.14	Heal me, O 
JER.17.15	Behold, they say unto me, Where 
JER.17.16	As for me, I have not hastened from 
JER.17.17	Be not a terror unto me: thou 
JER.17.18	Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
JER.17.19	Thus said the 
JER.17.20	and say unto them, Hear ye the word of the 
JER.17.21	 thus saith the 
JER.17.22	 neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. 
JER.17.23	But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.
JER.17.24	And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the 
JER.17.25	then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. 
JER.17.26	And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the 
JER.17.27	But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
JER.18.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.18.2	Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words. 
JER.18.3	Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. 
JER.18.4	And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make 
JER.18.5	Then the word of the 
JER.18.6	O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the 
JER.18.7	 instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy 
JER.18.8	if that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. 
JER.18.9	And 
JER.18.10	if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them. 
JER.18.11	Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.18.12	And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.
JER.18.13	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.18.14	Will 
JER.18.15	Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways 
JER.18.16	to make their land desolate, 
JER.18.17	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
JER.18.18	Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
JER.18.19	Give heed to me, O 
JER.18.20	Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, 
JER.18.21	Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their 
JER.18.22	Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet. 
JER.18.23	Yet, 
JER.19.1	Thus saith the 
JER.19.2	 and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which 
JER.19.3	and say, Hear ye the word of the 
JER.19.4	Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents; 
JER.19.5	 they have built also the high places of Ba´al, to burn their sons with fire 
JER.19.6	therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.19.7	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcasses will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. 
JER.19.8	And I will make this city desolate, and a hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss, because of all the plagues thereof. 
JER.19.9	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.
JER.19.10	Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, 
JER.19.11	and shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.19.12	Thus will I do unto this place, saith the 
JER.19.13	and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.
JER.19.14	Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the 
JER.19.15	Thus saith the 
JER.20.1	Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who 
JER.20.2	Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that 
JER.20.3	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The 
JER.20.4	For thus saith the 
JER.20.5	Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labors thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house, shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.
JER.20.7	O 
JER.20.8	For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the 
JER.20.9	Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But 
JER.20.10	For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, 
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.12	But, O 
JER.20.13	Sing unto the 
JER.20.15	Cursed 
JER.20.16	And let that man be as the cities which the 
JER.20.17	because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb 
JER.20.18	Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
JER.21.1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.21.2	 Inquire, I pray thee, of the 
JER.21.3	Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedeki´ah: 
JER.21.4	Thus saith the 
JER.21.5	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. 
JER.21.6	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence. 
JER.21.7	And afterward, saith the 
JER.21.8	And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the 
JER.21.9	He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chalde´ans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey. 
JER.21.10	For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the 
JER.21.11	And touching the house of the king of Judah, 
JER.21.12	O house of David, thus saith the 
JER.21.13	Behold, I 
JER.21.14	But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the 
JER.22.1	Thus saith the 
JER.22.2	and say, Hear the word of the 
JER.22.3	thus saith the 
JER.22.4	For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. 
JER.22.5	But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the 
JER.22.6	For thus saith the 
JER.22.7	And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast 
JER.22.8	And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath the 
JER.22.9	Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the 
JER.22.10	Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him; 
JER.22.12	but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
JER.22.13	Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; 
JER.22.14	that saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and 
JER.22.15	Shalt thou reign, because thou closest 
JER.22.16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then 
JER.22.17	But thine eyes and thine heart 
JER.22.19	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
JER.22.20	Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed. 
JER.22.21	I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; 
JER.22.22	The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness. 
JER.22.23	O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
JER.22.25	and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand 
JER.22.26	And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die. 
JER.22.27	But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return. 
JER.22.28	 this man Coni´ah a despised broken idol? 
JER.22.29	O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the 
JER.22.30	Thus saith the 
JER.23.1	Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the 
JER.23.2	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.23.3	And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase. 
JER.23.4	And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the 
JER.23.6	In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this 
JER.23.7	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.23.8	but, The 
JER.23.9	Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake: I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the 
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force 
JER.23.11	For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the 
JER.23.12	Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery 
JER.23.13	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Ba´al, and caused my people Israel to err. 
JER.23.14	 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomor´rah. 
JER.23.15	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.23.16	Thus saith the 
JER.23.17	They say still unto them that despise me, The 
JER.23.18	For who hath stood in the counsel of the 
JER.23.19	Behold, a whirlwind of the 
JER.23.20	The anger of the 
JER.23.21	I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. 
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
JER.23.24	Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the 
JER.23.25	I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. 
JER.23.26	How long shall 
JER.23.27	which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams, which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Ba´al. 
JER.23.28	The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What 
JER.23.29	 not my word like as a fire? saith the 
JER.23.30	Therefore, behold, I 
JER.23.31	Behold, I 
JER.23.32	Behold, I 
JER.23.33	And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What 
JER.23.34	And 
JER.23.35	Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath the 
JER.23.36	And the burden of the 
JER.23.37	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the 
JER.23.38	But since ye say, The burden of the 
JER.23.39	therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, 
JER.23.40	and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
JER.24.2	One basket 
JER.24.3	Then said the 
JER.24.4	Again the word of the 
JER.24.5	Thus saith the 
JER.24.6	For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull 
JER.24.7	And I will give them a heart to know me, that I 
JER.24.8	And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the 
JER.24.9	and I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for 
JER.24.10	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.
JER.25.2	the which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 
JER.25.3	From the thirteenth year of Josi´ah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that 
JER.25.4	And the 
JER.25.5	They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the 
JER.25.6	and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt. 
JER.25.7	Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the 
JER.25.8	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.25.9	behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the 
JER.25.10	 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle. 
JER.25.11	 And this whole land shall be a desolation, 
JER.25.12	And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, 
JER.25.13	And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, 
JER.25.14	For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
JER.25.15	For thus saith the 
JER.25.16	And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
JER.25.17	Then took I the cup at the 
JER.25.18	, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse; as 
JER.25.19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; 
JER.25.20	and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ash´kelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod, 
JER.25.21	Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon, 
JER.25.22	and all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which 
JER.25.23	Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all 
JER.25.24	and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert, 
JER.25.25	and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes, 
JER.25.26	and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which 
JER.25.27	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.25.28	And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.25.29	For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the 
JER.25.30	Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The 
JER.25.31	A noise shall come 
JER.25.32	Thus saith the 
JER.25.33	And the slain of the 
JER.25.34	Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves 
JER.25.35	And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. 
JER.25.36	A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the principal of the flock, 
JER.25.37	And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.25.38	He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.
JER.26.2	Thus saith the 
JER.26.3	if so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings. 
JER.26.4	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.26.5	to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending 
JER.26.6	 then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth. 
JER.26.7	So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the 
JER.26.8	Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the 
JER.26.9	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.10	When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the 
JER.26.11	Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man 
JER.26.12	Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The 
JER.26.13	Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the 
JER.26.14	As for me, behold, I 
JER.26.15	But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the 
JER.26.16	Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man 
JER.26.17	Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying, 
JER.26.18	 Micah the Mor´asthite prophesied in the days of Hezeki´ah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.26.19	Did Hezeki´ah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the 
JER.26.20	And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.21	and when Jehoi´akim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Uri´jah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; 
JER.26.22	and Jehoi´akim the king sent men into Egypt, 
JER.26.23	And they fetched forth Uri´jah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoi´akim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
JER.26.24	Nevertheless, the hand of Ahi´kam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
JER.27.2	Thus saith the 
JER.27.3	and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedeki´ah king of Judah; 
JER.27.4	and command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the 
JER.27.5	I have made the earth, the man and the beast that 
JER.27.6	And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnez´zar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him. 
JER.27.7	And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.
JER.27.8	And it shall come to pass, 
JER.27.9	Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: 
JER.27.10	for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish. 
JER.27.11	But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the 
JER.27.12	I spake also to Zedeki´ah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. 
JER.27.13	Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the 
JER.27.14	Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you. 
JER.27.15	For I have not sent them, saith the 
JER.27.16	Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.27.17	Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste? 
JER.27.18	But if they 
JER.27.19	For thus saith the 
JER.27.20	which Nebuchadnez´zar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconi´ah the son of Jehoi´akim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 
JER.27.21	yea, thus saith the 
JER.27.22	They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the 
JER.28.2	Thus speaketh the 
JER.28.3	Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the 
JER.28.4	and I will bring again to this place Jeconi´ah the son of Jehoi´akim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the 
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hanani´ah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the 
JER.28.6	even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the 
JER.28.7	Nevertheless, hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people; 
JER.28.8	The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. 
JER.28.9	The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, 
JER.28.10	Then Hanani´ah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it. 
JER.28.11	And Hanani´ah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.28.12	Then the word of the 
JER.28.13	Go and tell Hanani´ah, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.28.14	For thus saith the 
JER.28.15	Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hanani´ah the prophet, Hear now, Hanani´ah; The 
JER.28.16	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.28.17	So Hanani´ah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
JER.29.2	(after that Jeconi´ah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;) 
JER.29.3	by the hand of Ela´sah the son of Shaphan, and Gemari´ah the son of Hilki´ah, (whom Zedeki´ah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnez´zar king of Babylon) saying, 
JER.29.4	Thus saith the 
JER.29.5	Build ye houses, and dwell 
JER.29.6	take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished. 
JER.29.7	And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the 
JER.29.8	For thus saith the 
JER.29.9	For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the 
JER.29.11	For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the 
JER.29.12	Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. 
JER.29.13	 And ye shall seek me, and find 
JER.29.14	And I will be found of you, saith the 
JER.29.15	Because ye have said, The 
JER.29.16	 that thus saith the 
JER.29.17	thus saith the 
JER.29.18	And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them: 
JER.29.19	because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the 
JER.29.20	Hear ye therefore the word of the 
JER.29.21	Thus saith the 
JER.29.22	and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which 
JER.29.23	because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and 
JER.29.25	Thus speaketh the 
JER.29.26	The 
JER.29.27	Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of An´athoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you? 
JER.29.28	For therefore he sent unto us 
JER.29.29	And Zephani´ah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. 
JER.29.30	Then came the word of the 
JER.29.31	Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.29.32	therefore thus saith the 
JER.30.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.30.2	Thus speaketh the 
JER.30.3	For, lo, the days come, saith the 
JER.30.4	And these 
JER.30.5	For thus saith the 
JER.30.6	Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? 
JER.30.7	Alas! for that day 
JER.30.8	For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
JER.30.9	but they shall serve the 
JER.30.10	 Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the 
JER.30.11	For I 
JER.30.12	For thus saith the 
JER.30.13	 none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. 
JER.30.14	All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; 
JER.30.15	Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow 
JER.30.16	Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. 
JER.30.17	For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the 
JER.30.18	Thus saith the 
JER.30.19	And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small. 
JER.30.20	Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them. 
JER.30.21	And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who 
JER.30.22	And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
JER.30.23	Behold, the whirlwind of the 
JER.30.24	The fierce anger of the 
JER.31.1	At the same time, saith the 
JER.31.2	Thus saith the 
JER.31.3	The 
JER.31.4	Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry. 
JER.31.5	Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat 
JER.31.6	For there shall be a day, 
JER.31.7	For thus saith the 
JER.31.8	Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, 
JER.31.9	They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and E´phra-im 
JER.31.10	Hear the word of the 
JER.31.11	For the 
JER.31.12	Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the 
JER.31.13	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. 
JER.31.14	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the 
JER.31.16	Thus saith the 
JER.31.17	And there is hope in thine end, saith the 
JER.31.18	I have surely heard E´phra-im bemoaning himself 
JER.31.19	Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon 
JER.31.20	 E´phra-im my dear son? 
JER.31.21	Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, 
JER.31.22	How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the 
JER.31.23	Thus saith the 
JER.31.24	And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they 
JER.31.25	For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. 
JER.31.26	Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
JER.31.27	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.31.28	And it shall come to pass, 
JER.31.29	 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. 
JER.31.30	But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
JER.31.32	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day 
JER.31.33	 but this 
JER.31.34	 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the 
JER.31.35	Thus saith the 
JER.31.36	If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the 
JER.31.37	Thus saith the 
JER.31.38	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.31.39	And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Go´ath. 
JER.31.40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, 
JER.32.2	For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which 
JER.32.3	For Zedeki´ah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the 
JER.32.4	and Zedeki´ah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chalde´ans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; 
JER.32.5	and he shall lead Zedeki´ah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the 
JER.32.6	And Jeremiah said, The word of the 
JER.32.7	Behold, Han´ameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that 
JER.32.8	So Han´ameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the 
JER.32.9	And I bought the field of Han´ameel my uncle's son, that 
JER.32.10	And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed 
JER.32.11	So I took the evidence of the purchase, 
JER.32.12	and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neri´ah, the son of Ma-asei´ah, in the sight of Han´ameel mine uncle's 
JER.32.13	And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 
JER.32.14	Thus saith the 
JER.32.15	For thus saith the 
JER.32.16	Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neri´ah, I prayed unto the 
JER.32.17	Ah Lord 
JER.32.18	thou showest loving-kindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: The Great, The Mighty God, The 
JER.32.19	great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes 
JER.32.20	which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, 
JER.32.21	and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror; 
JER.32.22	and hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
JER.32.23	and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them. 
JER.32.24	Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chalde´ans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest 
JER.32.25	And thou hast said unto me, O Lord 
JER.32.26	Then came the word of the 
JER.32.27	Behold, I 
JER.32.28	 Therefore thus saith the 
JER.32.29	and the Chalde´ans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Ba´al, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger. 
JER.32.30	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the 
JER.32.31	For this city hath been to me 
JER.32.32	because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
JER.32.33	And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching 
JER.32.34	 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it. 
JER.32.35	 And they built the high places of Ba´al, which 
JER.32.36	And now therefore thus saith the 
JER.32.37	Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely: 
JER.32.38	and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: 
JER.32.39	and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: 
JER.32.40	and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. 
JER.32.41	Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
JER.32.42	For thus saith the 
JER.32.43	And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, 
JER.32.44	Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal 
JER.33.1	Moreover the word of the 
JER.33.2	Thus saith the 
JER.33.3	Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. 
JER.33.4	For thus saith the 
JER.33.5	They come to fight with the Chalde´ans, but 
JER.33.6	Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. 
JER.33.7	And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. 
JER.33.8	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. 
JER.33.9	And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
JER.33.10	Thus saith the 
JER.33.11	 the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the 
JER.33.12	Thus saith the 
JER.33.13	In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth 
JER.33.15	In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land. 
JER.33.16	In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this 
JER.33.18	 neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
JER.33.19	And the word of the 
JER.33.20	Thus saith the 
JER.33.21	 may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. 
JER.33.22	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.
JER.33.23	Moreover the word of the 
JER.33.24	Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the 
JER.33.25	Thus saith the 
JER.33.26	then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, 
JER.34.2	Thus saith the 
JER.34.3	and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. 
JER.34.4	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.34.5	 thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn 
JER.34.6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedeki´ah king of Judah in Jerusalem, 
JER.34.7	when the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Aze´kah: for these defensed cities remained of the cities of Judah.
JER.34.9	that every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, 
JER.34.10	Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more; then they obeyed, and let 
JER.34.11	But afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
JER.34.12	Therefore the word of the 
JER.34.13	Thus saith the 
JER.34.14	 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother a Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear. 
JER.34.15	And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: 
JER.34.16	but ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.
JER.34.17	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.34.18	And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof, 
JER.34.19	the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf; 
JER.34.20	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. 
JER.34.21	And Zedeki´ah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you. 
JER.34.22	Behold, I will command, saith the 
JER.35.2	Go unto the house of the Rech´abites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the 
JER.35.3	Then I took Ja-azani´ah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazini´ah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rech´abites; 
JER.35.4	and I brought them into the house of the 
JER.35.5	and I set before the sons of the house of the Rech´abites pots full of wine, and cups; and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. 
JER.35.6	But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jon´adab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, 
JER.35.7	neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have 
JER.35.8	Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jon´adab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 
JER.35.9	nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed: 
JER.35.10	but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jon´adab our father commanded us. 
JER.35.11	But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrez´zar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chalde´ans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.
JER.35.12	Then came the word of the 
JER.35.13	Thus saith the 
JER.35.14	The words of Jon´adab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me. 
JER.35.15	I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending 
JER.35.16	Because the sons of Jon´adab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me: 
JER.35.17	therefore thus saith the 
JER.35.18	And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rech´abites, Thus saith the 
JER.35.19	therefore thus saith the 
JER.36.2	Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josi´ah, even unto this day. 
JER.36.3	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
JER.36.4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neri´ah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the 
JER.36.5	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I 
JER.36.6	therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the 
JER.36.7	It may be they will present their supplication before the 
JER.36.8	And Baruch the son of Neri´ah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the 
JER.36.9	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoi´akim the son of Josi´ah king of Judah, in the ninth month, 
JER.36.10	Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the 
JER.36.11	When Michai´ah the son of Gemari´ah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the 
JER.36.12	then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, 
JER.36.13	Then Michai´ah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 
JER.36.14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehu´di the son of Nethani´ah, the son of Shelemi´ah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neri´ah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. 
JER.36.15	And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read 
JER.36.16	Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words. 
JER.36.17	And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, how didst thou write all these words at his mouth? 
JER.36.18	Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote 
JER.36.19	Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.
JER.36.20	And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elish´ama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king. 
JER.36.21	So the king sent Jehu´di to fetch the roll; and he took it out of Elish´ama the scribe's chamber. And Jehu´di read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king. 
JER.36.22	Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and 
JER.36.23	And it came to pass, 
JER.36.24	Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, 
JER.36.25	Nevertheless Elna´than and Delai´ah and Gemari´ah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them. 
JER.36.26	But the king commanded Jerah´meel the son of Ham´melech, and Serai´ah the son of Az´ri-el, and Shelemi´ah the son of Ab´deel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the 
JER.36.27	Then the word of the 
JER.36.28	Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoi´akim the king of Judah hath burned. 
JER.36.29	And thou shalt say to Jehoi´akim king of Judah, Thus saith the 
JER.36.30	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.36.31	And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.
JER.36.32	Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neri´ah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoi´akim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.
JER.37.2	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the 
JER.37.3	And Zedeki´ah the king sent Jehu´cal the son of Shelemi´ah and Zephani´ah the son of Ma-asei´ah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the 
JER.37.4	Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison. 
JER.37.5	Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chalde´ans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.
JER.37.6	Then came the word of the 
JER.37.7	Thus saith the 
JER.37.8	And the Chalde´ans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire. 
JER.37.9	Thus saith the 
JER.37.10	For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chalde´ans that fight against you, and there remained 
JER.37.11	And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chalde´ans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, 
JER.37.12	then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people. 
JER.37.13	And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward 
JER.37.14	Then said Jeremiah, 
JER.37.15	Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.
JER.37.16	When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; 
JER.37.17	then Zedeki´ah the king sent, and took him out; and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there 
JER.37.18	Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedeki´ah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	Where 
JER.37.20	Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. 
JER.37.21	Then Zedeki´ah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
JER.38.1	Then Shephati´ah the son of Mattan, and Gedali´ah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemi´ah, and Pashur the son of Malchi´ah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying, 
JER.38.2	Thus saith the 
JER.38.3	Thus saith the 
JER.38.4	Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt. 
JER.38.5	Then Zedeki´ah the king said, Behold, he 
JER.38.6	Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchi´ah the son of Ham´melech, that 
JER.38.7	Now when E´bed–mel´ech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; 
JER.38.8	E´bed–mel´ech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying, 
JER.38.9	My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for 
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded E´bed–mel´ech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die. 
JER.38.11	So E´bed–mel´ech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. 
JER.38.12	And E´bed–mel´ech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now 
JER.38.13	So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
JER.38.14	Then Zedeki´ah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that 
JER.38.15	Then Jeremiah said unto Zedeki´ah, If I declare 
JER.38.16	So Zedeki´ah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, 
JER.38.17	Then said Jeremiah unto Zedeki´ah, Thus saith the 
JER.38.18	but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chalde´ans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. 
JER.38.19	And Zedeki´ah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chalde´ans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me. 
JER.38.20	But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver 
JER.38.21	But if thou refuse to go forth, this 
JER.38.22	And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house 
JER.38.23	So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chalde´ans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
JER.38.24	Then said Zedeki´ah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die. 
JER.38.25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee: 
JER.38.26	Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there. 
JER.38.27	Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them, according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. 
JER.38.28	 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was 
JER.39.1	In the ninth year of Zedeki´ah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrez´zar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it. 
JER.39.2	 in the eleventh year of Zedeki´ah, in the fourth month, the ninth 
JER.39.3	And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, 
JER.39.4	And it came to pass, 
JER.39.5	But the Chalde´ans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedeki´ah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnez´zar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him. 
JER.39.6	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedeki´ah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. 
JER.39.7	Moreover he put out Zedeki´ah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon. 
JER.39.8	And the Chalde´ans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	Then Neb´uzar–a´dan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained. 
JER.39.10	But Neb´uzar–a´dan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
JER.39.11	Now Nebuchadrez´zar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Neb´uzar–a´dan the captain of the guard, saying, 
JER.39.12	Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee. 
JER.39.13	So Neb´uzar–a´dan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushas´ban, Rab–sa´ris, and Ner´gal–share´zer, Rab–mag, and all the king of Babylon's princes; 
JER.39.14	even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedali´ah the son of Ahi´kam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.
JER.39.15	Now the word of the 
JER.39.16	Go and speak to E´bed–mel´ech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.39.17	But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the 
JER.39.18	For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the 
JER.40.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.40.2	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The 
JER.40.3	Now the 
JER.40.4	And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which 
JER.40.5	Now while he was not yet gone back, 
JER.40.6	Then went Jeremiah unto Gedali´ah the son of Ahi´kam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
JER.40.8	then they came to Gedali´ah to Mizpah, even Ish´ma-el the son of Nethani´ah, and Jo´hanan and Jonathan the sons of Kare´ah, and Serai´ah the son of Tan´humeth, and the sons of E´phai the Netoph´athite, and Jezani´ah the son of a Ma-ach´athite, they and their men. 
JER.40.9	And Gedali´ah the son of Ahi´kam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chalde´ans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. 
JER.40.10	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chalde´ans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put 
JER.40.11	Likewise when all the Jews that 
JER.40.12	even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedali´ah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
JER.40.13	Moreover Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah, and all the captains of the forces that 
JER.40.14	and said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Ba´alis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ish´ma-el the son of Nethani´ah to slay thee? But Gedali´ah the son of Ahi´kam believed them not. 
JER.40.15	Then Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah spake to Gedali´ah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ish´ma-el the son of Nethani´ah, and no man shall know 
JER.40.16	But Gedali´ah the son of Ahi´kam said unto Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ish´ma-el.
JER.41.2	Then arose Ish´ma-el the son of Nethani´ah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedali´ah the son of Ahi´kam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. 
JER.41.3	Ish´ma-el also slew all the Jews that were with him, 
JER.41.4	And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedali´ah, and no man knew 
JER.41.5	that there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, 
JER.41.6	And Ish´ma-el the son of Nethani´ah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedali´ah the son of Ahi´kam. 
JER.41.7	And it was 
JER.41.8	But ten men were found among them that said unto Ish´ma-el, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.
JER.41.9	Now the pit wherein Ish´ma-el had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedali´ah, 
JER.41.10	Then Ish´ma-el carried away captive all the residue of the people that 
JER.41.11	But when Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah, and all the captains of the forces that 
JER.41.12	then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ish´ma-el the son of Nethani´ah, and found him by the great waters that 
JER.41.13	Now it came to pass, 
JER.41.14	So all the people that Ish´ma-el had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah. 
JER.41.15	But Ish´ma-el the son of Nethani´ah escaped from Jo´hanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites. 
JER.41.16	Then took Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah, and all the captains of the forces that 
JER.41.17	and they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, 
JER.41.18	because of the Chalde´ans: for they were afraid of them, because Ish´ma-el the son of Nethani´ah had slain Gedali´ah the son of Ahi´kam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.
JER.42.1	Then all the captains of the forces, and Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah, and Jezani´ah the son of Hoshai´ah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near, 
JER.42.2	and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the 
JER.42.3	that the 
JER.42.4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, The 
JER.42.6	Whether 
JER.42.7	And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the 
JER.42.8	Then called he Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah, and all the captains of the forces which 
JER.42.9	and said unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.42.10	If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull 
JER.42.11	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the 
JER.42.12	And I will show mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land. 
JER.42.13	But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the 
JER.42.14	saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell: 
JER.42.15	and now therefore hear the word of the 
JER.42.16	then it shall come to pass, 
JER.42.17	So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
JER.42.18	For thus saith the 
JER.42.19	The 
JER.42.20	For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the 
JER.42.21	And 
JER.42.22	Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go 
JER.43.1	And it came to pass, 
JER.43.2	then spake Azari´ah the son of Hoshai´ah, and Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the 
JER.43.3	but Baruch the son of Neri´ah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chalde´ans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. 
JER.43.4	So Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the 
JER.43.5	 But Jo´hanan the son of Kare´ah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah; 
JER.43.6	 men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Neb´uzar–a´dan the captain of the guard had left with Gedali´ah the son of Ahi´kam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neri´ah. 
JER.43.7	So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the 
JER.43.8	Then came the word of the 
JER.43.9	Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which 
JER.43.10	and say unto them, Thus saith the 
JER.43.11	And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, 
JER.43.12	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. 
JER.43.13	He shall break also the images of Beth–she´mesh,
JER.44.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tah´panhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 
JER.44.2	Thus saith the 
JER.44.3	because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, 
JER.44.4	Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending 
JER.44.5	But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. 
JER.44.6	Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted 
JER.44.7	Therefore now thus saith the 
JER.44.8	in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 
JER.44.9	Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	They are not humbled 
JER.44.11	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.44.12	And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, 
JER.44.13	For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: 
JER.44.14	so that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.
JER.44.15	Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, 
JER.44.16	 the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the 
JER.44.17	But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for 
JER.44.18	But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all 
JER.44.19	And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him 
JER.44.21	The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the 
JER.44.22	so that the 
JER.44.23	Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the 
JER.44.24	Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the 
JER.44.25	Thus saith the 
JER.44.26	Therefore hear ye the word of the 
JER.44.27	Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that 
JER.44.28	Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs. 
JER.44.29	And this 
JER.44.30	 Thus saith the 
JER.45.2	Thus saith the 
JER.45.3	Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the 
JER.45.4	Thus shalt thou say unto him, The 
JER.45.5	And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek 
JER.46.1	The word of the 
JER.46.2	 against Egypt, against the army of Pha´raoh–ne´cho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphra´tes in Car´chemish, which Nebuchadrez´zar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoi´akim the son of Josi´ah king of Judah.
JER.46.3	Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. 
JER.46.4	Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with 
JER.46.5	Wherefore have I seen them dismayed 
JER.46.6	Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphra´tes.
JER.46.7	Who 
JER.46.8	Egypt riseth up like a flood, and 
JER.46.9	Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle 
JER.46.10	For this 
JER.46.11	Go up into Gil´e-ad, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; 
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, 
JER.46.14	Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tah´panhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee. 
JER.46.15	Why are thy valiant 
JER.46.16	He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword. 
JER.46.17	They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt 
JER.46.19	O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant. 
JER.46.20	Egypt 
JER.46.21	Also her hired men 
JER.46.22	The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. 
JER.46.23	They shall cut down her forest, saith the 
JER.46.24	The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrez´zar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the 
JER.46.28	Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the 
JER.47.2	Thus saith the 
JER.47.3	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong 
JER.47.4	because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, 
JER.47.5	Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ash´kelon is cut off 
JER.47.6	O thou sword of the 
JER.47.7	How can it be quiet, seeing the 
JER.48.2	 no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from 
JER.48.3	A voice of crying 
JER.48.4	Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard. 
JER.48.5	For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horona´im the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. 
JER.48.6	Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. 
JER.48.7	For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity 
JER.48.8	And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the 
JER.48.9	Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.
JER.48.10	Cursed 
JER.48.11	Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed. 
JER.48.12	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.48.13	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth–el their confidence.
JER.48.14	How say ye, We 
JER.48.15	Moab is spoiled, and gone up 
JER.48.16	The calamity of Moab 
JER.48.17	All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, 
JER.48.18	Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from 
JER.48.19	O inhabitant of Aro´er, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, 
JER.48.20	Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled, 
JER.48.21	and judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jaha´zah, and upon Meph´a-ath, 
JER.48.22	and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth–diblatha´im, 
JER.48.23	and upon Kiri-atha´im, and upon Beth–ga´mul, and upon Beth–me´on, 
JER.48.24	and upon Ker´i-oth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. 
JER.48.25	The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the 
JER.48.26	Make ye him drunken; for he magnified 
JER.48.27	For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy. 
JER.48.28	O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove 
JER.48.29	We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud,) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart. 
JER.48.30	I know his wrath, saith the 
JER.48.31	Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; 
JER.48.32	O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach 
JER.48.33	And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; 
JER.48.34	From the cry of Heshbon 
JER.48.35	Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the 
JER.48.36	Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir–he´res: because the riches 
JER.48.37	For every head 
JER.48.38	 lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein 
JER.48.39	They shall howl, 
JER.48.40	For thus saith the 
JER.48.41	Ker´i-oth is taken, and the strongholds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. 
JER.48.42	And Moab shall be destroyed from 
JER.48.43	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, 
JER.48.44	He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, 
JER.48.45	They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. 
JER.48.46	Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives. 
JER.48.47	Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the 
JER.49.2	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.49.3	Howl, O Heshbon, for A´i is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, 
JER.49.4	Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, 
JER.49.5	Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord 
JER.49.6	And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the 
JER.49.8	Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time 
JER.49.9	If grape gatherers come to thee, would they not leave 
JER.49.10	But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbors, and he 
JER.49.11	Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve 
JER.49.12	For thus saith the 
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by myself, saith the 
JER.49.14	I have heard a rumor from the 
JER.49.15	For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, 
JER.49.16	Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, 
JER.49.17	Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. 
JER.49.18	 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomor´rah and the neighbor 
JER.49.19	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who 
JER.49.20	Therefore hear the counsel of the 
JER.49.21	The earth is moved at the noise of their fall; at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. 
JER.49.22	Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
JER.49.24	Damascus is waxed feeble, 
JER.49.25	How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! 
JER.49.26	Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the 
JER.49.27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben–ha´dad.
JER.49.28	Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrez´zar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the 
JER.49.29	Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear 
JER.49.30	Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the 
JER.49.31	Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the 
JER.49.32	And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them 
JER.49.33	And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, 
JER.49.34	The word of the 
JER.49.35	Thus saith the 
JER.49.36	And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. 
JER.49.37	For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, 
JER.49.38	and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the 
JER.49.39	But it shall come to pass in the latter days, 
JER.50.2	Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, 
JER.50.3	For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
JER.50.4	In those days, and in that time, saith the 
JER.50.5	They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, 
JER.50.6	My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away 
JER.50.7	All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the 
JER.50.9	For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows 
JER.50.10	And Chalde´a shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the 
JER.50.11	Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; 
JER.50.12	your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations 
JER.50.13	Because of the wrath of the 
JER.50.14	Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the 
JER.50.15	Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it 
JER.50.16	Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
JER.50.17	Israel 
JER.50.18	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.50.19	And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount E´phra-im and Gil´e-ad. 
JER.50.20	In those days, and in that time, saith the 
JER.50.21	Go up against the land of Meratha´im,
JER.50.22	A sound of battle 
JER.50.23	How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! 
JER.50.24	I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the 
JER.50.25	The 
JER.50.26	Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. 
JER.50.27	Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. 
JER.50.28	The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the 
JER.50.30	Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the 
JER.50.31	Behold, I 
JER.50.32	And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
JER.50.33	Thus saith the 
JER.50.34	Their Redeemer 
JER.50.35	A sword 
JER.50.36	A sword 
JER.50.37	A sword 
JER.50.38	A drought 
JER.50.39	 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell 
JER.50.40	 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomor´rah and the neighbor 
JER.50.41	Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. 
JER.50.42	They shall hold the bow and the lance: they 
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, 
JER.50.44	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who 
JER.50.45	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the 
JER.50.46	At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.
JER.51.1	Thus saith the 
JER.51.2	and will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about. 
JER.51.3	Against 
JER.51.4	Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chalde´ans, and 
JER.51.5	For Israel 
JER.51.6	Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this 
JER.51.7	 Babylon 
JER.51.8	Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed. 
JER.51.9	 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up 
JER.51.10	The 
JER.51.11	Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the 
JER.51.12	Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the 
JER.51.13	 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, 
JER.51.14	The 
JER.51.15	He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding. 
JER.51.16	When he uttereth 
JER.51.17	Every man is brutish by 
JER.51.18	They 
JER.51.19	The portion of Jacob 
JER.51.20	Thou 
JER.51.21	and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; 
JER.51.22	with thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid; 
JER.51.23	I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers. 
JER.51.24	And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chalde´a all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the 
JER.51.25	Behold, I 
JER.51.26	And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the 
JER.51.27	Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ar´arat, Minni, and Ash´kenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars. 
JER.51.28	Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion. 
JER.51.29	And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the 
JER.51.30	The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they have remained in 
JER.51.31	One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at 
JER.51.32	and that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted. 
JER.51.33	For thus saith the 
JER.51.34	Nebuchadrez´zar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out. 
JER.51.35	The violence done to me and to my flesh 
JER.51.36	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.51.37	And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and a hissing, without an inhabitant. 
JER.51.38	They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps. 
JER.51.39	In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the 
JER.51.40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.
JER.51.41	How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations! 
JER.51.42	The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. 
JER.51.43	Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth 
JER.51.44	And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him; yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
JER.51.45	My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the 
JER.51.46	And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumor that shall be heard in the land; a rumor shall both come 
JER.51.47	Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her. 
JER.51.48	 Then the heaven and the earth, and all that 
JER.51.49	 As Babylon 
JER.51.50	Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the 
JER.51.51	We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces; for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the 
JER.51.52	Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.51.53	Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, 
JER.51.54	A sound of a cry 
JER.51.55	because the 
JER.51.56	because the spoiler is come upon her, 
JER.51.57	And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise 
JER.51.58	Thus saith the 
JER.51.59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Serai´ah the son of Neri´ah, the son of Ma-asei´ah, when he went with Zedeki´ah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And 
JER.51.60	So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, 
JER.51.61	And Jeremiah said to Serai´ah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words; 
JER.51.62	then shalt thou say, O 
JER.51.63	 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, 
JER.51.64	and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary.
JER.51.64	Thus far 
JER.52.1	Zedeki´ah 
JER.52.2	And he did 
JER.52.3	For through the anger of the 
JER.52.5	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedeki´ah. 
JER.52.6	And in the fourth month, in the ninth 
JER.52.7	 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which 
JER.52.8	But the army of the Chalde´ans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedeki´ah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. 
JER.52.9	Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him. 
JER.52.10	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedeki´ah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
JER.52.11	 Then he put out the eyes of Zedeki´ah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
JER.52.12	Now in the fifth month, in the tenth 
JER.52.13	 and burned the house of the 
JER.52.14	and all the army of the Chalde´ans, that 
JER.52.15	Then Neb´uzar–a´dan the captain of the guard carried away captive 
JER.52.16	But Neb´uzar–a´dan the captain of the guard left 
JER.52.18	The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. 
JER.52.19	And the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; 
JER.52.20	The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that 
JER.52.21	And 
JER.52.22	And a chapiter of brass 
JER.52.23	And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; 
JER.52.24	And the captain of the guard took Serai´ah the chief priest, and Zephani´ah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 
JER.52.25	he took also out of the city a eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. 
JER.52.26	So Neb´uzar–a´dan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
JER.52.27	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
JER.52.28	This 
JER.52.29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrez´zar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: 
JER.52.30	in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrez´zar, Neb´uzar–a´dan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons 
JER.52.31	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoi´achin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth 
JER.52.32	and spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that 
JER.52.33	and changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life. 
JER.52.34	And 
LAM.1.1	How doth the city sit solitary,
LAM.1.1	She 
LAM.1.2	She weepeth sore in the night,
LAM.1.2	and her tears 
LAM.1.2	among all her lovers she hath none to comfort 
LAM.1.2	all her friends have dealt treacherously with her,
LAM.1.2	they are become her enemies.
LAM.1.3	Judah is gone into captivity
LAM.1.3	because of affliction, and because of great servitude:
LAM.1.3	she dwelleth among the heathen,
LAM.1.3	she findeth no rest:
LAM.1.3	all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
LAM.1.4	The ways of Zion do mourn,
LAM.1.4	because none come to the solemn feasts:
LAM.1.4	all her gates are desolate:
LAM.1.4	her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted,
LAM.1.4	and she 
LAM.1.5	Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper;
LAM.1.5	for the 
LAM.1.5	her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
LAM.1.6	And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed:
LAM.1.6	her princes are become like harts 
LAM.1.6	and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries
LAM.1.7	all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old,
LAM.1.7	when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her:
LAM.1.7	the adversaries saw her, 
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem hath grievously sinned;
LAM.1.8	therefore she is removed:
LAM.1.8	all that honored her despise her,
LAM.1.8	because they have seen her nakedness:
LAM.1.8	yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.
LAM.1.9	Her filthiness 
LAM.1.9	she remembereth not her last end;
LAM.1.9	therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter.
LAM.1.9	O 
LAM.1.9	for the enemy hath magnified 
LAM.1.10	The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things:
LAM.1.10	for she hath seen 
LAM.1.10	whom thou didst command 
LAM.1.11	All her people sigh, they seek bread;
LAM.1.11	they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul:
LAM.1.11	see, O 
LAM.1.12	Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow,
LAM.1.12	which is done unto me,
LAM.1.12	wherewith the 
LAM.1.13	From above hath he sent fire into my bones,
LAM.1.13	and it prevaileth against them:
LAM.1.13	he hath spread a net for my feet,
LAM.1.13	he hath turned me back:
LAM.1.13	he hath made me desolate 
LAM.1.14	The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand:
LAM.1.14	they are wreathed, 
LAM.1.14	he hath made my strength to fall,
LAM.1.14	the Lord hath delivered me into 
LAM.1.15	The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty 
LAM.1.15	he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men:
LAM.1.15	the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, 
LAM.1.16	For these 
LAM.1.16	mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water,
LAM.1.16	because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me:
LAM.1.16	my children are desolate,
LAM.1.16	because the enemy prevailed.
LAM.1.17	Zion spreadeth forth her hands,
LAM.1.17	the 
LAM.1.17	Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.
LAM.1.18	The 
LAM.1.18	for I have rebelled against his commandment:
LAM.1.18	hear, I pray you, all people,
LAM.1.18	and behold my sorrow:
LAM.1.18	my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
LAM.1.19	I called for my lovers, 
LAM.1.19	my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city,
LAM.1.19	while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.
LAM.1.20	Behold, O 
LAM.1.20	my bowels are troubled;
LAM.1.20	mine heart is turned within me;
LAM.1.20	for I have grievously rebelled:
LAM.1.20	abroad the sword bereaveth,
LAM.1.20	at home 
LAM.1.21	They have heard that I sigh;
LAM.1.21	all mine enemies have heard of my trouble;
LAM.1.21	they are glad that thou hast done 
LAM.1.21	thou wilt bring the day 
LAM.1.21	and they shall be like unto me.
LAM.1.22	Let all their wickedness come before thee;
LAM.1.22	and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions:
LAM.1.22	for my sighs 
LAM.2.1	How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger,
LAM.2.1	and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
LAM.2.2	The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob,
LAM.2.2	and hath not pitied:
LAM.2.2	he hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;
LAM.2.2	he hath brought 
LAM.2.2	he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
LAM.2.3	He hath cut off in 
LAM.2.3	he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy,
LAM.2.3	and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, 
LAM.2.4	He hath bent his bow like an enemy:
LAM.2.4	he stood with his right hand as an adversary,
LAM.2.4	and slew all 
LAM.2.4	he poured out his fury like fire.
LAM.2.5	The Lord was as an enemy:
LAM.2.5	he hath swallowed up Israel,
LAM.2.5	he hath swallowed up all her palaces:
LAM.2.5	he hath destroyed his strongholds,
LAM.2.5	and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
LAM.2.6	And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as 
LAM.2.6	he hath destroyed his places of the assembly:
LAM.2.6	the 
LAM.2.6	and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
LAM.2.7	The Lord hath cast off his altar,
LAM.2.7	he hath abhorred his sanctuary,
LAM.2.7	he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces;
LAM.2.7	they have made a noise in the house of the 
LAM.2.7	as in the day of a solemn feast.
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.8	the wall of the daughter of Zion:
LAM.2.8	he hath stretched out a line,
LAM.2.8	he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying:
LAM.2.8	therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament;
LAM.2.8	they languished together.
LAM.2.9	Her gates are sunk into the ground;
LAM.2.9	he hath destroyed and broken her bars:
LAM.2.9	her king and her princes 
LAM.2.9	the law 
LAM.2.9	her prophets also find no vision from the 
LAM.2.10	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, 
LAM.2.10	they have cast up dust upon their heads;
LAM.2.10	they have girded themselves with sackcloth:
LAM.2.10	the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
LAM.2.11	Mine eyes do fail with tears,
LAM.2.11	my bowels are troubled,
LAM.2.11	my liver is poured upon the earth,
LAM.2.11	for the destruction of the daughter of my people;
LAM.2.11	because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	They say to their mothers, Where 
LAM.2.12	when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city,
LAM.2.12	when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
LAM.2.13	What thing shall I take to witness for thee?
LAM.2.13	What thing shall I liken to thee,
LAM.2.13	O daughter of Jerusalem?
LAM.2.13	What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee,
LAM.2.13	O virgin daughter of Zion?
LAM.2.13	For thy breach 
LAM.2.13	who can heal thee?
LAM.2.14	Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee:
LAM.2.14	and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity;
LAM.2.14	but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
LAM.2.15	All that pass by clap 
LAM.2.15	they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, 
LAM.2.16	All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee:
LAM.2.16	they hiss and gnash the teeth:
LAM.2.16	they say, We have swallowed 
LAM.2.16	certainly this 
LAM.2.16	we have found, we have seen 
LAM.2.17	The 
LAM.2.17	he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old:
LAM.2.17	he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied:
LAM.2.17	and he hath caused 
LAM.2.17	he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
LAM.2.18	Their heart cried unto the Lord,
LAM.2.18	O wall of the daughter of Zion,
LAM.2.18	let tears run down like a river day and night:
LAM.2.18	give thyself no rest;
LAM.2.18	let not the apple of thine eye cease.
LAM.2.19	Arise, cry out in the night:
LAM.2.19	in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord:
LAM.2.19	lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children,
LAM.2.19	that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
LAM.2.20	Behold, O 
LAM.2.20	Shall the women eat their fruit, 
LAM.2.20	Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
LAM.2.21	The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets:
LAM.2.21	my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword;
LAM.2.21	thou hast slain 
LAM.2.21	thou hast killed, 
LAM.2.22	Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about,
LAM.2.22	so that in the day of the 
LAM.2.22	those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
LAM.3.1	I 
LAM.3.2	He hath led me, and brought 
LAM.3.3	Surely against me is he turned;
LAM.3.3	he turneth his hand 
LAM.3.4	My flesh and my skin hath he made old;
LAM.3.4	he hath broken my bones.
LAM.3.5	He hath builded against me,
LAM.3.5	and compassed 
LAM.3.6	He hath set me in dark places,
LAM.3.6	as 
LAM.3.7	He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out:
LAM.3.7	he hath made my chain heavy.
LAM.3.8	Also when I cry and shout,
LAM.3.8	he shutteth out my prayer.
LAM.3.9	He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone;
LAM.3.9	he hath made my paths crooked.
LAM.3.10	He 
LAM.3.11	He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces:
LAM.3.11	he hath made me desolate.
LAM.3.12	He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
LAM.3.13	He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
LAM.3.14	I was a derision to all my people;
LAM.3.15	He hath filled me with bitterness,
LAM.3.15	he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
LAM.3.16	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones,
LAM.3.16	he hath covered me with ashes.
LAM.3.17	And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace:
LAM.3.17	I forgat prosperity.
LAM.3.18	And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the 
LAM.3.19	remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
LAM.3.20	My soul hath 
LAM.3.21	This I recall to my mind,
LAM.3.21	therefore have I hope.
LAM.3.22	because his compassions fail not.
LAM.3.23	great 
LAM.3.24	The 
LAM.3.24	therefore will I hope in him.
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.25	to the soul 
LAM.3.28	He sitteth alone and keepeth silence,
LAM.3.28	because he hath borne 
LAM.3.29	He putteth his mouth in the dust;
LAM.3.29	if so be there may be hope.
LAM.3.30	He giveth 
LAM.3.30	he is filled full with reproach.
LAM.3.31	For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
LAM.3.32	but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion
LAM.3.32	according to the multitude of his mercies.
LAM.3.33	For he doth not afflict willingly,
LAM.3.33	nor grieve the children of men.
LAM.3.34	To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
LAM.3.35	to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
LAM.3.36	to subvert a man in his cause,
LAM.3.36	the Lord approveth not.
LAM.3.37	Who 
LAM.3.38	Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not evil and good?
LAM.3.39	Wherefore doth a living man complain,
LAM.3.39	a man for the punishment of his sins?
LAM.3.40	Let us search and try our ways,
LAM.3.40	and turn again to the 
LAM.3.41	Let us lift up our heart with 
LAM.3.42	We have transgressed and have rebelled:
LAM.3.42	thou hast not pardoned.
LAM.3.43	Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us:
LAM.3.43	thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
LAM.3.44	Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,
LAM.3.44	that 
LAM.3.45	Thou hast made us 
LAM.3.46	All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
LAM.3.47	Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
LAM.3.48	Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water
LAM.3.48	for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.3.49	Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
LAM.3.50	till the 
LAM.3.51	Mine eye affecteth mine heart,
LAM.3.51	because of all the daughters of my city.
LAM.3.52	Mine enemies chased me sore,
LAM.3.52	like a bird, without cause.
LAM.3.53	They have cut off my life in the dungeon,
LAM.3.53	and cast a stone upon me.
LAM.3.54	Waters flowed over mine head;
LAM.3.55	I called upon thy name, O 
LAM.3.55	out of the low dungeon.
LAM.3.56	Thou hast heard my voice:
LAM.3.56	hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
LAM.3.57	Thou drewest near in the day 
LAM.3.57	thou saidst, Fear not.
LAM.3.58	O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul;
LAM.3.58	thou hast redeemed my life.
LAM.3.59	O 
LAM.3.59	judge thou my cause.
LAM.3.60	Thou hast seen all their vengeance 
LAM.3.61	Thou hast heard their reproach, O 
LAM.3.62	the lips of those that rose up against me,
LAM.3.62	and their device against me all the day.
LAM.3.63	Behold their sitting down, and their rising up;
LAM.3.63	I 
LAM.3.64	Render unto them a recompense, O 
LAM.3.64	according to the work of their hands.
LAM.3.65	Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.
LAM.3.66	Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the 
LAM.4.1	How is the gold become dim!
LAM.4.1	The stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.
LAM.4.2	The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold,
LAM.4.2	how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers,
LAM.4.2	the work of the hands of the potter!
LAM.4.3	Even the sea monsters draw out the breast,
LAM.4.3	they give suck to their young ones:
LAM.4.3	the daughter of my people 
LAM.4.3	like the ostriches in the wilderness.
LAM.4.4	The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst:
LAM.4.4	the young children ask bread, 
LAM.4.5	They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:
LAM.4.5	they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
LAM.4.6	is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom,
LAM.4.6	that was overthrown as in a moment,
LAM.4.6	and no hands stayed on her.
LAM.4.7	Her Nazarites were purer than snow,
LAM.4.7	they were whiter than milk,
LAM.4.7	they were more ruddy in body than rubies,
LAM.4.7	their polishing 
LAM.4.8	their visage is blacker than a coal;
LAM.4.8	they are not known in the streets:
LAM.4.8	their skin cleaveth to their bones;
LAM.4.8	it is withered, it is become like a stick.
LAM.4.9	for these pine away, stricken through for 
LAM.4.10	they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.11	he hath poured out his fierce anger,
LAM.4.11	and hath kindled a fire in Zion,
LAM.4.11	and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,
LAM.4.12	would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
LAM.4.13	For the sins of her prophets, 
LAM.4.13	that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
LAM.4.14	they have wandered 
LAM.4.14	they have polluted themselves with blood,
LAM.4.14	so that men could not touch their garments.
LAM.4.15	They cried unto them, Depart ye;
LAM.4.15	when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen,
LAM.4.15	They shall no more sojourn 
LAM.4.16	The anger of the 
LAM.4.16	he will no more regard them:
LAM.4.16	they respected not the persons of the priests,
LAM.4.16	they favored not the elders.
LAM.4.17	As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help:
LAM.4.17	in our watching we have watched for a nation 
LAM.4.18	They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets:
LAM.4.18	our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
LAM.4.19	Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven:
LAM.4.19	they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
LAM.4.20	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the 
LAM.4.20	was taken in their pits, of whom we said,
LAM.4.20	Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,
LAM.4.21	that dwellest in the land of Uz;
LAM.4.21	the cup also shall pass through unto thee:
LAM.4.21	thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
LAM.4.22	The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion;
LAM.4.22	he will no more carry thee away into captivity:
LAM.4.22	he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom;
LAM.4.22	he will discover thy sins.
LAM.5.1	Remember, O 
LAM.5.1	consider, and behold our reproach.
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance is turned to strangers,
LAM.5.2	our houses to aliens.
LAM.5.3	We are orphans and fatherless,
LAM.5.3	our mothers 
LAM.5.4	We have drunken our water for money;
LAM.5.4	our wood is sold unto us.
LAM.5.5	Our necks 
LAM.5.5	we labor, 
LAM.5.6	We have given the hand 
LAM.5.6	to be satisfied with bread.
LAM.5.7	Our fathers have sinned, and 
LAM.5.7	and we have borne their iniquities.
LAM.5.8	Servants have ruled over us:
LAM.5.9	We gat our bread with 
LAM.5.9	because of the sword of the wilderness.
LAM.5.10	Our skin was black like an oven,
LAM.5.10	because of the terrible famine.
LAM.5.11	They ravished the women in Zion,
LAM.5.12	Princes are hanged up by their hand:
LAM.5.12	the faces of elders were not honored.
LAM.5.13	They took the young men to grind,
LAM.5.13	and the children fell under the wood.
LAM.5.14	The elders have ceased from the gate,
LAM.5.14	the young men from their music.
LAM.5.15	The joy of our heart is ceased;
LAM.5.15	our dance is turned into mourning.
LAM.5.16	The crown is fallen 
LAM.5.16	woe unto us, that we have sinned!
LAM.5.17	For this our heart is faint;
LAM.5.17	for these 
LAM.5.18	Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate,
LAM.5.18	the foxes walk upon it.
LAM.5.19	Thou, O 
LAM.5.19	thy throne from generation to generation.
LAM.5.20	Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
LAM.5.21	Turn thou us unto thee, O 
LAM.5.21	renew our days as of old.
LAM.5.22	But thou hast utterly rejected us;
LAM.5.22	thou art very wroth against us.
EZK.1.2	 In the fifth 
EZK.1.3	the word of the 
EZK.1.4	And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness 
EZK.1.5	 Also out of the midst thereof 
EZK.1.6	And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. 
EZK.1.7	And their feet 
EZK.1.8	And 
EZK.1.9	Their wings 
EZK.1.10	 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle. 
EZK.1.11	Thus 
EZK.1.12	And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; 
EZK.1.13	 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance 
EZK.1.14	And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
EZK.1.16	The appearance of the wheels and their work 
EZK.1.17	When they went, they went upon their four sides: 
EZK.1.18	 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings 
EZK.1.19	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 
EZK.1.20	Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither 
EZK.1.21	When those went, 
EZK.1.23	And under the firmament 
EZK.1.24	 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings. 
EZK.1.25	And there was a voice from the firmament that 
EZK.1.27	 And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. 
EZK.1.28	As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so 
EZK.1.28	This 
EZK.2.1	And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. 
EZK.2.2	And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. 
EZK.2.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, 
EZK.2.4	For 
EZK.2.5	And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they 
EZK.2.6	And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns 
EZK.2.7	And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they 
EZK.2.8	But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee. 
EZK.2.9	 And when I looked, behold, a hand 
EZK.2.10	and he spread it before me; and it 
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. 
EZK.3.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat 
EZK.3.4	And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. 
EZK.3.5	For thou 
EZK.3.6	not to many people of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee. 
EZK.3.7	But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel 
EZK.3.8	Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. 
EZK.3.9	As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they 
EZK.3.10	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. 
EZK.3.11	And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.3.12	Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, 
EZK.3.13	 also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. 
EZK.3.14	So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the 
EZK.3.15	Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel–a´bib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
EZK.3.16	And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the 
EZK.3.17	Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. 
EZK.3.18	When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked 
EZK.3.19	Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 
EZK.3.20	Again, When a righteous 
EZK.3.21	Nevertheless, if thou warn the righteous 
EZK.3.22	And the hand of the 
EZK.3.23	Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.3.24	Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house. 
EZK.3.25	But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: 
EZK.3.26	and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they 
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.4.1	Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it the city, 
EZK.4.2	and lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set 
EZK.4.3	Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it 
EZK.4.4	Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: 
EZK.4.5	For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
EZK.4.6	And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year. 
EZK.4.7	Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm 
EZK.4.8	And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.
EZK.4.9	Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, 
EZK.4.10	And thy meat which thou shalt eat 
EZK.4.11	Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink. 
EZK.4.12	And thou shalt eat it 
EZK.4.13	And the 
EZK.4.14	Then said I, Ah Lord 
EZK.4.15	Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. 
EZK.4.16	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment: 
EZK.4.17	that they may want bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.
EZK.5.1	And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause 
EZK.5.2	Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, 
EZK.5.3	Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts. 
EZK.5.4	Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; 
EZK.5.5	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.5.6	And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that 
EZK.5.7	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.5.8	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.5.9	And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations. 
EZK.5.10	 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds. 
EZK.5.11	Wherefore, 
EZK.5.12	A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
EZK.5.13	Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the 
EZK.5.14	Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that 
EZK.5.15	So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that 
EZK.5.16	When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for 
EZK.5.17	 so will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the 
EZK.6.1	And the word of the 
EZK.6.2	Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, 
EZK.6.3	and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.6.4	And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain 
EZK.6.5	And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. 
EZK.6.6	In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. 
EZK.6.7	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I 
EZK.6.8	Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have 
EZK.6.9	And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. 
EZK.6.10	And they shall know that I 
EZK.6.11	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.6.12	He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them. 
EZK.6.13	Then shall ye know that I 
EZK.6.14	So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I 
EZK.7.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.7.2	Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.7.3	Now 
EZK.7.4	And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I 
EZK.7.5	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.7.6	An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come. 
EZK.7.7	The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble 
EZK.7.8	Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations. 
EZK.7.9	And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations 
EZK.7.10	Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. 
EZK.7.11	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them 
EZK.7.12	The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath 
EZK.7.13	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision 
EZK.7.14	They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath 
EZK.7.15	The sword 
EZK.7.16	But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity. 
EZK.7.17	All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak 
EZK.7.18	They shall also gird 
EZK.7.19	They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the 
EZK.7.20	As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations 
EZK.7.21	And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it. 
EZK.7.22	My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret 
EZK.7.23	Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. 
EZK.7.24	Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled. 
EZK.7.25	Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and 
EZK.7.26	Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. 
EZK.7.27	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I 
EZK.8.1	And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth 
EZK.8.2	 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber. 
EZK.8.3	And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where 
EZK.8.4	 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel 
EZK.8.5	Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. 
EZK.8.6	He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? 
EZK.8.7	And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. 
EZK.8.9	And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here. 
EZK.8.10	So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about. 
EZK.8.11	And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Ja-azani´ah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up. 
EZK.8.12	Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The 
EZK.8.13	He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, 
EZK.8.14	Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the 
EZK.8.15	Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen 
EZK.8.16	And he brought me into the inner court of the 
EZK.8.17	Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen 
EZK.8.18	Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, 
EZK.9.1	He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man 
EZK.9.2	And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them 
EZK.9.3	And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which 
EZK.9.4	 and the 
EZK.9.5	And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: 
EZK.9.6	slay utterly old 
EZK.9.7	And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city. 
EZK.9.8	And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord 
EZK.9.9	Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah 
EZK.9.10	And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, 
EZK.9.11	And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which 
EZK.10.2	 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, 
EZK.10.2	And he went in in my sight. 
EZK.10.3	Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. 
EZK.10.4	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.5	And the sound of the cherubim's wings was heard 
EZK.10.6	And it came to pass, 
EZK.10.7	And 
EZK.10.8	And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.
EZK.10.10	And 
EZK.10.11	When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. 
EZK.10.12	 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, 
EZK.10.13	As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel. 
EZK.10.14	 And every one had four faces: the first face 
EZK.10.15	And the cherubim were lifted up. This 
EZK.10.16	And when the cherubim went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. 
EZK.10.17	When they stood, 
EZK.10.18	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.19	And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also 
EZK.10.20	This 
EZK.10.21	Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man 
EZK.10.22	And the likeness of their faces 
EZK.11.1	Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the 
EZK.11.2	Then said he unto me, Son of man, these 
EZK.11.3	which say, 
EZK.11.4	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
EZK.11.5	And the Spirit of the 
EZK.11.6	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain. 
EZK.11.7	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.11.8	Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord 
EZK.11.9	And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. 
EZK.11.10	Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I 
EZK.11.11	This 
EZK.11.12	and ye shall know that I 
EZK.11.13	And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelati´ah the son of Benai´ah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord 
EZK.11.14	Again the word of the 
EZK.11.15	Son of man, thy brethren, 
EZK.11.16	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.11.17	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.11.18	And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. 
EZK.11.19	 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh: 
EZK.11.20	that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	But 
EZK.11.23	And the glory of the 
EZK.11.24	Afterward the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chalde´a, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
EZK.11.25	Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the 
EZK.12.1	The word of the 
EZK.12.2	 Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they 
EZK.12.3	Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they 
EZK.12.4	Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity. 
EZK.12.5	Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby. 
EZK.12.6	In their sight shalt thou bear 
EZK.12.7	And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought 
EZK.12.8	And in the morning came the word of the 
EZK.12.9	Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou? 
EZK.12.10	Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.12.11	Say, I 
EZK.12.12	And the prince that 
EZK.12.13	 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon 
EZK.12.14	And I will scatter toward every wind all that 
EZK.12.15	And they shall know that I 
EZK.12.16	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I 
EZK.12.17	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.12.18	Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness; 
EZK.12.19	and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.12.20	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I 
EZK.12.21	And the word of the 
EZK.12.22	Son of man, what 
EZK.12.23	Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.12.24	For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. 
EZK.12.25	For I 
EZK.12.26	Again the word of the 
EZK.12.27	Son of man, behold, 
EZK.12.28	Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.1	And the word of the 
EZK.13.2	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the 
EZK.13.3	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.4	O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts. 
EZK.13.5	Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the 
EZK.13.6	They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The 
EZK.13.7	Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The 
EZK.13.8	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.9	And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I 
EZK.13.10	 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and 
EZK.13.11	say unto them which daub 
EZK.13.12	Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where 
EZK.13.13	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.14	So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered 
EZK.13.15	Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered 
EZK.13.16	, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and 
EZK.13.17	Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them, 
EZK.13.18	and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.19	And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear 
EZK.13.20	Wherefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.13.21	Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I 
EZK.13.22	Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life; 
EZK.13.23	therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I 
EZK.14.1	Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me. 
EZK.14.2	And the word of the 
EZK.14.3	Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them? 
EZK.14.4	Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.14.5	that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
EZK.14.6	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.14.7	For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the 
EZK.14.8	and I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I 
EZK.14.9	And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the 
EZK.14.10	And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh 
EZK.14.11	that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord 
EZK.14.12	The word of the 
EZK.14.13	Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it: 
EZK.14.14	though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver 
EZK.14.15	If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts: 
EZK.14.16	 these three men 
EZK.14.17	Or 
EZK.14.18	though these three men 
EZK.14.19	Or 
EZK.14.20	though Noah, Daniel, and Job, 
EZK.14.22	Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, 
EZK.14.23	And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord 
EZK.15.1	And the word of the 
EZK.15.2	Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, 
EZK.15.3	Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will 
EZK.15.4	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for 
EZK.15.5	Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for 
EZK.15.6	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.15.7	And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from 
EZK.15.8	And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.1	Again the word of the 
EZK.16.2	Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 
EZK.16.3	and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.16.4	And 
EZK.16.5	None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the loathing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.
EZK.16.6	And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee 
EZK.16.7	I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: 
EZK.16.8	Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time 
EZK.16.9	Then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil. 
EZK.16.10	I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk. 
EZK.16.11	I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. 
EZK.16.12	And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head. 
EZK.16.13	Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment 
EZK.16.14	And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it 
EZK.16.15	But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was. 
EZK.16.16	And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colors, and playedst the harlot thereupon: 
EZK.16.17	Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them, 
EZK.16.18	and tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them. 
EZK.16.19	My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, 
EZK.16.20	Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. 
EZK.16.21	that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through 
EZK.16.22	And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, 
EZK.16.23	And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord 
EZK.16.24	 thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee a high place in every street. 
EZK.16.25	Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms. 
EZK.16.26	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger. 
EZK.16.27	Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary 
EZK.16.28	Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied. 
EZK.16.29	Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chalde´a; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.
EZK.16.30	How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.31	in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire; 
EZK.16.32	 a wife that committeth adultery, 
EZK.16.33	They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom. 
EZK.16.34	And the contrary is in thee from 
EZK.16.35	Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the 
EZK.16.36	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.16.37	behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all 
EZK.16.38	And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy. 
EZK.16.39	And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare. 
EZK.16.40	They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. 
EZK.16.41	And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more. 
EZK.16.42	So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. 
EZK.16.43	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these 
EZK.16.44	Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use 
EZK.16.45	Thou 
EZK.16.46	And thine elder sister 
EZK.16.47	Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as 
EZK.16.48	 I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.16.49	Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. 
EZK.16.50	And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw 
EZK.16.51	Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done. 
EZK.16.52	Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
EZK.16.53	When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then 
EZK.16.54	that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them. 
EZK.16.55	When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate. 
EZK.16.56	For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride, 
EZK.16.57	before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of 
EZK.16.58	Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the 
EZK.16.59	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.16.60	Nevertheless, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. 
EZK.16.61	Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. 
EZK.16.62	And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I 
EZK.16.63	that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord 
EZK.17.1	And the word of the 
EZK.17.2	Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel; 
EZK.17.3	and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.4	he cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants. 
EZK.17.5	He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed 
EZK.17.6	And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
EZK.17.7	There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation. 
EZK.17.8	It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine. 
EZK.17.9	Say thou, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.10	Yea, behold, 
EZK.17.11	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.17.12	 Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these 
EZK.17.13	and hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land: 
EZK.17.14	that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, 
EZK.17.15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such 
EZK.17.16	 I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.17.17	Neither shall Pharaoh with 
EZK.17.18	seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these 
EZK.17.19	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.20	And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me. 
EZK.17.21	And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the 
EZK.17.22	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.17.23	in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell. 
EZK.17.24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I the 
EZK.18.1	The word of the 
EZK.18.2	 What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? 
EZK.18.3	 I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.18.4	Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
EZK.18.5	But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 
EZK.18.6	 hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbor's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, 
EZK.18.7	and hath not oppressed any, 
EZK.18.8	he 
EZK.18.9	 hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he 
EZK.18.10	If he beget a son 
EZK.18.11	and that doeth not any of those 
EZK.18.12	hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, 
EZK.18.13	hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
EZK.18.14	Now, lo, 
EZK.18.15	 hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbor's wife, 
EZK.18.16	neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, 
EZK.18.17	 hath taken off his hand from the poor, 
EZK.18.18	 his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did 
EZK.18.19	Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, 
EZK.18.20	 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
EZK.18.21	But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
EZK.18.22	All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. 
EZK.18.23	Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord 
EZK.18.24	But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, 
EZK.18.25	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal? 
EZK.18.26	When a righteous 
EZK.18.27	Again, when the wicked 
EZK.18.28	Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
EZK.18.29	Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
EZK.18.30	Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord 
EZK.18.31	Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 
EZK.18.32	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord 
EZK.19.1	Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 
EZK.19.2	and say,
EZK.19.2	What 
EZK.19.2	she lay down among lions,
EZK.19.2	she nourished her whelps
EZK.19.2	among young lions.
EZK.19.3	And she brought up one of her whelps:
EZK.19.3	it became a young lion,
EZK.19.3	and it learned to catch the prey;
EZK.19.3	it devoured men.
EZK.19.4	The nations also heard of him;
EZK.19.4	he was taken in their pit,
EZK.19.4	and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.
EZK.19.5	Now when she saw that she had waited,
EZK.19.5	then she took another of her whelps,
EZK.19.6	And he went up and down among the lions,
EZK.19.6	he became a young lion,
EZK.19.6	and learned to catch the prey,
EZK.19.7	And he knew their desolate palaces,
EZK.19.7	and he laid waste their cities;
EZK.19.7	and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof,
EZK.19.7	by the noise of his roaring.
EZK.19.8	Then the nations set against him
EZK.19.8	on every side from the provinces,
EZK.19.8	and spread their net over him:
EZK.19.8	he was taken in their pit.
EZK.19.9	And they put him in ward in chains,
EZK.19.9	and brought him to the king of Babylon:
EZK.19.9	they brought him into holds,
EZK.19.9	that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
EZK.19.10	Thy mother 
EZK.19.10	planted by the waters:
EZK.19.10	she was fruitful and full of branches
EZK.19.10	by reason of many waters.
EZK.19.11	And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule,
EZK.19.11	and her stature was exalted among the thick branches,
EZK.19.11	and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.
EZK.19.12	But she was plucked up in fury,
EZK.19.12	she was cast down to the ground,
EZK.19.12	and the east wind dried up her fruit:
EZK.19.12	her strong rods were broken and withered;
EZK.19.12	the fire consumed them.
EZK.19.13	And now she 
EZK.19.13	in a dry and thirsty ground.
EZK.19.14	And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches,
EZK.19.14	so that she hath no strong rod
EZK.19.14	This 
EZK.20.1	And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth 
EZK.20.2	Then came the word of the 
EZK.20.3	Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.4	Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge 
EZK.20.5	 and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.6	in the day 
EZK.20.7	then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I 
EZK.20.8	But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt.
EZK.20.8	Then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 
EZK.20.9	But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they 
EZK.20.10	Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. 
EZK.20.11	 And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which 
EZK.20.12	 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I 
EZK.20.13	 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which 
EZK.20.13	Then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. 
EZK.20.14	But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out. 
EZK.20.15	 Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given 
EZK.20.16	because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols. 
EZK.20.17	Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
EZK.20.18	But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols: 
EZK.20.19	I 
EZK.20.20	and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I 
EZK.20.21	 Notwithstanding, the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which 
EZK.20.21	Then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. 
EZK.20.22	Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth. 
EZK.20.23	 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries; 
EZK.20.24	because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols. 
EZK.20.25	Wherefore I gave them also statutes 
EZK.20.26	and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through 
EZK.20.27	Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.28	 when I had brought them into the land, 
EZK.20.29	Then I said unto them, What 
EZK.20.30	Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.31	For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? 
EZK.20.32	And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
EZK.20.34	and I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out. 
EZK.20.35	And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face. 
EZK.20.36	Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord 
EZK.20.37	And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant: 
EZK.20.38	and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I 
EZK.20.39	As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.20.40	For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord 
EZK.20.41	I will accept you with your sweet savor, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen. 
EZK.20.42	And ye shall know that I 
EZK.20.43	And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed. 
EZK.20.44	And ye shall know that I 
EZK.20.45	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.20.46	Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop 
EZK.20.47	and say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the 
EZK.20.48	And all flesh shall see that I the 
EZK.20.49	Then said I, Ah Lord 
EZK.21.1	And the word of the 
EZK.21.2	Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop 
EZK.21.3	and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the 
EZK.21.4	Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north: 
EZK.21.5	that all flesh may know that I the 
EZK.21.6	Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of 
EZK.21.7	And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings, because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak 
EZK.21.8	Again the word of the 
EZK.21.9	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the 
EZK.21.10	it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, 
EZK.21.11	And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. 
EZK.21.12	Cry and howl, son of man; for it shall be upon my people, it 
EZK.21.13	Because 
EZK.21.14	Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite 
EZK.21.15	I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that 
EZK.21.16	Go thee one way or other, 
EZK.21.17	I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the 
EZK.21.18	The word of the 
EZK.21.19	Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose 
EZK.21.20	Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defensed. 
EZK.21.21	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made 
EZK.21.22	At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint 
EZK.21.23	And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
EZK.21.24	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.21.25	And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity 
EZK.21.26	thus saith the Lord 
EZK.21.27	I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no 
EZK.21.29	while they see vanity unto thee, while they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of 
EZK.21.30	Shall I cause 
EZK.21.31	And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, 
EZK.21.32	Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no 
EZK.22.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.22.2	Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt show her all her abominations. 
EZK.22.3	Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.22.4	Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come 
EZK.22.5	 near, and 
EZK.22.6	Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood. 
EZK.22.7	 In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow. 
EZK.22.8	 Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths. 
EZK.22.9	In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness. 
EZK.22.10	 In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution. 
EZK.22.11	And one hath committed abomination with his neighbor's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. 
EZK.22.12	 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbors by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord 
EZK.22.13	Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee. 
EZK.22.14	Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the 
EZK.22.15	And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee. 
EZK.22.16	And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I 
EZK.22.17	And the word of the 
EZK.22.18	Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they 
EZK.22.19	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.22.20	 they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt 
EZK.22.21	Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof. 
EZK.22.22	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the 
EZK.22.23	And the word of the 
EZK.22.24	Son of man, say unto her, Thou 
EZK.22.25	 a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof. 
EZK.22.26	 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they showed 
EZK.22.27	Her princes in the midst thereof 
EZK.22.28	And her prophets have daubed them with untempered 
EZK.22.29	The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. 
EZK.22.30	And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none. 
EZK.22.31	Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord 
EZK.23.1	The word of the 
EZK.23.2	Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: 
EZK.23.3	and they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity. 
EZK.23.4	And the names of them 
EZK.23.5	And Aho´lah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians 
EZK.23.6	 clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. 
EZK.23.7	Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them 
EZK.23.8	Neither left she her whoredoms 
EZK.23.9	Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. 
EZK.23.10	These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
EZK.23.11	And when her sister Ahol´ibah saw 
EZK.23.12	She doted upon the Assyrians 
EZK.23.13	Then I saw that she was defiled, 
EZK.23.14	and 
EZK.23.15	girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chalde´a, the land of their nativity: 
EZK.23.16	and as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chalde´a. 
EZK.23.17	And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them. 
EZK.23.18	So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister. 
EZK.23.19	Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. 
EZK.23.20	For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh 
EZK.23.21	Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.
EZK.23.22	Therefore, O Ahol´ibah, thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.23	the Babylonians, and all the Chalde´ans, Pekod, and Sho´a, and Ko´a, 
EZK.23.24	And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, 
EZK.23.25	And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. 
EZK.23.26	They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels. 
EZK.23.27	Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom 
EZK.23.28	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.29	and they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. 
EZK.23.30	I will do these 
EZK.23.31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand. 
EZK.23.32	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. 
EZK.23.34	Thou shalt even drink it and suck 
EZK.23.35	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.37	that they have committed adultery, and blood 
EZK.23.38	Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. 
EZK.23.39	For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house. 
EZK.23.40	And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger 
EZK.23.41	and satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil. 
EZK.23.42	And a voice of a multitude being at ease 
EZK.23.43	Then said I unto 
EZK.23.44	Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aho´lah and unto Ahol´ibah, the lewd women. 
EZK.23.45	And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they 
EZK.23.46	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.23.47	And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. 
EZK.23.48	Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. 
EZK.23.49	And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I 
EZK.24.1	Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth 
EZK.24.2	 Son of man, write thee the name of the day, 
EZK.24.3	And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.4	gather the pieces thereof into it, 
EZK.24.5	Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, 
EZK.24.6	Wherefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.7	For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; 
EZK.24.8	that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered. 
EZK.24.9	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.10	Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. 
EZK.24.11	Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and 
EZK.24.12	She hath wearied 
EZK.24.13	In thy filthiness 
EZK.24.14	I the 
EZK.24.15	Also the word of the 
EZK.24.16	Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. 
EZK.24.17	Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not 
EZK.24.18	So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
EZK.24.19	And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these 
EZK.24.20	Then I answered them, The word of the 
EZK.24.21	Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.24.22	And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover 
EZK.24.23	And your tires 
EZK.24.24	Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I 
EZK.24.25	Also, thou son of man, 
EZK.24.26	 he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause 
EZK.24.27	In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I 
EZK.25.2	Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them; 
EZK.25.3	and say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.25.4	behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. 
EZK.25.5	And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I 
EZK.25.6	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.7	behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I 
EZK.25.9	therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities 
EZK.25.10	unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. 
EZK.25.11	And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I 
EZK.25.13	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.14	And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord 
EZK.25.16	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.25.17	And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I 
EZK.26.2	Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken 
EZK.26.3	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.4	And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock. 
EZK.26.5	It shall be 
EZK.26.6	And her daughters which 
EZK.26.7	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.8	He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee. 
EZK.26.9	And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers. 
EZK.26.10	By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. 
EZK.26.11	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground. 
EZK.26.12	And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water. 
EZK.26.13	 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard. 
EZK.26.14	And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be 
EZK.26.15	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.16	 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at 
EZK.26.17	And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, 
EZK.26.18	Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that 
EZK.26.19	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.26.20	when I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living; 
EZK.26.21	 I will make thee a terror, and thou 
EZK.27.1	The word of the 
EZK.27.2	Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus; 
EZK.27.3	and say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, 
EZK.27.4	Thy borders 
EZK.27.5	They have made all thy 
EZK.27.6	 the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ash´urites have made thy benches 
EZK.27.7	Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Eli´shah was that which covered thee. 
EZK.27.8	The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise 
EZK.27.9	The ancients of Gebal and the wise 
EZK.27.10	They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness. 
EZK.27.11	The men of Arvad with thine army 
EZK.27.12	Tarshish 
EZK.27.13	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they 
EZK.27.14	They of the house of Togar´mah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules. 
EZK.27.15	The men of Dedan 
EZK.27.16	Syria 
EZK.27.17	Judah, and the land of Israel, they 
EZK.27.18	Damascus 
EZK.27.19	Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market. 
EZK.27.20	Dedan 
EZK.27.21	Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these 
EZK.27.22	The merchants of Sheba and Ra´amah, they 
EZK.27.23	Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, 
EZK.27.24	These 
EZK.27.26	Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas. 
EZK.27.27	Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that 
EZK.27.28	The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. 
EZK.27.29	And all that handle the oar, the mariners, 
EZK.27.30	and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes: 
EZK.27.31	and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart 
EZK.27.32	And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, 
EZK.27.33	When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. 
EZK.27.34	In the time 
EZK.27.35	All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in 
EZK.27.36	The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never 
EZK.28.1	The word of the 
EZK.28.2	Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.3	behold, thou 
EZK.28.4	with thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: 
EZK.28.5	by thy great wisdom 
EZK.28.6	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.7	behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. 
EZK.28.8	They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of 
EZK.28.9	Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I 
EZK.28.10	Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken 
EZK.28.11	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.28.12	Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.13	Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone 
EZK.28.14	Thou 
EZK.28.15	Thou 
EZK.28.16	By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 
EZK.28.17	Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. 
EZK.28.18	Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. 
EZK.28.19	All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never 
EZK.28.21	Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, 
EZK.28.22	and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.23	For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I 
EZK.28.24	And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor 
EZK.28.25	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.28.26	And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I 
EZK.29.2	Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt: 
EZK.29.3	speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.4	But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales. 
EZK.29.5	And I will leave thee 
EZK.29.6	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I 
EZK.29.7	When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand. 
EZK.29.8	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.9	And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I 
EZK.29.9	Because he hath said, The river 
EZK.29.10	behold, therefore I 
EZK.29.11	No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. 
EZK.29.12	And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries 
EZK.29.13	Yet thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.14	and I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return 
EZK.29.15	It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. 
EZK.29.16	And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth 
EZK.29.17	And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first 
EZK.29.18	Son of man, Nebuchadrez´zar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head 
EZK.29.19	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.29.20	I have given him the land of Egypt 
EZK.29.21	In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I 
EZK.30.1	The word of the 
EZK.30.2	Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.3	For the day 
EZK.30.4	And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down. 
EZK.30.5	Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
EZK.30.6	Thus saith the 
EZK.30.7	And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries 
EZK.30.8	And they shall know that I 
EZK.30.9	In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.
EZK.30.10	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.11	He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain. 
EZK.30.12	And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the 
EZK.30.13	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.14	And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zo´an, and will execute judgments in No. 
EZK.30.15	And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No. 
EZK.30.16	And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph 
EZK.30.17	The young men of Aven and of Pi–be´seth shall fall by the sword: and these 
EZK.30.18	At Tehaph´nehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. 
EZK.30.19	Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I 
EZK.30.20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first 
EZK.30.21	Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword. 
EZK.30.22	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.30.23	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. 
EZK.30.24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded 
EZK.30.25	But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I 
EZK.30.26	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I 
EZK.31.1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third 
EZK.31.2	Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness? 
EZK.31.3	Behold, the Assyrian 
EZK.31.4	The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field. 
EZK.31.5	Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth. 
EZK.31.6	All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. 
EZK.31.7	Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters. 
EZK.31.8	 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; not any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty. 
EZK.31.9	I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches; so that all the trees of Eden, that 
EZK.31.10	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.31.11	I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness. 
EZK.31.12	And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him. 
EZK.31.13	Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: 
EZK.31.14	to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
EZK.31.15	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.31.16	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell
EZK.31.17	They also went down into hell
EZK.31.18	To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with 
EZK.31.18	This 
EZK.32.1	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first 
EZK.32.2	Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou 
EZK.32.3	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.32.4	Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee. 
EZK.32.5	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. 
EZK.32.6	I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, 
EZK.32.7	 And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. 
EZK.32.8	All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.9	I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known. 
EZK.32.10	Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at 
EZK.32.11	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.32.12	By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. 
EZK.32.13	I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. 
EZK.32.14	Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord 
EZK.32.15	When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I 
EZK.32.16	This 
EZK.32.17	It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth 
EZK.32.18	Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, 
EZK.32.19	Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. 
EZK.32.20	They shall fall in the midst of 
EZK.32.21	The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell
EZK.32.22	Asshur 
EZK.32.23	whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.
EZK.32.24	There 
EZK.32.25	They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves 
EZK.32.26	There 
EZK.32.27	And they shall not lie with the mighty 
EZK.32.28	Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with 
EZK.32.29	There 
EZK.32.30	There 
EZK.32.31	Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, 
EZK.32.32	For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with 
EZK.33.1	Again the word of the 
EZK.33.2	Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: 
EZK.33.3	if when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; 
EZK.33.4	then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. 
EZK.33.5	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. 
EZK.33.6	But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take 
EZK.33.7	So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. 
EZK.33.8	When I say unto the wicked, O wicked 
EZK.33.9	Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
EZK.33.10	Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins 
EZK.33.11	Say unto them, 
EZK.33.12	Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his 
EZK.33.13	When I shall say to the righteous, 
EZK.33.14	Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; 
EZK.33.15	 the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
EZK.33.16	None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
EZK.33.17	Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. 
EZK.33.18	When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. 
EZK.33.19	But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby. 
EZK.33.20	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
EZK.33.22	Now the hand of the 
EZK.33.23	Then the word of the 
EZK.33.24	Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we 
EZK.33.25	Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.33.26	Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor's wife: and shall ye possess the land? 
EZK.33.27	Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.33.28	For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through. 
EZK.33.29	Then shall they know that I 
EZK.33.30	Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the 
EZK.33.31	And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee 
EZK.33.32	And, lo, thou 
EZK.33.33	And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.
EZK.34.1	And the word of the 
EZK.34.2	Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.3	Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: 
EZK.34.4	The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up 
EZK.34.5	 And they were scattered, because 
EZK.34.6	My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek 
EZK.34.7	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.8	 I live, saith the Lord 
EZK.34.9	therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.10	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.11	For thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.12	As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep 
EZK.34.13	And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country. 
EZK.34.14	I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and 
EZK.34.15	I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord 
EZK.34.16	I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up 
EZK.34.17	And 
EZK.34.18	 a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? 
EZK.34.19	And 
EZK.34.20	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.34.21	Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; 
EZK.34.22	therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle. 
EZK.34.23	 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, 
EZK.34.24	 And I the 
EZK.34.25	And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. 
EZK.34.26	And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing. 
EZK.34.27	And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I 
EZK.34.28	And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make 
EZK.34.29	And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more. 
EZK.34.30	Thus shall they know that I the 
EZK.34.31	And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, 
EZK.35.2	Son of man, set thy face against mount Se´ir, and prophesy against it, 
EZK.35.3	and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.35.4	I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I 
EZK.35.5	Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed 
EZK.35.6	therefore, 
EZK.35.7	Thus will I make mount Se´ir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth. 
EZK.35.8	And I will fill his mountains with his slain 
EZK.35.9	I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I 
EZK.35.10	Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the 
EZK.35.11	therefore, 
EZK.35.12	And thou shalt know that I 
EZK.35.13	Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard 
EZK.35.14	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.35.15	As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Se´ir, and all Idume´a, 
EZK.36.1	Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the 
EZK.36.2	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.3	therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.4	therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.36.5	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.6	Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.7	therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.8	But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come. 
EZK.36.9	For, behold, I 
EZK.36.10	and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, 
EZK.36.11	and I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better 
EZK.36.12	Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, 
EZK.36.13	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.14	therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord 
EZK.36.15	Neither will I cause 
EZK.36.16	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.36.17	Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman. 
EZK.36.18	Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols 
EZK.36.19	and I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them. 
EZK.36.20	And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These 
EZK.36.21	But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.
EZK.36.22	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.23	And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I 
EZK.36.24	For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. 
EZK.36.25	Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. 
EZK.36.26	 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. 
EZK.36.27	And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do 
EZK.36.28	And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
EZK.36.29	I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. 
EZK.36.30	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen. 
EZK.36.31	Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that 
EZK.36.32	Not for your sakes do I 
EZK.36.33	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.34	And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. 
EZK.36.35	And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities 
EZK.36.36	Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the 
EZK.36.37	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.36.38	As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I 
EZK.37.1	The hand of the 
EZK.37.2	and caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, 
EZK.37.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord 
EZK.37.4	Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the 
EZK.37.5	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.6	and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I 
EZK.37.7	So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. 
EZK.37.8	And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but 
EZK.37.9	Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.10	 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
EZK.37.11	Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts. 
EZK.37.12	Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.13	And ye shall know that I 
EZK.37.14	and shall put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the 
EZK.37.15	The word of the 
EZK.37.16	Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of E´phra-im, and 
EZK.37.17	and join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. 
EZK.37.18	And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou 
EZK.37.19	Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.20	And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. 
EZK.37.21	And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.37.22	and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all: 
EZK.37.23	neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
EZK.37.25	And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, 
EZK.37.26	Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. 
EZK.37.27	 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
EZK.37.28	And the heathen shall know that I the 
EZK.38.1	And the word of the 
EZK.38.2	 Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 
EZK.38.3	and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.4	and I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts 
EZK.38.5	Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet: 
EZK.38.6	Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togar´mah of the north quarters, and all his bands: 
EZK.38.7	Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them. 
EZK.38.8	After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land 
EZK.38.9	Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.
EZK.38.10	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.11	and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates, 
EZK.38.12	to take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places 
EZK.38.13	Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?
EZK.38.14	Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.15	And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army: 
EZK.38.16	and thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
EZK.38.17	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.38.18	And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord 
EZK.38.19	For in my jealousy 
EZK.38.20	so that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that 
EZK.38.21	And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord 
EZK.38.22	And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that 
EZK.38.23	Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I 
EZK.39.1	Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.39.2	and I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel: 
EZK.39.3	and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand. 
EZK.39.4	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that 
EZK.39.5	Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken 
EZK.39.6	And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I 
EZK.39.7	So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not 
EZK.39.8	Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.9	And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years: 
EZK.39.10	so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down 
EZK.39.11	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
EZK.39.12	And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land. 
EZK.39.13	Yea, all the people of the land shall bury 
EZK.39.14	And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land, to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search. 
EZK.39.15	And the passengers 
EZK.39.16	And also the name of the city 
EZK.39.18	Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan. 
EZK.39.19	And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you. 
EZK.39.20	Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord 
EZK.39.21	And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them. 
EZK.39.22	So the house of Israel shall know that I 
EZK.39.23	And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies; so fell they all by the sword. 
EZK.39.24	According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.
EZK.39.25	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
EZK.39.26	after that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made 
EZK.39.27	When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations; 
EZK.39.28	then shall they know that I 
EZK.39.29	Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord 
EZK.40.1	In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth 
EZK.40.2	 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which 
EZK.40.3	 And he brought me thither, and, behold, 
EZK.40.4	And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall show thee; for to the intent that I might show 
EZK.40.6	Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, 
EZK.40.7	And 
EZK.40.8	He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed. 
EZK.40.9	Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate 
EZK.40.10	And the little chambers of the gate eastward 
EZK.40.11	And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; 
EZK.40.12	The space also before the little chambers 
EZK.40.13	He measured then the gate from the roof of 
EZK.40.14	He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate. 
EZK.40.15	And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate 
EZK.40.16	And 
EZK.40.17	Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, 
EZK.40.18	And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates 
EZK.40.19	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits eastward and northward.
EZK.40.20	And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof. 
EZK.40.21	And the little chambers thereof 
EZK.40.22	And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, 
EZK.40.23	And the gate of the inner court 
EZK.40.24	After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures. 
EZK.40.25	And 
EZK.40.26	And 
EZK.40.27	And 
EZK.40.28	And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures; 
EZK.40.29	and the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and 
EZK.40.30	And the arches round about 
EZK.40.31	And the arches thereof 
EZK.40.32	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures. 
EZK.40.33	And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, 
EZK.40.34	And the arches thereof 
EZK.40.35	And he brought me to the north gate, and measured 
EZK.40.36	the little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length 
EZK.40.37	And the posts thereof 
EZK.40.38	And the chambers and the entries thereof 
EZK.40.39	And in the porch of the gate 
EZK.40.40	And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, 
EZK.40.41	Four tables 
EZK.40.42	And the four tables 
EZK.40.43	And within 
EZK.40.44	And without the inner gate 
EZK.40.45	And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect 
EZK.40.46	And the chamber whose prospect 
EZK.40.47	So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar 
EZK.40.48	And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured 
EZK.40.49	The length of the porch 
EZK.41.1	Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, 
EZK.41.2	And the breadth of the door 
EZK.41.3	Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. 
EZK.41.4	So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This 
EZK.41.5	After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of 
EZK.41.6	And the side chambers 
EZK.41.7	And 
EZK.41.8	I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers 
EZK.41.9	The thickness of the wall, which 
EZK.41.10	And between the chambers 
EZK.41.11	And the doors of the side chambers 
EZK.41.12	Now the building that 
EZK.41.13	So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long; 
EZK.41.14	also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.
EZK.41.15	And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which 
EZK.41.16	the doorposts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, ceiled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows 
EZK.41.17	to that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure. 
EZK.41.18	And 
EZK.41.19	so that the face of a man 
EZK.41.20	From the ground unto above the door 
EZK.41.21	The posts of the temple 
EZK.41.22	The altar of wood 
EZK.41.23	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
EZK.41.24	And the doors had two leaves 
EZK.41.25	And 
EZK.41.26	And 
EZK.42.1	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that 
EZK.42.2	Before the length of a hundred cubits 
EZK.42.3	Over against the twenty 
EZK.42.4	And before the chambers 
EZK.42.5	Now the upper chambers 
EZK.42.6	For they 
EZK.42.7	And the wall that 
EZK.42.8	For the length of the chambers that 
EZK.42.9	And from under these chambers 
EZK.42.10	The chambers 
EZK.42.11	And the way before them 
EZK.42.12	And according to the doors of the chambers that 
EZK.42.13	Then said he unto me, The north chambers 
EZK.42.14	When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy 
EZK.42.15	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect 
EZK.42.16	He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
EZK.42.17	He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
EZK.42.18	He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. 
EZK.42.19	He turned about to the west side, 
EZK.42.20	He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred 
EZK.43.1	Afterward he brought me to the gate, 
EZK.43.2	 and, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice 
EZK.43.3	And 
EZK.43.4	And the glory of the 
EZK.43.5	So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.43.6	And I heard 
EZK.43.7	And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, 
EZK.43.8	In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. 
EZK.43.9	Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcasses of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
EZK.43.10	Thou son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern. 
EZK.43.11	And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write 
EZK.43.12	This 
EZK.43.14	And from the bottom 
EZK.43.15	So the altar 
EZK.43.16	And the altar 
EZK.43.17	And the settle 
EZK.43.19	And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord 
EZK.43.20	And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put 
EZK.43.21	Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. 
EZK.43.22	And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse 
EZK.43.23	When thou hast made an end of cleansing 
EZK.43.24	And thou shalt offer them before the 
EZK.43.25	Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat 
EZK.43.26	Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves. 
EZK.43.27	And when these days are expired, it shall be, 
EZK.44.1	Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it 
EZK.44.2	Then said the 
EZK.44.3	 for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the 
EZK.44.4	Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.44.5	And the 
EZK.44.6	And thou shalt say to the rebellious, 
EZK.44.7	in that ye have brought 
EZK.44.8	And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
EZK.44.9	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.44.10	And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity. 
EZK.44.11	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, 
EZK.44.12	Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.13	And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy 
EZK.44.14	But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
EZK.44.15	But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.16	they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge. 
EZK.44.17	 And it shall come to pass, 
EZK.44.18	They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird 
EZK.44.19	 And when they go forth into the outer court, 
EZK.44.20	 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads. 
EZK.44.21	 Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. 
EZK.44.22	 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before. 
EZK.44.23	 And they shall teach my people 
EZK.44.24	And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; 
EZK.44.25	 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. 
EZK.44.26	And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. 
EZK.44.27	And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord 
EZK.44.29	 They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs. 
EZK.44.30	And the first of all the firstfruits of all 
EZK.44.31	 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.
EZK.45.1	Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the 
EZK.45.2	Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred 
EZK.45.3	And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary 
EZK.45.4	The holy 
EZK.45.5	And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.
EZK.45.6	And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy 
EZK.45.7	And 
EZK.45.8	In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and 
EZK.45.9	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.45.11	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer. 
EZK.45.12	And the shekel 
EZK.45.13	This 
EZK.45.14	concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, 
EZK.45.15	and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord 
EZK.45.16	All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel. 
EZK.45.17	And it shall be the prince's part 
EZK.45.18	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.45.19	and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put 
EZK.45.20	And so thou shalt do the seventh 
EZK.45.22	And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock 
EZK.45.23	And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the 
EZK.45.24	And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil for an ephah. 
EZK.45.25	 In the seventh 
EZK.46.1	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.46.2	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of 
EZK.46.3	Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the 
EZK.46.4	And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the 
EZK.46.5	And the meat offering 
EZK.46.6	And in the day of the new moon 
EZK.46.7	And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 
EZK.46.8	And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of 
EZK.46.9	But when the people of the land shall come before the 
EZK.46.10	And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.
EZK.46.11	And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 
EZK.46.12	Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the 
EZK.46.13	Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the 
EZK.46.14	And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the 
EZK.46.15	Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning 
EZK.46.16	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.46.17	 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after, it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them. 
EZK.46.18	Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; 
EZK.46.19	After he brought me through the entry, which 
EZK.46.20	Then said he unto me, This 
EZK.46.21	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court 
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the court 
EZK.46.23	And 
EZK.46.24	Then said he unto me, These 
EZK.47.2	Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the outer gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
EZK.47.3	And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters 
EZK.47.4	Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters 
EZK.47.5	Afterward he measured a thousand; 
EZK.47.6	And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen 
EZK.47.6	Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river. 
EZK.47.7	Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river 
EZK.47.8	Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: 
EZK.47.9	And it shall come to pass, 
EZK.47.10	And it shall come to pass, 
EZK.47.11	But the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt. 
EZK.47.12	And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.
EZK.47.13	Thus saith the Lord 
EZK.47.14	And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: 
EZK.47.15	And this 
EZK.47.16	Hamath, Ber´othah, Sibra´im, which 
EZK.47.17	And the border from the sea shall be Ha´zar–e´nan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And 
EZK.47.18	And the east side ye shall measure from Hau´ran, and from Damascus, and from Gil´e-ad, and from the land of Israel 
EZK.47.19	And the south side southward, from Tamar 
EZK.47.20	The west side also 
EZK.47.21	So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	And it shall come to pass, 
EZK.47.23	And it shall come to pass, 
EZK.48.1	Now these 
EZK.48.2	And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a 
EZK.48.3	And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, a 
EZK.48.4	And by the border of Naph´tali, from the east side unto the west side, a 
EZK.48.5	And by the border of Manas´seh, from the east side unto the west side, a 
EZK.48.6	And by the border of E´phra-im, from the east side even unto the west side, a 
EZK.48.7	And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a 
EZK.48.8	And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand 
EZK.48.9	The oblation that ye shall offer unto the 
EZK.48.10	And for them, 
EZK.48.11	 for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. 
EZK.48.12	And 
EZK.48.13	And over against the border of the priests, the Levites 
EZK.48.14	And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for 
EZK.48.15	And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane 
EZK.48.16	And these 
EZK.48.17	And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. 
EZK.48.18	And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy 
EZK.48.19	And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.48.20	All the oblation 
EZK.48.21	And the residue 
EZK.48.22	Moreover, from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city,

DAN.1.2	 And the Lord gave Jehoi´akim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. 
DAN.1.3	And the king spake unto Ash´penaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring 
DAN.1.4	children in whom 
DAN.1.5	And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. 
DAN.1.6	Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hanani´ah, Mish´a-el, and Azari´ah: 
DAN.1.7	unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel 
DAN.1.8	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 
DAN.1.9	Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. 
DAN.1.10	And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which 
DAN.1.11	Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hanani´ah, Mish´a-el, and Azari´ah, 
DAN.1.12	Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. 
DAN.1.14	So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. 
DAN.1.15	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. 
DAN.1.16	Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.
DAN.1.17	As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. 
DAN.1.18	Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnez´zar. 
DAN.1.19	And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hanani´ah, Mish´a-el, and Azari´ah: therefore stood they before the king. 
DAN.1.20	And in all matters of wisdom 
DAN.1.21	And Daniel continued 
DAN.2.1	And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnez´zar, Nebuchadnez´zar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. 
DAN.2.2	Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chalde´ans, for to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. 
DAN.2.3	And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. 
DAN.2.4	Then spake the Chalde´ans to the king in Syriac,
DAN.2.5	The king answered and said to the Chalde´ans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. 
DAN.2.6	But if ye show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. 
DAN.2.7	They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it. 
DAN.2.8	The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. 
DAN.2.9	But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, 
DAN.2.10	The Chalde´ans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter: therefore 
DAN.2.11	And 
DAN.2.12	For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise 
DAN.2.13	And the decree went forth that the wise 
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Ar´i-och the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise 
DAN.2.15	he answered and said to Ar´i-och the king's captain, Why 
DAN.2.16	Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hanani´ah, Mish´a-el, and Azari´ah, his companions: 
DAN.2.18	that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise 
DAN.2.19	Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
DAN.2.20	Daniel answered and said,
DAN.2.20	Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever:
DAN.2.20	for wisdom and might are his:
DAN.2.21	and he changeth the times and the seasons:
DAN.2.21	he removeth kings, and setteth up kings:
DAN.2.21	he giveth wisdom unto the wise,
DAN.2.21	and knowledge to them that know understanding:
DAN.2.22	he revealeth the deep and secret things:
DAN.2.22	he knoweth what 
DAN.2.22	and the light dwelleth with him.
DAN.2.23	I thank thee, and praise thee,
DAN.2.23	O thou God of my fathers,
DAN.2.23	who hast given me wisdom and might,
DAN.2.23	and hast made known unto me now
DAN.2.23	what we desired of thee:
DAN.2.23	for thou hast 
DAN.2.23	the king's matter.
DAN.2.24	Therefore Daniel went in unto Ar´i-och, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise 
DAN.2.25	Then Ar´i-och brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation. 
DAN.2.26	The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name 
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise 
DAN.2.28	but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnez´zar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; 
DAN.2.29	As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came 
DAN.2.30	But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for 
DAN.2.31	Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness 
DAN.2.32	This image's head 
DAN.2.33	his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. 
DAN.2.34	Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet 
DAN.2.35	Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	This 
DAN.2.37	Thou, O king, 
DAN.2.38	And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou 
DAN.2.39	And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. 
DAN.2.40	And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all 
DAN.2.41	And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. 
DAN.2.42	And 
DAN.2.43	And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. 
DAN.2.44	And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, 
DAN.2.45	Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream 
DAN.2.46	Then the king Nebuchadnez´zar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him. 
DAN.2.47	The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth 
DAN.2.48	Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise 
DAN.2.49	Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed´nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel 
DAN.3.1	Nebuchadnez´zar the king made an image of gold, whose height 
DAN.3.2	Then Nebuchadnez´zar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnez´zar the king had set up. 
DAN.3.3	Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnez´zar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnez´zar had set up. 
DAN.3.4	Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, 
DAN.3.5	 at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnez´zar the king hath set up: 
DAN.3.6	and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
DAN.3.7	Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down 
DAN.3.8	Wherefore at that time certain Chalde´ans came near, and accused the Jews. 
DAN.3.9	They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnez´zar, O king, live for ever. 
DAN.3.10	Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image: 
DAN.3.11	and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, 
DAN.3.12	There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed´nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnez´zar in 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnez´zar spake and said unto them, 
DAN.3.15	Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; 
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed´nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnez´zar, we 
DAN.3.17	If it be 
DAN.3.18	But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
DAN.3.19	Then was Nebuchadnez´zar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed´nego: 
DAN.3.20	And he commanded the most mighty men that 
DAN.3.21	Then these men were bound in their coats, their hose, and their hats, and their 
DAN.3.22	Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed´nego. 
DAN.3.23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed´nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.24	Then Nebuchadnez´zar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, 
DAN.3.25	He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnez´zar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, 
DAN.3.27	And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them. 
DAN.3.28	 Nebuchadnez´zar spake, and said, Blessed 
DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed´nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort. 
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed´nego, in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	Nebuchadnez´zar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. 
DAN.4.2	I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. 
DAN.4.3	How great 
DAN.4.4	I Nebuchadnez´zar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace: 
DAN.4.5	I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 
DAN.4.6	Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise 
DAN.4.7	Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chalde´ans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. 
DAN.4.8	But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name 
DAN.4.9	O Belteshaz´zar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods 
DAN.4.10	Thus 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: 
DAN.4.12	the leaves thereof 
DAN.4.13	I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven; 
DAN.4.14	he cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches: 
DAN.4.15	nevertheless, leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and 
DAN.4.16	let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. 
DAN.4.17	This matter 
DAN.4.18	This dream I king Nebuchadnez´zar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshaz´zar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise 
DAN.4.19	Then Daniel, whose name 
DAN.4.20	The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; 
DAN.4.21	whose leaves 
DAN.4.22	it 
DAN.4.23	And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and 
DAN.4.24	this 
DAN.4.25	that they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. 
DAN.4.26	And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. 
DAN.4.27	Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
DAN.4.28	All this came upon the king Nebuchadnez´zar. 
DAN.4.29	At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. 
DAN.4.30	The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty? 
DAN.4.31	While the word 
DAN.4.32	And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling 
DAN.4.33	The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnez´zar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' 
DAN.4.34	And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnez´zar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever, whose dominion 
DAN.4.35	and all the inhabitants of the earth 
DAN.4.36	At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honor and brightness returned unto me; and my counselors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. 
DAN.4.37	Now I Nebuchadnez´zar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works 
DAN.5.1	Belshaz´zar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
DAN.5.2	Belshaz´zar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnez´zar had taken out of the temple which 
DAN.5.3	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which 
DAN.5.4	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
DAN.5.5	In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. 
DAN.5.6	Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. 
DAN.5.7	The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chalde´ans, and the soothsayers. 
DAN.5.8	Then came in all the king's wise 
DAN.5.9	Then was king Belshaz´zar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonished.
DAN.5.11	there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom 
DAN.5.12	forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshaz´zar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.
DAN.5.13	Then was Daniel brought in before the king. 
DAN.5.14	I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods 
DAN.5.15	And now the wise 
DAN.5.16	and I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and 
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king and make known to him the interpretation. 
DAN.5.18	O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnez´zar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honor: 
DAN.5.19	and for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down. 
DAN.5.20	But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: 
DAN.5.21	and he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling 
DAN.5.22	And thou his son, O Belshaz´zar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this; 
DAN.5.23	but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath 
DAN.5.24	Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written. 
DAN.5.25	And this 
DAN.5.26	This 
DAN.5.27	; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. 
DAN.5.28	; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
DAN.5.29	Then commanded Belshaz´zar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and 
DAN.5.30	In that night was Belshaz´zar the king of the Chalde´ans slain. 
DAN.5.31	And Dari´us the Me´di-an took the kingdom, 
DAN.6.1	It pleased Dari´us to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; 
DAN.6.2	and over these three presidents; of whom Daniel 
DAN.6.3	Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit 
DAN.6.4	Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he 
DAN.6.5	Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find 
DAN.6.6	Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Dari´us, live for ever. 
DAN.6.7	All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counselors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. 
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
DAN.6.9	Wherefore king Dari´us signed the writing and the decree.
DAN.6.10	Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and, his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. 
DAN.6.11	Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. 
DAN.6.12	Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask 
DAN.6.13	Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which 
DAN.6.14	Then the king, when he heard 
DAN.6.15	Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians 
DAN.6.16	Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast 
DAN.6.17	And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. 
DAN.6.18	Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.
DAN.6.19	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. 
DAN.6.20	And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: 
DAN.6.21	Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. 
DAN.6.22	My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. 
DAN.6.23	Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God. 
DAN.6.24	And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast 
DAN.6.25	Then king Dari´us wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. 
DAN.6.26	I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he 
DAN.6.27	He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
DAN.6.28	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Dari´us, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshaz´zar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, 
DAN.7.2	Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. 
DAN.7.3	 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. 
DAN.7.4	 The first 
DAN.7.5	And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and 
DAN.7.6	After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. 
DAN.7.7	 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it 
DAN.7.8	 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn 
DAN.7.10	 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. 
DAN.7.11	I beheld then, because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld 
DAN.7.12	As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
DAN.7.14	 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion 
DAN.7.15	I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of 
DAN.7.16	I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. 
DAN.7.17	These great beasts, which are four, 
DAN.7.18	 But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
DAN.7.19	Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth 
DAN.7.20	and of the ten horns that 
DAN.7.21	 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; 
DAN.7.22	 until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. 
DAN.7.24	 And the ten horns out of this kingdom 
DAN.7.25	 And he shall speak 
DAN.7.26	But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy 
DAN.7.27	 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom 
DAN.7.28	Hitherto 
DAN.8.1	In the third year of the reign of king Belshaz´zar a vision appeared unto me, 
DAN.8.2	And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I 
DAN.8.3	Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had 
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither 
DAN.8.5	And as I was considering, behold, a he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat 
DAN.8.6	And he came to the ram that had 
DAN.8.7	And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
DAN.8.8	Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
DAN.8.9	And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant 
DAN.8.10	 And it waxed great, 
DAN.8.11	Yea, he magnified 
DAN.8.12	And a host was given 
DAN.8.13	Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain 
DAN.8.14	And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
DAN.8.15	And it came to pass, when I, 
DAN.8.16	 And I heard a man's voice between 
DAN.8.17	So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end 
DAN.8.18	Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. 
DAN.8.19	And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end 
DAN.8.20	The ram which thou sawest having 
DAN.8.21	And the rough goat 
DAN.8.22	Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. 
DAN.8.23	And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. 
DAN.8.24	And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. 
DAN.8.25	And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify 
DAN.8.26	And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told 
DAN.8.27	And I Daniel fainted, and was sick 
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Dari´us the son of Ahasue´rus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chalde´ans; 
DAN.9.2	 in the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the 
DAN.9.3	And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: 
DAN.9.4	and I prayed unto the 
DAN.9.5	we have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments: 
DAN.9.6	neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 
DAN.9.7	O Lord, righteousness 
DAN.9.8	O Lord, to us 
DAN.9.9	To the Lord our God 
DAN.9.10	neither have we obeyed the voice of the 
DAN.9.11	Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that 
DAN.9.12	And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. 
DAN.9.13	As 
DAN.9.14	Therefore hath the 
DAN.9.15	And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. 
DAN.9.16	O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people 
DAN.9.17	Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. 
DAN.9.18	O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. 
DAN.9.19	O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
DAN.9.20	And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the 
DAN.9.21	 yea, while I 
DAN.9.22	And he informed 
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show 
DAN.9.24	Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy. 
DAN.9.25	Know therefore and understand, 
DAN.9.26	And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof 
DAN.9.27	 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make 
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshaz´zar; and the thing 
DAN.10.2	In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. 
DAN.10.4	And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which 
DAN.10.5	 then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins 
DAN.10.6	his body also 
DAN.10.7	And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves. 
DAN.10.8	Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. 
DAN.10.9	Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.
DAN.10.10	And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and 
DAN.10.11	And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. 
DAN.10.12	Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. 
DAN.10.13	 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. 
DAN.10.14	Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision 
DAN.10.15	And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb. 
DAN.10.16	And, behold, 
DAN.10.17	For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
DAN.10.18	Then there came again and touched me 
DAN.10.19	and said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace 
DAN.10.20	Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Gre´cia shall come. 
DAN.10.21	 But I will show thee that which is noted in the Scripture of truth: and 
DAN.11.1	Also I in the first year of Dari´us the Mede, 
DAN.11.2	And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than 
DAN.11.3	And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. 
DAN.11.4	And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides those.
DAN.11.5	And the king of the south shall be strong, and 
DAN.11.6	And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in 
DAN.11.7	But out of a branch of her roots shall 
DAN.11.8	and shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, 
DAN.11.9	So the king of the south shall come into 
DAN.11.10	But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and 
DAN.11.11	And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, 
DAN.11.12	 when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down 
DAN.11.13	For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
DAN.11.14	And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall. 
DAN.11.15	So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither 
DAN.11.16	But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed. 
DAN.11.17	He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand 
DAN.11.18	After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause 
DAN.11.19	Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
DAN.11.20	Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes 
DAN.11.21	And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. 
DAN.11.22	And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. 
DAN.11.23	And after the league 
DAN.11.24	He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do 
DAN.11.25	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him. 
DAN.11.26	Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain. 
DAN.11.27	And both these kings' hearts 
DAN.11.28	Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart 
DAN.11.29	At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter. 
DAN.11.30	For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant. 
DAN.11.31	 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily 
DAN.11.32	And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do 
DAN.11.33	And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, 
DAN.11.34	Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. 
DAN.11.35	And 
DAN.11.37	Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all. 
DAN.11.38	But in his estate shall he honor the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things. 
DAN.11.39	Thus shall he do in the most strongholds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge 
DAN.11.40	And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over. 
DAN.11.41	He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many 
DAN.11.42	He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape. 
DAN.11.43	But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians 
DAN.11.44	But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many. 
DAN.11.45	And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
DAN.12.2	 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame 
DAN.12.3	And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever. 
DAN.12.4	 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, 
DAN.12.5	Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. 
DAN.12.6	And 
DAN.12.7	 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which 
DAN.12.8	And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what 
DAN.12.9	And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words 
DAN.12.10	 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand. 
DAN.12.11	 And from the time 
DAN.12.12	Blessed 
DAN.12.13	But go thou thy way till the end 
HOS.1.2	The beginning of the word of the 
HOS.1.3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Dibla´im; which conceived, and bare him a son.
HOS.1.5	And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
HOS.1.6	And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And 
HOS.1.7	But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the 
HOS.1.8	Now when she had weaned Lo–ruha´mah, she conceived, and bare a son. 
HOS.1.9	Then said 
HOS.1.11	Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great 
HOS.2.1	Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi;
HOS.2.2	Plead with your mother, plead; for she 
HOS.2.3	lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst. 
HOS.2.4	And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they 
HOS.2.5	For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give 
HOS.2.6	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy ways with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. 
HOS.2.7	And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find 
HOS.2.8	For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, 
HOS.2.9	Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax 
HOS.2.10	And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. 
HOS.2.11	I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts. 
HOS.2.12	And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These 
HOS.2.13	And I will visit upon her the days of Ba´alim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the 
HOS.2.14	Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. 
HOS.2.15	 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
HOS.2.16	And it shall be at that day, saith the 
HOS.2.17	For I will take away the names of Ba´alim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name. 
HOS.2.18	And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and 
HOS.2.19	And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies. 
HOS.2.20	I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the 
HOS.2.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the 
HOS.2.22	and the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel. 
HOS.2.23	 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to 
HOS.3.1	Then said the 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her to me for fifteen 
HOS.3.3	and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for 
HOS.3.4	For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and 
HOS.3.5	afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the 
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of the 
HOS.4.2	By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. 
HOS.4.3	Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
HOS.4.4	Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people 
HOS.4.5	Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother. 
HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
HOS.4.7	As they were increased, so they sinned against me: 
HOS.4.8	They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. 
HOS.4.9	And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. 
HOS.4.10	For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the 
HOS.4.11	Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. 
HOS.4.12	My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused 
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof 
HOS.4.13	Therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery. 
HOS.4.14	I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people 
HOS.4.15	Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, 
HOS.4.16	For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the 
HOS.4.17	E´phra-im 
HOS.4.18	Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers 
HOS.4.19	The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
HOS.5.1	Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment 
HOS.5.2	And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I 
HOS.5.3	I know E´phra-im, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O E´phra-im, thou committest whoredom, 
HOS.5.4	They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms 
HOS.5.5	And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and E´phra-im fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. 
HOS.5.6	They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the 
HOS.5.7	They have dealt treacherously against the 
HOS.5.8	Blow ye the cornet in Gib´e-ah, 
HOS.5.9	E´phra-im shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. 
HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: 
HOS.5.11	E´phra-im 
HOS.5.12	Therefore 
HOS.5.13	When E´phra-im saw his sickness, and Judah 
HOS.5.14	For I 
HOS.5.15	I will go 
HOS.6.1	Come, and let us return unto the 
HOS.6.2	 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. 
HOS.6.3	Then shall we know, 
HOS.6.4	O E´phra-im, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness 
HOS.6.5	Therefore have I hewed 
HOS.6.6	 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
HOS.6.7	But they like men
HOS.6.8	Gil´e-ad 
HOS.6.9	And as troops of robbers wait for a man, 
HOS.6.10	I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: there 
HOS.6.11	Also, O Judah, he hath set a harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
HOS.7.1	When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of E´phra-im was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, 
HOS.7.2	And they consider not in their hearts 
HOS.7.3	They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. 
HOS.7.4	They 
HOS.7.5	In the day of our king, the princes have made 
HOS.7.6	For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. 
HOS.7.7	They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: 
HOS.7.8	E´phra-im, he hath mixed himself among the people; E´phra-im is a cake not turned. 
HOS.7.9	Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth 
HOS.7.10	And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the 
HOS.7.11	E´phra-im also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. 
HOS.7.12	When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. 
HOS.7.13	Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
HOS.7.14	And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, 
HOS.7.15	Though I have bound 
HOS.7.16	They return, 
HOS.8.2	Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee. 
HOS.8.3	Israel hath cast off 
HOS.8.4	They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew 
HOS.8.5	Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast 
HOS.8.6	For from Israel 
HOS.8.7	For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. 
HOS.8.8	Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein 
HOS.8.9	For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: E´phra-im hath hired lovers. 
HOS.8.10	Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.
HOS.8.11	Because E´phra-im hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin. 
HOS.8.12	I have written to him the great things of my law, 
HOS.8.13	They sacrifice flesh 
HOS.8.14	For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
HOS.9.1	Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as 
HOS.9.2	The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her. 
HOS.9.3	They shall not dwell in the

HOS.9.5	What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the 
HOS.9.6	For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant 
HOS.9.8	The watchman of E´phra-im 
HOS.9.9	 They have deeply corrupted 
HOS.9.11	 E´phra-im, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception. 
HOS.9.12	Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, 
HOS.9.13	E´phra-im, as I saw Tyrus, 
HOS.9.14	Give them, O 
HOS.9.15	All their wickedness 
HOS.9.16	E´phra-im is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay 
HOS.9.17	My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
HOS.10.1	Israel 
HOS.10.2	Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.
HOS.10.3	For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the 
HOS.10.4	They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. 
HOS.10.5	 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth–a´ven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof 
HOS.10.6	It shall be also carried unto Assyria 
HOS.10.7	 Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water. 
HOS.10.8	 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
HOS.10.10	 in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows. 
HOS.10.11	And E´phra-im 
HOS.10.13	Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. 
HOS.10.14	Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth–ar´bel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon 
HOS.10.15	So shall Beth–el do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.
HOS.11.2	 they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Ba´alim, and burned incense to graven images. 
HOS.11.3	I taught E´phra-im also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. 
HOS.11.4	I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.
HOS.11.5	He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. 
HOS.11.6	And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour 
HOS.11.7	And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the Most High, none at all would exalt 
HOS.11.9	I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy E´phra-im: for I 
HOS.11.10	They shall walk after the 
HOS.11.11	They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the 
HOS.11.12	E´phra-im compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.
HOS.12.1	E´phra-im feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.
HOS.12.2	The 
HOS.12.3	 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God: 
HOS.12.4	 yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him 
HOS.12.5	even the 
HOS.12.6	Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.
HOS.12.8	And E´phra-im said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: 
HOS.12.9	 And I 
HOS.12.10	I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets. 
HOS.12.11	 iniquity 
HOS.12.12	 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept 
HOS.12.13	 And by a prophet the 
HOS.12.14	E´phra-im provoked 
HOS.13.1	When E´phra-im spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Ba´al, he died. 
HOS.13.2	And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, 
HOS.13.3	Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff 
HOS.13.4	Yet I 
HOS.13.5	 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. 
HOS.13.6	According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me. 
HOS.13.7	Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe 
HOS.13.8	I will meet them as a bear 
HOS.13.9	O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me 
HOS.13.10	 I will be thy king: where 
HOS.13.11	 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took 
HOS.13.12	The iniquity of E´phra-im 
HOS.13.13	The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he 
HOS.13.14	 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.
HOS.13.15	Though he be fruitful among 
HOS.13.16	Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.
HOS.14.1	O Israel, return unto the 
HOS.14.2	Take with you words, and turn to the 
HOS.14.3	Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, 
HOS.14.4	I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 
HOS.14.5	I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. 
HOS.14.6	His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. 
HOS.14.7	They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive

HOS.14.9	Who 
JOL.1.1	The word of the 
JOL.1.2	Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? 
JOL.1.3	Tell ye your children of it, and 
JOL.1.4	That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.
JOL.1.5	Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. 
JOL.1.6	 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth 
JOL.1.7	He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast 
JOL.1.8	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. 
JOL.1.9	The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the 
JOL.1.10	The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. 
JOL.1.11	Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. 
JOL.1.12	The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, 
JOL.1.13	Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. 
JOL.1.14	Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders 
JOL.1.16	Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, 
JOL.1.17	The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. 
JOL.1.18	How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. 
JOL.1.19	O 
JOL.1.20	The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
JOL.2.1	Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the 
JOL.2.2	a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, 
JOL.2.3	A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land 
JOL.2.5	Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array. 
JOL.2.6	Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness. 
JOL.2.7	They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks: 
JOL.2.8	neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and 
JOL.2.9	They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief. 
JOL.2.10	 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining: 
JOL.2.11	 and the 
JOL.2.12	Therefore also now, saith the 
JOL.2.13	and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the 
JOL.2.14	Who knoweth 
JOL.2.15	Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly: 
JOL.2.16	gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. 
JOL.2.17	Let the priests, the ministers of the

JOL.2.20	but I will remove far off from you the northern 
JOL.2.21	Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the 
JOL.2.22	Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength. 
JOL.2.23	Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the 
JOL.2.24	And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. 
JOL.2.25	And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you. 
JOL.2.26	And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the 
JOL.2.27	And ye shall know that I 
JOL.2.29	and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.
JOL.2.30	And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. 
JOL.2.31	 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the 
JOL.2.32	 And it shall come to pass, 
JOL.3.1	For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 
JOL.3.2	I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehosh´aphat, and will plead with them there for my people and 
JOL.3.3	And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.
JOL.3.5	because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: 
JOL.3.6	the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. 
JOL.3.7	Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own head: 
JOL.3.8	and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabe´ans, to a people far off: for the 
JOL.3.9	Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: 
JOL.3.10	 beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak say, I 
JOL.3.11	Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O 
JOL.3.12	Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehosh´aphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about. 
JOL.3.13	 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness 
JOL.3.14	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the 
JOL.3.15	The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
JOL.3.17	So shall ye know that I 
JOL.3.18	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
JOL.3.19	Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence 
JOL.3.20	But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. 
JOL.3.21	For I will cleanse their blood 
AMO.1.4	but I will send a fire into the house of Haz´a-el, which shall devour the palaces of Ben–ha´dad. 
AMO.1.5	I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden:
AMO.1.7	but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof: 
AMO.1.8	and I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ash´kelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord 
AMO.1.10	but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.
AMO.1.12	but I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
AMO.1.14	but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind: 
AMO.1.15	and their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the 
AMO.2.2	but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kir´i-oth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, 
AMO.2.3	and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the 
AMO.2.4	Thus saith the 
AMO.2.5	but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
AMO.2.6	Thus saith the 
AMO.2.7	that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the 
AMO.2.8	and they lay 
AMO.2.10	Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. 
AMO.2.11	 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. 
AMO.2.12	But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
AMO.2.13	Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed 
AMO.2.14	Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself: 
AMO.2.15	neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and 
AMO.2.16	And 
AMO.3.1	Hear this word that the 
AMO.3.2	You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
AMO.3.3	Can two walk together, except they be agreed? 
AMO.3.4	Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing? 
AMO.3.5	Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin 
AMO.3.6	Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the 
AMO.3.7	Surely the Lord 
AMO.3.8	The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord 
AMO.3.9	Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof. 
AMO.3.10	For they know not to do right, saith the 
AMO.3.11	Therefore thus saith the Lord 
AMO.3.12	Thus saith the 
AMO.3.13	Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord 
AMO.3.14	 That, in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Beth–el: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground. 
AMO.3.15	And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the 
AMO.4.1	Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that 
AMO.4.2	The Lord 
AMO.4.3	And ye shall go out at the breaches, every 
AMO.4.4	Come to Beth–el, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, 
AMO.4.5	and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim 
AMO.4.6	And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.7	And also I have withholden the rain from you, when 
AMO.4.8	So two 
AMO.4.9	I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured 
AMO.4.10	I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the 
AMO.4.11	 I have overthrown 
AMO.4.12	Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: 
AMO.4.13	For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what 
AMO.5.1	Hear ye this word which I take up against you, 
AMO.5.2	The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; 
AMO.5.3	For thus saith the Lord 
AMO.5.4	For thus saith the 
AMO.5.5	but seek not Beth–el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer–sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth–el shall come to nought. 
AMO.5.6	Seek the 
AMO.5.7	Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth, 
AMO.5.9	that strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
AMO.5.10	They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. 
AMO.5.11	Forasmuch therefore as your treading 
AMO.5.12	For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate 
AMO.5.13	Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it 
AMO.5.14	Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the 
AMO.5.15	Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the 
AMO.5.16	Therefore the 
AMO.5.17	And in all vineyards 
AMO.5.18	Woe unto you that desire the day of the 
AMO.5.19	As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. 
AMO.5.20	 not the day of the 
AMO.5.22	Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept 
AMO.5.23	Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. 
AMO.5.24	But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
AMO.5.26	But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch
AMO.5.27	Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the 
AMO.6.1	Woe to them 
AMO.6.2	Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: 
AMO.6.3	Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near; 
AMO.6.4	that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; 
AMO.6.5	that chant to the sound of the viol, 
AMO.6.6	that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
AMO.6.7	Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed. 
AMO.6.8	The Lord 
AMO.6.9	And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die. 
AMO.6.10	And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that 
AMO.6.11	For, behold, the 
AMO.6.12	Shall horses run upon the rock? will 
AMO.6.13	ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength? 
AMO.6.14	But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the 
AMO.7.1	Thus hath the Lord 
AMO.7.2	And it came to pass, 
AMO.7.3	The 
AMO.7.4	Thus hath the Lord 
AMO.7.5	Then said I, O Lord 
AMO.7.6	The 
AMO.7.7	Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall 
AMO.7.8	And the 
AMO.7.9	and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jerobo´am with the sword.
AMO.7.10	Then Amazi´ah the priest of Beth–el sent to Jerobo´am king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. 
AMO.7.11	For thus Amos saith, Jerobo´am shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land. 
AMO.7.12	Also Amazi´ah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: 
AMO.7.13	but prophesy not again any more at Beth–el: for it 
AMO.7.14	Then answered Amos, and said to Amazi´ah, I 
AMO.7.15	and the 
AMO.7.16	Now therefore hear thou the word of the 
AMO.7.17	Therefore thus saith the 
AMO.8.1	Thus hath the Lord 
AMO.8.2	And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the 
AMO.8.3	And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord 
AMO.8.4	Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail, 
AMO.8.5	saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit? 
AMO.8.6	That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; 
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.8	Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as 
AMO.8.9	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord 
AMO.8.10	and I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only 
AMO.8.11	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord 
AMO.8.12	and they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the 
AMO.8.13	In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. 
AMO.8.14	They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beer–sheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.
AMO.9.2	Though they dig into hell,
AMO.9.3	and though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them: 
AMO.9.4	and though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
AMO.9.5	And the Lord 
AMO.9.6	 he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The 
AMO.9.8	Behold, the eyes of the Lord 
AMO.9.9	For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as 
AMO.9.10	All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.
AMO.9.12	that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the 
AMO.9.13	Behold, the days come, saith the 
AMO.9.14	And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit 
AMO.9.15	And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the 
OBA.1.1	Thus saith the Lord 
OBA.1.2	Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised. 
OBA.1.3	The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation 
OBA.1.4	Though thou exalt 
OBA.1.5	If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grape gatherers came to thee, would they not leave 
OBA.1.6	How are 
OBA.1.7	All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee 
OBA.1.8	Shall I not in that day, saith the 
OBA.1.9	And thy mighty 
OBA.1.10	For 
OBA.1.11	In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou 
OBA.1.12	But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress. 
OBA.1.13	Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid 
OBA.1.14	neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.
OBA.1.15	For the day of the 
OBA.1.16	For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, 
OBA.1.17	But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. 
OBA.1.18	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be 
OBA.1.19	And 
OBA.1.20	And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel 
OBA.1.21	And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the 
JON.1.2	Arise, go to Nin´eveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me. 
JON.1.3	But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the 
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that 
JON.1.6	So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.
JON.1.7	And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil 
JON.1.8	Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil 
JON.1.9	And he said unto them, I 
JON.1.10	Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the 
JON.1.11	Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous. 
JON.1.12	And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest 
JON.1.13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring 
JON.1.14	Wherefore they cried unto the 
JON.1.15	So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging. 
JON.1.16	Then the men feared the 
JON.2.1	Then Jonah prayed unto the 
JON.2.2	and said,
JON.2.2	I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the 
JON.2.2	and he heard me;
JON.2.2	out of the belly of hell
JON.2.3	For thou hadst cast me into the deep,
JON.2.3	in the midst of the seas;
JON.2.3	and the floods compassed me about:
JON.2.3	all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
JON.2.4	Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight;
JON.2.4	yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
JON.2.5	The waters compassed me about,
JON.2.5	the depth closed me round about,
JON.2.5	the weeds were wrapped about my head.
JON.2.6	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains;
JON.2.6	the earth with her bars 
JON.2.6	yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption,
JON.2.6	O 
JON.2.7	When my soul fainted within me
JON.2.7	I remembered the 
JON.2.7	and my prayer came in unto thee,
JON.2.7	into thine holy temple.
JON.2.8	They that observe lying vanities
JON.2.8	forsake their own mercy.
JON.2.9	But I will sacrifice unto thee
JON.2.9	with the voice of thanksgiving;
JON.2.9	I will pay 
JON.2.9	Salvation 
JON.2.10	And the 
JON.3.1	And the word of the 
JON.3.2	Arise, go unto Nin´eveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. 
JON.3.3	So Jonah arose, and went unto Nin´eveh, according to the word of the 
JON.3.4	 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nin´eveh shall be overthrown. 
JON.3.5	So the people of Nin´eveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
JON.3.6	For word came unto the king of Nin´eveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered 
JON.3.7	And he caused 
JON.3.8	but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that 
JON.3.9	Who can tell 
JON.3.10	And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did 
JON.4.1	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. 
JON.4.2	 And he prayed unto the 
JON.4.3	Therefore now, O 
JON.4.4	Then said the 
JON.4.5	So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.
JON.4.6	And the 
JON.4.7	But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. 
JON.4.8	And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, 
JON.4.9	And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, 
JON.4.10	Then said the 
JON.4.11	and should not I spare Nin´eveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and 
MIC.1.2	Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord 
MIC.1.3	For, behold, the 
MIC.1.4	And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, 
MIC.1.5	For the transgression of Jacob 
MIC.1.6	Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, 
MIC.1.7	And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered 
MIC.1.8	Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls. 
MIC.1.9	For her wound 
MIC.1.10	Declare ye 
MIC.1.11	Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Za´anan came not forth in the mourning of Beth–e´zel; he shall receive of you his standing. 
MIC.1.12	For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the 
MIC.1.13	O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she 
MIC.1.14	Therefore shalt thou give presents to Mo´resheth–gath: the houses of Achzib
MIC.1.15	Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mare´shah: he shall come unto Adul´lam the glory of Israel. 
MIC.1.16	Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
MIC.2.1	Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. 
MIC.2.2	And they covet fields, and take 
MIC.2.3	Therefore thus saith the 
MIC.2.4	In that day shall 
MIC.2.5	Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the 
MIC.2.6	Prophesy ye not, 
MIC.2.7	O 
MIC.2.8	Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war. 
MIC.2.9	The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. 
MIC.2.10	Arise ye, and depart; for this 
MIC.2.11	If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, 
MIC.2.12	I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of 
MIC.2.13	The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it; and their king shall pass before them, and the 
MIC.3.1	And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; 
MIC.3.2	Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; 
MIC.3.3	who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. 
MIC.3.4	Then shall they cry unto the 
MIC.3.5	Thus saith the 
MIC.3.6	Therefore night 
MIC.3.7	Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for 
MIC.3.8	But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the 
MIC.3.9	Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. 
MIC.3.10	They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. 
MIC.3.11	The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the 
MIC.3.12	 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed 
MIC.4.1	But in the last days it shall come to pass, 
MIC.4.2	And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
MIC.4.3	 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 
MIC.4.4	 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make 
MIC.4.5	For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the 
MIC.4.6	In that day, saith the 
MIC.4.7	and I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the 
MIC.4.8	And thou, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.
MIC.4.9	Now why dost thou cry out aloud? 
MIC.4.10	 Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go 
MIC.4.11	Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. 
MIC.4.12	But they know not the thoughts of the 
MIC.4.13	Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the 
MIC.5.1	Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
MIC.5.3	Therefore will he give them up, until the time 
MIC.5.4	And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the 
MIC.5.5	And this 
MIC.5.6	 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver 
MIC.5.7	And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the 
MIC.5.8	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. 
MIC.5.9	Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
MIC.5.10	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
MIC.5.11	and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strongholds: 
MIC.5.12	and I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no 
MIC.5.13	thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. 
MIC.5.14	And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities. 
MIC.5.15	And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.
MIC.6.1	Hear ye now what the 
MIC.6.2	Hear ye, O mountains, the 
MIC.6.3	O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. 
MIC.6.4	 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 
MIC.6.5	 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Ba´laam the son of Be´or answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the 
MIC.6.6	Wherewith shall I come before the 
MIC.6.7	Will the 
MIC.6.8	He hath showed thee, O man, what 
MIC.6.9	The 
MIC.6.10	Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure 
MIC.6.11	Shall I count 
MIC.6.12	For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue 
MIC.6.13	Therefore also will I make 
MIC.6.14	Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down 
MIC.6.15	Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine. 
MIC.6.16	 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
MIC.7.1	Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: 
MIC.7.2	The good 
MIC.7.3	That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge 
MIC.7.4	The best of them 
MIC.7.5	Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. 
MIC.7.6	 For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies 
MIC.7.7	Therefore I will look unto the 
MIC.7.8	Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the 
MIC.7.9	I will bear the indignation of the 
MIC.7.10	Then 
MIC.7.12	 that day 
MIC.7.13	Notwithstanding, the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
MIC.7.14	Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily 
MIC.7.15	According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I show unto him marvelous 
MIC.7.16	The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay 
MIC.7.17	They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the 
MIC.7.18	Who 
MIC.7.19	He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. 
MIC.7.20	Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, 
NAM.1.2	God 
NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.4	He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth. 
NAM.1.5	The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
NAM.1.6	Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. 
NAM.1.7	The 
NAM.1.8	But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies. 
NAM.1.9	What do ye imagine against the 
NAM.1.10	For while 
NAM.1.11	There is 
NAM.1.12	Thus saith the 
NAM.1.13	For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder. 
NAM.1.14	And the 
NAM.2.1	He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make 
NAM.2.2	For the 
NAM.2.3	The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men 
NAM.2.4	The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings. 
NAM.2.5	He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defense shall be prepared. 
NAM.2.6	The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved. 
NAM.2.7	And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead 
NAM.2.8	But Nin´eveh 
NAM.2.9	Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for 
NAM.2.10	She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain 
NAM.2.11	Where 
NAM.2.12	The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.
NAM.2.13	Behold, I 
NAM.3.1	Woe to the bloody city! it 
NAM.3.2	the noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the prancing horses, and of the jumping chariots. 
NAM.3.3	The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and 
NAM.3.4	because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well-favored harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.
NAM.3.5	Behold, I 
NAM.3.6	And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock. 
NAM.3.7	And it shall come to pass, 
NAM.3.8	Art thou better than populous No,
NAM.3.9	Ethiopia and Egypt 
NAM.3.10	Yet 
NAM.3.11	Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy. 
NAM.3.12	All thy strongholds 
NAM.3.13	Behold, thy people in the midst of thee 
NAM.3.14	Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strongholds: go into clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brickkiln. 
NAM.3.15	There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts. 
NAM.3.16	Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away. 
NAM.3.17	Thy crowned 
NAM.3.18	Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell 
NAM.3.19	 no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
HAB.1.1	The burden which Habak´kuk the prophet did see.
HAB.1.2	O 
HAB.1.3	Why dost thou show me iniquity, and cause 
HAB.1.4	Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.
HAB.1.6	 For, lo, I raise up the Chalde´ans, 
HAB.1.7	They 
HAB.1.8	Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle 
HAB.1.9	They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up 
HAB.1.10	And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every stronghold; for they shall heap dust, and take it. 
HAB.1.11	Then shall 
HAB.1.13	 of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, 
HAB.1.14	and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, 
HAB.1.15	They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. 
HAB.1.16	Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion 
HAB.1.17	Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
HAB.2.1	I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved. 
HAB.2.2	And the 
HAB.2.3	 For the vision 
HAB.2.4	 Behold, his soul 
HAB.2.5	Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, 
HAB.2.6	Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth 
HAB.2.7	Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them? 
HAB.2.8	Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and 
HAB.2.9	Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil! 
HAB.2.10	Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned 
HAB.2.11	For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
HAB.2.12	Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity! 
HAB.2.13	Behold, 
HAB.2.14	 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the 
HAB.2.15	Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, that puttest thy bottle to 
HAB.2.16	Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the 
HAB.2.17	For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, 
HAB.2.18	What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? 
HAB.2.19	Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it 
HAB.2.20	But the 
HAB.3.1	A prayer of Habak´kuk the prophet upon Shigi-o´noth.
HAB.3.2	O 
HAB.3.2	O 
HAB.3.2	in the midst of the years make known;
HAB.3.2	in wrath remember mercy.
HAB.3.3	God came from Teman,
HAB.3.3	and the Holy One from mount Paran. 
HAB.3.3	His glory covered the heavens,
HAB.3.3	and the earth was full of his praise.
HAB.3.4	And 
HAB.3.4	he had horns 
HAB.3.4	and there 
HAB.3.5	Before him went the pestilence,
HAB.3.5	and burning coals went forth at his feet.
HAB.3.6	He stood, and measured the earth:
HAB.3.6	he beheld, and drove asunder the nations;
HAB.3.6	and the everlasting mountains were scattered,
HAB.3.6	the perpetual hills did bow:
HAB.3.6	his ways 
HAB.3.7	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:
HAB.3.8	Was the 
HAB.3.8	that thou didst ride upon thine horses 
HAB.3.9	Thy bow was made quite naked,
HAB.3.9	Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains saw thee, 
HAB.3.10	the overflowing of the water passed by:
HAB.3.10	the deep uttered his voice,
HAB.3.11	The sun 
HAB.3.11	at the light of thine arrows they went,
HAB.3.12	Thou didst march through the land in indignation,
HAB.3.12	thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.
HAB.3.13	Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,
HAB.3.13	thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked,
HAB.3.13	by discovering the foundation unto the neck. 
HAB.3.14	Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages:
HAB.3.14	they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me:
HAB.3.14	their rejoicing 
HAB.3.15	Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses,
HAB.3.16	When I heard, my belly trembled;
HAB.3.16	my lips quivered at the voice:
HAB.3.16	rottenness entered into my bones,
HAB.3.16	and I trembled in myself,
HAB.3.16	that I might rest in the day of trouble:
HAB.3.16	when he cometh up unto the people,
HAB.3.16	he will invade them with his troops.
HAB.3.17	Although the fig tree shall not blossom,
HAB.3.17	neither 
HAB.3.17	the labor of the olive shall fail,
HAB.3.17	and the fields shall yield no meat;
HAB.3.17	the flock shall be cut off from the fold,
HAB.3.17	and 
HAB.3.18	yet I will rejoice in the 
HAB.3.18	I will joy in the God of my salvation.
HAB.3.19	and he will make my feet like hinds' 
HAB.3.19	and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.
HAB.3.19	To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
ZEP.1.2	I will utterly consume all 
ZEP.1.3	I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the 
ZEP.1.4	I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Ba´al from this place, 
ZEP.1.5	and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship 
ZEP.1.6	and them that are turned back from the 
ZEP.1.7	Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord 
ZEP.1.8	And it shall come to pass in the day of the 
ZEP.1.9	In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.
ZEP.1.10	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
ZEP.1.11	Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off. 
ZEP.1.12	And it shall come to pass at that time, 
ZEP.1.13	Therefore, their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit 
ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.15	That day 
ZEP.1.16	a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.
ZEP.1.17	And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the 
ZEP.1.18	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the 
ZEP.2.1	Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired; 
ZEP.2.2	before the decree bring forth, 
ZEP.2.3	Seek ye the 
ZEP.2.4	 For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ash´kelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
ZEP.2.5	Woe unto the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Cher´ethites! the word of the 
ZEP.2.6	And the seacoast shall be dwellings 
ZEP.2.7	And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ash´kelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the 
ZEP.2.9	 Therefore, 
ZEP.2.10	This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.13	 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nin´eveh a desolation, 
ZEP.2.14	And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; 
ZEP.2.15	This 
ZEP.3.1	Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city! 
ZEP.3.2	She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the 
ZEP.3.3	Her princes within her 
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets 
ZEP.3.5	The just 
ZEP.3.6	I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. 
ZEP.3.7	I said, Surely, thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, 
ZEP.3.8	Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the 
ZEP.3.9	For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the 
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, 
ZEP.3.11	In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. 
ZEP.3.12	I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the 
ZEP.3.13	 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make 
ZEP.3.14	Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. 
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.16	In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: 
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.18	I will gather 
ZEP.3.19	Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. 
ZEP.3.20	At that time will I bring you 
HAG.1.2	Thus speaketh the 
HAG.1.3	Then came the word of the 
HAG.1.4	 time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house 
HAG.1.5	Now therefore thus saith the 
HAG.1.6	Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages 
HAG.1.7	Thus saith the 
HAG.1.8	Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the 
HAG.1.9	Ye looked for much, and, lo, 
HAG.1.10	Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed 
HAG.1.11	And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon 
HAG.1.12	Then Zerub´babel the son of She-al´ti-el, and Joshua the son of Jos´edech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the 
HAG.1.13	Then spake Hag´gai the 
HAG.1.14	And the 
HAG.1.15	in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Dari´us the king.
HAG.2.1	In the seventh 
HAG.2.2	Speak now to Zerub´babel the son of She-al´ti-el, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jos´edech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying, 
HAG.2.3	 Who 
HAG.2.4	Yet now be strong, O Zerub´babel, saith the 
HAG.2.6	 For thus saith the 
HAG.2.7	and I will shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the 
HAG.2.8	The silver 
HAG.2.9	The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the 
HAG.2.10	In the four and twentieth 
HAG.2.11	Thus saith the 
HAG.2.12	If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No. 
HAG.2.13	 Then said Hag´gai, If 
HAG.2.14	Then answered Hag´gai, and said, So 
HAG.2.15	And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the 
HAG.2.16	since those 
HAG.2.17	I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labors of your hands; yet ye 
HAG.2.18	Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth 
HAG.2.19	Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless 
HAG.2.20	And again the word of the 
HAG.2.21	Speak to Zerub´babel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth; 
HAG.2.22	and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. 
HAG.2.23	In that day, saith the 
ZEC.1.2	The 
ZEC.1.3	Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.4	Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.5	Your fathers, where 
ZEC.1.6	But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the 
ZEC.1.7	Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which 
ZEC.1.8	 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that 
ZEC.1.9	Then said I, O my lord, what 
ZEC.1.10	And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These 
ZEC.1.11	And they answered the angel of the 
ZEC.1.12	Then the angel of the 
ZEC.1.13	And the 
ZEC.1.14	So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.15	And I am very sore displeased with the heathen 
ZEC.1.16	Therefore thus saith the 
ZEC.1.17	Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.18	Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. 
ZEC.1.19	And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What 
ZEC.1.20	And the 
ZEC.1.21	Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These 
ZEC.2.1	I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
ZEC.2.2	Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what 
ZEC.2.3	And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 
ZEC.2.4	and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited 
ZEC.2.5	For I, saith the 
ZEC.2.6	Ho, ho, 
ZEC.2.7	Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest 
ZEC.2.8	For thus saith the 
ZEC.2.9	For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the 
ZEC.2.10	Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the 
ZEC.2.11	And many nations shall be joined to the 
ZEC.2.12	And the 
ZEC.2.13	Be silent, O all flesh, before the 
ZEC.3.2	 And the 
ZEC.3.3	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 
ZEC.3.4	And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from the thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. 
ZEC.3.5	And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the 
ZEC.3.6	And the angel of the 
ZEC.3.7	Thus saith the 
ZEC.3.8	 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they 
ZEC.3.9	For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone 
ZEC.3.10	 In that day, saith the 
ZEC.4.1	And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, 
ZEC.4.2	and said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all 
ZEC.4.3	 and two olive trees by it, one upon the right 
ZEC.4.4	So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What 
ZEC.4.5	Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
ZEC.4.6	 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This 
ZEC.4.7	Who 
ZEC.4.8	Moreover the word of the 
ZEC.4.9	The hands of Zerub´babel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the 
ZEC.4.10	 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerub´babel 
ZEC.4.12	And I answered again, and said unto him, What 
ZEC.4.13	And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these 
ZEC.4.14	Then said he, These 
ZEC.5.1	Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll. 
ZEC.5.2	And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof 
ZEC.5.3	Then said he unto me, This 
ZEC.5.4	I will bring it forth, saith the 
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what 
ZEC.5.6	And I said, What 
ZEC.5.7	And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this 
ZEC.5.8	And he said, This 
ZEC.5.9	Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind 
ZEC.5.10	Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 
ZEC.5.11	And he said unto me, To build it a house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.
ZEC.6.1	And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains 
ZEC.6.2	 In the first chariot 
ZEC.6.3	 and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled and bay horses. 
ZEC.6.4	Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What 
ZEC.6.5	 And the angel answered and said unto me, These 
ZEC.6.6	The black horses which 
ZEC.6.7	And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
ZEC.6.8	Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
ZEC.6.9	And the word of the 
ZEC.6.10	Take of 
ZEC.6.11	then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set 
ZEC.6.12	 and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the 
ZEC.6.13	even he shall build the temple of the 
ZEC.6.14	And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobi´jah, and to Jedai´ah, and to Hen the son of Zephani´ah, for a memorial in the temple of the 
ZEC.6.15	And they 
ZEC.7.1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Dari´us, 
ZEC.7.2	when they had sent unto the house of God Shere´zer and Re´gem–me´lech, and their men, to pray before the 
ZEC.7.3	 to speak unto the priests which 
ZEC.7.4	Then came the word of the 
ZEC.7.5	Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh 
ZEC.7.6	And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat 
ZEC.7.7	 not 
ZEC.7.8	And the word of the 
ZEC.7.9	Thus speaketh the 
ZEC.7.10	and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. 
ZEC.7.11	But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. 
ZEC.7.12	Yea, they made their hearts 
ZEC.7.13	Therefore it is come to pass, 
ZEC.7.14	but I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
ZEC.8.1	Again the word of the 
ZEC.8.2	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.3	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.4	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.5	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. 
ZEC.8.6	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.7	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.8	and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
ZEC.8.9	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.10	For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither 
ZEC.8.11	But now I 
ZEC.8.12	For the seed 
ZEC.8.13	And it shall come to pass, 
ZEC.8.14	For thus saith the 
ZEC.8.15	so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. 
ZEC.8.16	 These 
ZEC.8.17	and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these 
ZEC.8.18	And the word of the 
ZEC.8.19	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.20	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.21	and the inhabitants of one 
ZEC.8.22	Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the 
ZEC.8.23	Thus saith the 
ZEC.9.2	And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise. 
ZEC.9.3	And Tyrus did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. 
ZEC.9.4	Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.
ZEC.9.6	And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 
ZEC.9.7	And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, 
ZEC.9.8	And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.
ZEC.9.10	 And I will cut off the chariot from E´phra-im, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion 
ZEC.9.11	As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein 
ZEC.9.12	Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even today do I declare 
ZEC.9.13	when I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with E´phra-im, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.
ZEC.9.14	And the 
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.16	And the 
ZEC.9.17	For how great 
ZEC.10.1	Ask ye of the 
ZEC.10.2	 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because 
ZEC.10.3	Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the 
ZEC.10.4	Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together. 
ZEC.10.5	And they shall be as mighty 
ZEC.10.6	And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I 
ZEC.10.7	And 
ZEC.10.8	I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. 
ZEC.10.9	And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again. 
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gil´e-ad and Lebanon; and 
ZEC.10.11	And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away. 
ZEC.10.12	And I will strengthen them in the 
ZEC.11.1	Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. 
ZEC.11.2	Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down. 
ZEC.11.3	 a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.
ZEC.11.4	Thus saith the 
ZEC.11.5	whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed 
ZEC.11.6	For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the 
ZEC.11.7	And I will feed the flock of slaughter, 
ZEC.11.8	Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me. 
ZEC.11.9	Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. 
ZEC.11.10	And I took my staff, 
ZEC.11.11	And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it 
ZEC.11.12	 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give 
ZEC.11.13	And the 
ZEC.11.14	Then I cut asunder mine other staff, 
ZEC.11.15	And the 
ZEC.11.16	For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, 
ZEC.11.17	Woe to the idle shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword 
ZEC.12.1	The burden of the word of the 
ZEC.12.2	Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah 
ZEC.12.3	And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it. 
ZEC.12.4	In that day, saith the 
ZEC.12.5	And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem 
ZEC.12.6	In that day will I make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, 
ZEC.12.7	The 
ZEC.12.8	In that day shall the 
ZEC.12.9	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ZEC.12.11	In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadad–rim´mon in the valley of Megid´don. 
ZEC.12.12	And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 
ZEC.12.13	the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shim´e-i apart, and their wives apart; 
ZEC.12.14	all the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.
ZEC.13.1	In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.
ZEC.13.2	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
ZEC.13.3	And it shall come to pass, 
ZEC.13.4	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ZEC.13.5	but he shall say, I 
ZEC.13.6	And 
ZEC.13.8	And it shall come to pass, 
ZEC.13.9	And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It 
ZEC.14.1	Behold, the day the 
ZEC.14.2	For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. 
ZEC.14.3	Then shall the 
ZEC.14.4	And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which 
ZEC.14.5	And ye shall flee 
ZEC.14.6	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ZEC.14.7	but it shall be one day which shall be known to the 
ZEC.14.9	And the 
ZEC.14.10	All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and 
ZEC.14.11	 And 
ZEC.14.12	And this shall be the plague wherewith the 
ZEC.14.13	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ZEC.14.14	And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. 
ZEC.14.15	And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.
ZEC.14.17	And it shall be, 
ZEC.14.18	And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that 
ZEC.14.19	This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
ZEC.14.20	In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, 
ZEC.14.21	Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the 
MAL.1.1	The burden of the word of the 
MAL.1.3	and I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. 
MAL.1.4	Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the 
MAL.1.5	And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The 
MAL.1.6	A son honoreth 
MAL.1.7	Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the 
MAL.1.8	 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, 
MAL.1.9	And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the 
MAL.1.10	Who 
MAL.1.11	For, from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name 
MAL.1.12	But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the 
MAL.1.13	Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness 
MAL.1.14	But cursed 
MAL.2.1	And now, O ye priests, this commandment 
MAL.2.2	If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay 
MAL.2.3	Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, 
MAL.2.4	 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the 
MAL.2.5	 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him 
MAL.2.6	The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity. 
MAL.2.7	For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he 
MAL.2.8	But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the 
MAL.2.9	Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.
MAL.2.10	Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers? 
MAL.2.11	Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the 
MAL.2.12	The

MAL.2.17	Ye have wearied the

MAL.3.2	For he 
MAL.3.3	and he shall sit 
MAL.3.4	Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the 
MAL.3.5	And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in 
MAL.3.6	For I 
MAL.3.7	Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept 
MAL.3.8	Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 
MAL.3.9	Ye 
MAL.3.10	 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the 
MAL.3.11	And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the 
MAL.3.12	And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the 
MAL.3.13	Your words have been stout against me, saith the 
MAL.3.14	Ye have said, It 
MAL.3.15	And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, 
MAL.3.16	Then they that feared the

MAL.3.18	Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
MAL.4.1	For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the 
MAL.4.2	But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. 
MAL.4.3	And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do

MAT.1.1	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
MAT.1.2	Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren; 
MAT.1.3	and Judah begat Pharez and Zerah of Tamar; and Pharez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram; 
MAT.1.4	and Ram begat Ammin´adab; and Ammin´adab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon; 
MAT.1.5	and Salmon begat Boaz of Rachab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 
MAT.1.6	and Jesse begat David the king.
MAT.1.6	And David the king begat Solomon of her 
MAT.1.7	and Solomon begat Rehobo´am; and Rehobo´am begat Abi´jah; and Abi´jah begat Asa; 
MAT.1.8	and Asa begat Jehosh´aphat; and Jehosh´aphat begat Jeho´ram; and Jeho´ram begat Uzzi´ah; 
MAT.1.9	and Uzzi´ah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezeki´ah; 
MAT.1.10	and Hezeki´ah begat Manas´seh; and Manas´seh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josi´ah; 
MAT.1.11	 and Josi´ah begat Jeconi´ah and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon.
MAT.1.12	And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconi´ah begat She-al´ti-el; and She-al´ti-el begat Zerub´babel; 
MAT.1.13	and Zerub´babel begat Abi´ud; and Abi´ud begat Eli´akim; and Eli´akim begat Azor; 
MAT.1.14	and Azor begat Zadok; and Zadok begat Achim; and Achim begat Eli´ud; 
MAT.1.15	and Eli´ud begat Ele-a´zar; and Ele-a´zar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 
MAT.1.16	and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham to David 
MAT.1.19	Then Joseph her husband, being a just 
MAT.1.20	But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 
MAT.1.21	 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name 
MAT.1.22	Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
MAT.1.23	and shall bring forth a son,
MAT.1.23	and they shall call his name Imman´u-el,
MAT.1.23	which being interpreted is, God with us. 
MAT.1.24	Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 
MAT.1.25	 and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name 
MAT.2.1	Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 
MAT.2.2	saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 
MAT.2.3	When Herod the king had heard 
MAT.2.4	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. 
MAT.2.5	And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
MAT.2.6	art not the least among the princes of Judah:
MAT.2.6	for out of thee shall come a Governor,
MAT.2.6	that shall rule my people Israel.
MAT.2.7	Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. 
MAT.2.8	And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found 
MAT.2.9	When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. 
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. 
MAT.2.11	And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. 
MAT.2.12	And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
MAT.2.13	And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. 
MAT.2.14	When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: 
MAT.2.15	 and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
MAT.2.16	Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. 
MAT.2.17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
MAT.2.18	lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning,
MAT.2.18	Rachel weeping 
MAT.2.18	and would not be comforted,
MAT.2.18	because they are not.
MAT.2.19	But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
MAT.2.20	saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. 
MAT.2.21	And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 
MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archela´us did reign in Judea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: 
MAT.2.23	 and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
MAT.3.1	In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, 
MAT.3.2	 and saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
MAT.3.3	 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying,
MAT.3.3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
MAT.3.3	Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
MAT.3.3	make his paths straight.
MAT.3.5	Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, 
MAT.3.6	and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
MAT.3.8	Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: 
MAT.3.9	 and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to 
MAT.3.10	 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
MAT.3.11	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and 
MAT.3.12	whose fan 
MAT.3.13	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 
MAT.3.14	But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 
MAT.3.15	And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer 
MAT.3.16	And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 
MAT.3.17	 and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
MAT.4.2	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward ahungered. 
MAT.4.3	And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. 
MAT.4.4	 But he answered and said, It is written,
MAT.4.4	Man shall not live by bread alone,
MAT.4.4	but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
MAT.4.5	Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, 
MAT.4.6	 and saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written,
MAT.4.6	He shall give his angels charge concerning thee:
MAT.4.6	and in 
MAT.4.6	lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
MAT.4.8	Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 
MAT.4.9	and saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. 
MAT.4.10	 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written,
MAT.4.10	Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
MAT.4.10	and him only shalt thou serve.
MAT.4.11	Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
MAT.4.13	 and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Caper´na-um, which is upon the seacoast, in the borders of Zeb´ulun and Naph´tali: 
MAT.4.14	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
MAT.4.15	Galilee of the Gentiles;
MAT.4.16	the people which sat in darkness saw great light;
MAT.4.16	and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death
MAT.4.16	light is sprung up.
MAT.4.18	And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
MAT.4.19	And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. 
MAT.4.20	And they straightway left 
MAT.4.21	And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James 
MAT.4.22	And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.
MAT.4.24	And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. 
MAT.4.25	And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and 
MAT.5.1	And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: 
MAT.5.2	and he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
MAT.5.3	Blessed 
MAT.5.7	Blessed 
MAT.5.9	Blessed 
MAT.5.12	 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great 
MAT.5.15	 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 
MAT.5.16	 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
MAT.5.17	Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 
MAT.5.18	 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 
MAT.5.19	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach 
MAT.5.20	For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed 
MAT.5.22	but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause
MAT.5.23	Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee; 
MAT.5.24	leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. 
MAT.5.25	Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. 
MAT.5.26	Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
MAT.5.28	but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. 
MAT.5.29	 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast 
MAT.5.30	 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast 
MAT.5.32	 but I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.
MAT.5.34	 but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: 
MAT.5.35	 nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. 
MAT.5.36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. 
MAT.5.37	But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
MAT.5.39	but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 
MAT.5.40	And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have 
MAT.5.41	And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 
MAT.5.42	Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
MAT.5.44	But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 
MAT.5.45	that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. 
MAT.5.46	For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? 
MAT.5.47	And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more 
MAT.5.48	 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
MAT.6.2	Therefore when thou doest 
MAT.6.3	But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: 
MAT.6.4	that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
MAT.6.6	But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
MAT.6.7	But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen 
MAT.6.8	Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. 
MAT.6.9	After this manner therefore pray ye:
MAT.6.9	Our Father which art in heaven,
MAT.6.9	Hallowed be thy name.
MAT.6.10	Thy kingdom come.
MAT.6.10	Thy will be done
MAT.6.10	in earth, as 
MAT.6.11	Give us this day our daily bread.
MAT.6.12	And forgive us our debts,
MAT.6.12	as we forgive our debtors.
MAT.6.13	but deliver us from evil:
MAT.6.13	For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
MAT.6.15	but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
MAT.6.16	Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 
MAT.6.17	But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; 
MAT.6.18	that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
MAT.6.20	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: 
MAT.6.21	for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
MAT.6.22	The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. 
MAT.6.23	But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great 
MAT.6.24	No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
MAT.6.25	Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? 
MAT.6.26	Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? 
MAT.6.27	Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? 
MAT.6.28	And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 
MAT.6.29	 and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
MAT.6.30	Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, 
MAT.6.31	Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 
MAT.6.32	(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 
MAT.6.33	But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
MAT.6.34	Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day 
MAT.7.1	Judge not, that ye be not judged. 
MAT.7.2	 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. 
MAT.7.3	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 
MAT.7.4	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam 
MAT.7.5	Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.
MAT.7.6	Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
MAT.7.7	Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: 
MAT.7.8	for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 
MAT.7.9	Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? 
MAT.7.10	Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? 
MAT.7.11	If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? 
MAT.7.12	 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
MAT.7.13	Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide 
MAT.7.14	because strait 
MAT.7.15	Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 
MAT.7.16	Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? 
MAT.7.17	Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 
MAT.7.18	A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither 
MAT.7.19	 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 
MAT.7.20	 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
MAT.7.21	Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 
MAT.7.22	Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 
MAT.7.23	 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
MAT.7.24	Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 
MAT.7.25	and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. 
MAT.7.26	And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: 
MAT.7.27	and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
MAT.7.29	for he taught them as 
MAT.8.1	When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. 
MAT.8.2	And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
MAT.8.3	And Jesus put forth 
MAT.8.4	 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
MAT.8.5	And when Jesus was entered into Caper´na-um, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, 
MAT.8.6	and saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. 
MAT.8.7	And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. 
MAT.8.8	The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. 
MAT.8.9	For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this 
MAT.8.10	When Jesus heard 
MAT.8.11	 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: 
MAT.8.12	 but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
MAT.8.13	And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, 
MAT.8.14	And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever. 
MAT.8.15	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them. 
MAT.8.16	When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with 
MAT.8.17	 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare 
MAT.8.18	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side. 
MAT.8.19	And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. 
MAT.8.20	And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air 
MAT.8.21	And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 
MAT.8.22	But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.
MAT.8.23	And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. 
MAT.8.24	And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. 
MAT.8.25	And his disciples came to 
MAT.8.26	And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. 
MAT.8.27	But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
MAT.8.28	And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Ger´gesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. 
MAT.8.29	And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? 
MAT.8.30	And there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine feeding. 
MAT.8.31	So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. 
MAT.8.32	And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. 
MAT.8.33	And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils. 
MAT.8.34	And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought 
MAT.9.1	And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city. 
MAT.9.2	And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. 
MAT.9.3	And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This 
MAT.9.4	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? 
MAT.9.5	For whether is easier, to say, 
MAT.9.6	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house. 
MAT.9.7	And he arose, and departed to his house. 
MAT.9.8	But when the multitudes saw 
MAT.9.9	And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
MAT.9.11	And when the Pharisees saw 
MAT.9.12	But when Jesus heard 
MAT.9.13	 But go ye and learn what 
MAT.9.14	Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 
MAT.9.15	And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. 
MAT.9.16	No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment; for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. 
MAT.9.17	Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.
MAT.9.18	While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. 
MAT.9.19	And Jesus arose, and followed him, and 
MAT.9.20	And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind 
MAT.9.21	for she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. 
MAT.9.22	But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. 
MAT.9.23	And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, 
MAT.9.24	he said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. 
MAT.9.25	But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose. 
MAT.9.26	And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
MAT.9.27	And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, 
MAT.9.28	And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. 
MAT.9.29	Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. 
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See 
MAT.9.31	But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.
MAT.9.32	As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil. 
MAT.9.33	And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel. 
MAT.9.34	 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.
MAT.9.36	 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. 
MAT.9.37	 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly 
MAT.9.38	pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.
MAT.10.1	And when he had called unto 
MAT.10.2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James 
MAT.10.3	Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James 
MAT.10.4	Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscar´i-ot, who also betrayed him.
MAT.10.5	These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into 
MAT.10.6	but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
MAT.10.7	 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
MAT.10.8	Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. 
MAT.10.9	Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses; 
MAT.10.10	 nor scrip for 
MAT.10.11	And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. 
MAT.10.12	And when ye come into a house, salute it. 
MAT.10.13	And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. 
MAT.10.14	 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. 
MAT.10.15	 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomor´rah in the day of judgment, than for that city.
MAT.10.17	 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; 
MAT.10.18	and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against
MAT.10.19	But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. 
MAT.10.20	For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. 
MAT.10.21	 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against 
MAT.10.22	 And ye shall be hated of all 
MAT.10.23	But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
MAT.10.25	 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beel´zebub, how much more 
MAT.10.27	What I tell you in darkness, 
MAT.10.28	And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 
MAT.10.29	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. 
MAT.10.30	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 
MAT.10.31	Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows. 
MAT.10.32	Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. 
MAT.10.33	 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.
MAT.10.34	Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 
MAT.10.35	 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 
MAT.10.36	And a man's foes 
MAT.10.37	He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 
MAT.10.38	 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. 
MAT.10.39	 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
MAT.10.41	He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. 
MAT.10.42	And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold 
MAT.11.1	And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
MAT.11.2	Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, 
MAT.11.3	and said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? 
MAT.11.4	Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see: 
MAT.11.5	 the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. 
MAT.11.6	And blessed is 
MAT.11.7	And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 
MAT.11.8	But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft 
MAT.11.9	But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. 
MAT.11.10	 For this is 
MAT.11.10	Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,
MAT.11.10	which shall prepare thy way before thee.
MAT.11.11	Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
MAT.11.12	 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. 
MAT.11.13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 
MAT.11.14	 And if ye will receive 
MAT.11.15	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
MAT.11.16	But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, 
MAT.11.17	and saying,
MAT.11.17	We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced;
MAT.11.17	we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.
MAT.11.18	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. 
MAT.11.19	The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.
MAT.11.20	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: 
MAT.11.21	 Woe unto thee, Chora´zin! woe unto thee, Bethsai´da! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
MAT.11.22	But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. 
MAT.11.23	 And thou, Caper´na-um, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 
MAT.11.24	 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. 
MAT.11.26	Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. 
MAT.11.27	 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and 
MAT.11.28	Come unto me, all 
MAT.11.29	 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 
MAT.11.30	For my yoke 
MAT.12.2	But when the Pharisees saw 
MAT.12.3	 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was ahungered, and they that were with him; 
MAT.12.4	 how he entered into the house of God, and did eat the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests? 
MAT.12.5	 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? 
MAT.12.6	But I say unto you, That in this place is 
MAT.12.7	 But if ye had known what 
MAT.12.8	For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
MAT.12.9	And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: 
MAT.12.10	and, behold, there was a man which had 
MAT.12.11	 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift 
MAT.12.12	How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. 
MAT.12.13	Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched 
MAT.12.14	Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.
MAT.12.15	But when Jesus knew 
MAT.12.16	and charged them that they should not make him known: 
MAT.12.17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
MAT.12.18	my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased:
MAT.12.18	I will put my Spirit upon him,
MAT.12.18	and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.
MAT.12.19	He shall not strive, nor cry;
MAT.12.19	neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
MAT.12.20	A bruised reed shall he not break,
MAT.12.20	and smoking flax shall he not quench,
MAT.12.20	till he send forth judgment unto victory.
MAT.12.21	And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
MAT.12.22	Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. 
MAT.12.23	And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the Son of David? 
MAT.12.24	 But when the Pharisees heard 
MAT.12.25	And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: 
MAT.12.26	and if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? 
MAT.12.27	And if I by Beel´zebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast 
MAT.12.28	But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. 
MAT.12.29	Or else, how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. 
MAT.12.30	 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. 
MAT.12.31	Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy 
MAT.12.32	 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the 
MAT.12.34	 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. 
MAT.12.35	A good man out of the good treasure of the heart
MAT.12.36	But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. 
MAT.12.37	For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
MAT.12.39	 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah: 
MAT.12.40	 for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 
MAT.12.41	 The men of Nin´eveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah 
MAT.12.42	 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon 
MAT.12.43	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. 
MAT.12.44	Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth 
MAT.12.45	Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last 
MAT.12.46	While he yet talked to the people, behold, 
MAT.12.47	Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. 
MAT.12.48	But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? 
MAT.12.49	And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! 
MAT.12.50	For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
MAT.13.1	The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side. 
MAT.13.2	 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. 
MAT.13.3	And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow; 
MAT.13.4	and when he sowed, some 
MAT.13.5	some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: 
MAT.13.6	and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. 
MAT.13.7	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: 
MAT.13.8	but other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. 
MAT.13.9	Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
MAT.13.10	And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 
MAT.13.11	He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. 
MAT.13.12	 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. 
MAT.13.13	Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. 
MAT.13.14	 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith,
MAT.13.14	By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand;
MAT.13.14	and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
MAT.13.15	for this people's heart is waxed gross,
MAT.13.15	and 
MAT.13.15	and their eyes they have closed;
MAT.13.15	lest at any time they should see with 
MAT.13.15	and hear with 
MAT.13.15	and should understand with 
MAT.13.15	and should be converted, and I should heal them.
MAT.13.17	For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous 
MAT.13.18	Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 
MAT.13.19	When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth 
MAT.13.20	But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 
MAT.13.21	yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 
MAT.13.22	He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 
MAT.13.23	But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth 
MAT.13.24	Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 
MAT.13.25	but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 
MAT.13.26	But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 
MAT.13.27	So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 
MAT.13.28	He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 
MAT.13.29	But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 
MAT.13.30	Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
MAT.13.31	Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: 
MAT.13.32	which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.
MAT.13.33	Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
MAT.13.34	All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: 
MAT.13.35	 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
MAT.13.35	I will open my mouth in parables;
MAT.13.35	I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
MAT.13.36	Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 
MAT.13.37	He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 
MAT.13.38	the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 
MAT.13.39	the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 
MAT.13.40	As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 
MAT.13.41	The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 
MAT.13.42	and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 
MAT.13.43	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
MAT.13.44	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
MAT.13.45	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman, seeking goodly pearls: 
MAT.13.46	who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
MAT.13.47	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: 
MAT.13.48	which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. 
MAT.13.49	So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, 
MAT.13.50	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
MAT.13.51	Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. 
MAT.13.52	Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe 
MAT.13.53	And it came to pass, 
MAT.13.54	And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this 
MAT.13.55	Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? 
MAT.13.56	And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this 
MAT.13.57	 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house. 
MAT.13.58	And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.1	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 
MAT.14.2	and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him. 
MAT.14.3	 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put 
MAT.14.4	 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. 
MAT.14.5	And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. 
MAT.14.6	But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Hero´di-as danced before them, and pleased Herod. 
MAT.14.7	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. 
MAT.14.8	And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. 
MAT.14.9	And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded 
MAT.14.10	And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. 
MAT.14.11	And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought 
MAT.14.12	And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
MAT.14.13	When Jesus heard 
MAT.14.14	And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. 
MAT.14.15	And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. 
MAT.14.16	But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. 
MAT.14.17	And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. 
MAT.14.18	He said, Bring them hither to me. 
MAT.14.19	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to 
MAT.14.20	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. 
MAT.14.21	And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
MAT.14.22	And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. 
MAT.14.23	And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. 
MAT.14.24	But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. 
MAT.14.25	And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. 
MAT.14.26	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. 
MAT.14.27	But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
MAT.14.28	And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. 
MAT.14.29	And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. 
MAT.14.31	And immediately Jesus stretched forth 
MAT.14.32	And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. 
MAT.14.33	Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
MAT.14.34	And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennes´aret. 
MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; 
MAT.14.36	and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
MAT.15.1	Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, 
MAT.15.2	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 
MAT.15.3	But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? 
MAT.15.4	 For God commanded, saying,
MAT.15.4	Honor thy father and mother:
MAT.15.4	and,
MAT.15.4	He that curseth father or mother,
MAT.15.4	let him die the death.
MAT.15.5	But ye say, Whosoever shall say to 
MAT.15.6	and honor not his father or his mother, 
MAT.15.7	 hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
MAT.15.8	and honoreth me with 
MAT.15.8	but their heart is far from me.
MAT.15.9	But in vain they do worship me,
MAT.15.9	teaching 
MAT.15.10	And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: 
MAT.15.11	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. 
MAT.15.12	Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? 
MAT.15.13	But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. 
MAT.15.14	 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. 
MAT.15.15	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. 
MAT.15.16	And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? 
MAT.15.17	Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? 
MAT.15.18	 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. 
MAT.15.19	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 
MAT.15.20	these are 
MAT.15.21	Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. 
MAT.15.22	And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, 
MAT.15.23	But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 
MAT.15.24	But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
MAT.15.25	Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 
MAT.15.26	But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast 
MAT.15.27	And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. 
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great 
MAT.15.29	And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. 
MAT.15.30	And great multitudes came unto him, having with them 
MAT.15.31	insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
MAT.15.32	Then Jesus called his disciples 
MAT.15.33	And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? 
MAT.15.34	And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. 
MAT.15.35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 
MAT.15.36	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake 
MAT.15.37	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken 
MAT.15.38	And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. 
MAT.15.39	And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Mag´dala.
MAT.16.2	He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, 
MAT.16.3	And in the morning, 
MAT.16.4	 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them, and departed.
MAT.16.5	And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. 
MAT.16.6	 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. 
MAT.16.7	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, 
MAT.16.8	 when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? 
MAT.16.9	 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? 
MAT.16.10	 neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? 
MAT.16.11	How is it that ye do not understand that I spake 
MAT.16.12	Then understood they how that he bade 
MAT.16.13	When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesare´a Phil´ippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am? 
MAT.16.14	 And they said, Some 
MAT.16.15	He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 
MAT.16.16	 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 
MAT.16.17	And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar–jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed 
MAT.16.18	And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell
MAT.16.19	 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 
MAT.16.20	Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
MAT.16.21	From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. 
MAT.16.22	Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. 
MAT.16.23	But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offense unto me: for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.
MAT.16.25	 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. 
MAT.16.26	For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? 
MAT.16.27	 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works. 
MAT.16.28	Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
MAT.17.2	and was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. 
MAT.17.3	And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Eli´jah talking with him. 
MAT.17.4	Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Eli´jah. 
MAT.17.5	 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. 
MAT.17.6	And when the disciples heard 
MAT.17.7	And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. 
MAT.17.8	And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.
MAT.17.9	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead. 
MAT.17.10	 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Eli´jah must first come? 
MAT.17.11	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Eli´jah truly shall first come, and restore all things. 
MAT.17.12	 But I say unto you, That Eli´jah is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a 
MAT.17.15	Lord, have mercy on my son; for he is lunatic, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. 
MAT.17.16	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. 
MAT.17.17	Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. 
MAT.17.18	And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. 
MAT.17.19	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? 
MAT.17.20	 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove: and nothing shall be impossible unto you. 
MAT.17.21	Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
MAT.17.22	And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: 
MAT.17.23	and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.
MAT.17.25	He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers? 
MAT.17.26	Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free. 
MAT.17.27	Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
MAT.18.2	And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, 
MAT.18.3	 and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.18.4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.18.5	And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
MAT.18.6	But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and 
MAT.18.7	Woe unto the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh! 
MAT.18.8	 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast 
MAT.18.9	 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast 
MAT.18.10	Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. 
MAT.18.11	 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. 
MAT.18.12	How think ye? if a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? 
MAT.18.13	And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that 
MAT.18.14	Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
MAT.18.16	 But if he will not hear 
MAT.18.17	And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell 
MAT.18.18	 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 
MAT.18.19	Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. 
MAT.18.20	For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
MAT.18.22	Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
MAT.18.23	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. 
MAT.18.24	And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. 
MAT.18.25	But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. 
MAT.18.26	The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 
MAT.18.27	Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. 
MAT.18.28	But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, which owed him a hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took 
MAT.18.29	And his fellow servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 
MAT.18.30	And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. 
MAT.18.31	So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. 
MAT.18.32	Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: 
MAT.18.33	shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee? 
MAT.18.34	And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. 
MAT.18.35	So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
MAT.19.1	And it came to pass, 
MAT.19.2	and great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
MAT.19.3	The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? 
MAT.19.4	 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made 
MAT.19.5	 and said,
MAT.19.5	For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
MAT.19.5	and shall cleave to his wife:
MAT.19.5	and they twain shall be one flesh?
MAT.19.6	Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 
MAT.19.7	 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? 
MAT.19.8	He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. 
MAT.19.9	 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except 
MAT.19.10	His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with 
MAT.19.11	But he said unto them, All 
MAT.19.12	For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from 
MAT.19.13	Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put 
MAT.19.14	But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.19.15	And he laid 
MAT.19.16	And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 
MAT.19.17	And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? 
MAT.19.18	 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 
MAT.19.19	 Honor thy father and 
MAT.19.20	The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 
MAT.19.21	Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go 
MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
MAT.19.23	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.19.24	And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
MAT.19.25	When his disciples heard 
MAT.19.26	But Jesus beheld 
MAT.19.27	Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? 
MAT.19.28	 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
MAT.19.29	And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. 
MAT.19.30	 But many 
MAT.20.1	For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man 
MAT.20.2	And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 
MAT.20.3	And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the market place, 
MAT.20.4	and said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. 
MAT.20.5	Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. 
MAT.20.6	And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? 
MAT.20.7	They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, 
MAT.20.8	 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and give them 
MAT.20.9	And when they came that 
MAT.20.10	But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. 
MAT.20.11	And when they had received 
MAT.20.12	saying, These last have wrought 
MAT.20.13	But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? 
MAT.20.14	Take 
MAT.20.15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? 
MAT.20.16	 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.
MAT.20.17	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, 
MAT.20.18	Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, 
MAT.20.19	and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify 
MAT.20.20	Then came to him the mother of Zeb´edee's children with her sons, worshipping 
MAT.20.21	And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom. 
MAT.20.22	But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. 
MAT.20.23	And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but 
MAT.20.24	And when the ten heard 
MAT.20.25	 But Jesus called them 
MAT.20.26	 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; 
MAT.20.27	and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: 
MAT.20.28	even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
MAT.20.29	And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. 
MAT.20.30	And, behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, 
MAT.20.31	And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, 
MAT.20.32	And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you? 
MAT.20.33	They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. 
MAT.20.34	So Jesus had compassion 
MAT.21.1	And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, 
MAT.21.2	saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose 
MAT.21.3	And if any 
MAT.21.4	All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
MAT.21.5	Behold, thy King cometh unto thee,
MAT.21.5	meek, and sitting upon an ass,
MAT.21.5	and a colt the foal of an ass.
MAT.21.6	And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, 
MAT.21.7	and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set 
MAT.21.8	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed 
MAT.21.9	 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying,
MAT.21.9	Hosanna to the Son of David:
MAT.21.9	Blessed 
MAT.21.9	Hosanna in the highest.
MAT.21.10	And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? 
MAT.21.11	And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
MAT.21.12	And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, 
MAT.21.13	 and said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
MAT.21.14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them. 
MAT.21.15	And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased, 
MAT.21.16	 and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read,
MAT.21.16	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
MAT.21.16	thou hast perfected praise?
MAT.21.17	And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
MAT.21.18	Now in the morning, as he returned into the city, he hungered. 
MAT.21.19	And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away. 
MAT.21.20	And when the disciples saw 
MAT.21.21	 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this 
MAT.21.22	And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
MAT.21.23	And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? 
MAT.21.24	And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
MAT.21.25	The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? 
MAT.21.26	But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet. 
MAT.21.27	And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
MAT.21.28	But what think ye? A 
MAT.21.29	He answered and said, I will not; but afterward he repented, and went. 
MAT.21.30	And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I 
MAT.21.31	Whether of them twain did the will of 
MAT.21.32	 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen 
MAT.21.34	and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. 
MAT.21.35	And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. 
MAT.21.36	Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. 
MAT.21.37	But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. 
MAT.21.38	But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. 
MAT.21.39	And they caught him, and cast 
MAT.21.40	When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? 
MAT.21.41	They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out 
MAT.21.42	The stone which the builders rejected,
MAT.21.42	the same is become the head of the corner:
MAT.21.42	this is the Lord's doing,
MAT.21.42	and it is marvelous in our eyes?
MAT.21.43	Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. 
MAT.21.44	And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
MAT.21.45	And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. 
MAT.21.46	But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
MAT.22.1	And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, 
MAT.22.2	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, 
MAT.22.3	and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. 
MAT.22.4	Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and 
MAT.22.5	But they made light of 
MAT.22.6	and the remnant took his servants, and entreated 
MAT.22.7	But when the king heard 
MAT.22.8	Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. 
MAT.22.9	Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. 
MAT.22.10	So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
MAT.22.11	And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: 
MAT.22.12	and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. 
MAT.22.13	 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast 
MAT.22.14	For many are called, but few 
MAT.22.15	Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in 
MAT.22.16	And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Hero´di-ans, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any 
MAT.22.17	Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
MAT.22.18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, 
MAT.22.19	Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. 
MAT.22.20	And he saith unto them, Whose 
MAT.22.21	They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's. 
MAT.22.22	When they had heard 
MAT.22.24	 saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
MAT.22.25	Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother: 
MAT.22.26	likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. 
MAT.22.27	And last of all the woman died also. 
MAT.22.28	Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
MAT.22.29	Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. 
MAT.22.30	For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. 
MAT.22.31	But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, 
MAT.22.32	 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. 
MAT.22.33	And when the multitude heard 
MAT.22.34	But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. 
MAT.22.35	 Then one of them, 
MAT.22.36	Master, which 
MAT.22.37	 Jesus said unto him,
MAT.22.37	Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
MAT.22.37	and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
MAT.22.38	This is the first and great commandment. 
MAT.22.39	 And the second 
MAT.22.39	Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
MAT.22.40	On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
MAT.22.41	While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
MAT.22.42	saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, 
MAT.22.43	He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
MAT.22.44	Sit thou on my right hand,
MAT.22.44	till I make thine enemies thy footstool?
MAT.22.45	If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? 
MAT.22.46	And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any 
MAT.23.1	Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 
MAT.23.2	saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: 
MAT.23.3	all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, 
MAT.23.4	For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay 
MAT.23.5	 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, 
MAT.23.6	and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, 
MAT.23.7	and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. 
MAT.23.8	But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, 
MAT.23.9	And call no 
MAT.23.10	Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, 
MAT.23.11	 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. 
MAT.23.12	 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
MAT.23.13	But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in 
MAT.23.14	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. 
MAT.23.15	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
MAT.23.16	Woe unto you, 
MAT.23.17	 fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? 
MAT.23.18	And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. 
MAT.23.19	 fools and blind: for whether 
MAT.23.20	Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. 
MAT.23.21	And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein. 
MAT.23.22	 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
MAT.23.24	 blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
MAT.23.25	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. 
MAT.23.26	 blind Pharisee, cleanse first that 
MAT.23.28	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
MAT.23.29	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, 
MAT.23.30	and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. 
MAT.23.31	Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. 
MAT.23.32	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. 
MAT.23.34	Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and 
MAT.23.35	 that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zechari´ah son of Berechi´ah, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. 
MAT.23.36	Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
MAT.23.37	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, 
MAT.23.38	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. 
MAT.23.39	 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed 
MAT.24.1	And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to 
MAT.24.2	And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
MAT.24.3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what 
MAT.24.4	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 
MAT.24.5	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 
MAT.24.6	And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all 
MAT.24.7	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 
MAT.24.8	All these 
MAT.24.10	And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 
MAT.24.11	And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 
MAT.24.12	And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 
MAT.24.13	 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 
MAT.24.14	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
MAT.24.16	then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains: 
MAT.24.17	 let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: 
MAT.24.18	neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. 
MAT.24.19	And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! 
MAT.24.20	But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: 
MAT.24.21	 for then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. 
MAT.24.22	And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. 
MAT.24.23	Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here 
MAT.24.24	For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if 
MAT.24.25	Behold, I have told you before. 
MAT.24.26	 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, 
MAT.24.27	For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 
MAT.24.28	 For wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
MAT.24.30	 and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 
MAT.24.31	And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
MAT.24.32	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer 
MAT.24.33	so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, 
MAT.24.34	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. 
MAT.24.35	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
MAT.24.36	But of that day and hour knoweth no 
MAT.24.37	 But as the days of Noah 
MAT.24.38	For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, 
MAT.24.39	 and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 
MAT.24.40	Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 
MAT.24.41	Two 
MAT.24.42	Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 
MAT.24.43	 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. 
MAT.24.44	Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
MAT.24.45	Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? 
MAT.24.46	Blessed 
MAT.24.47	Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. 
MAT.24.48	But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; 
MAT.24.49	and shall begin to smite 
MAT.24.50	the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for 
MAT.24.51	and shall cut him asunder, and appoint 
MAT.25.2	And five of them were wise, and five 
MAT.25.3	They that 
MAT.25.4	but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 
MAT.25.5	While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 
MAT.25.6	And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. 
MAT.25.7	Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 
MAT.25.8	And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. 
MAT.25.9	But the wise answered, saying, 
MAT.25.10	And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. 
MAT.25.11	 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 
MAT.25.12	But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 
MAT.25.13	Watch therefore; for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
MAT.25.15	And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. 
MAT.25.16	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made 
MAT.25.17	And likewise he that 
MAT.25.18	But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. 
MAT.25.19	After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. 
MAT.25.20	And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. 
MAT.25.21	His lord said unto him, Well done, 
MAT.25.22	He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. 
MAT.25.23	His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
MAT.25.24	Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed: 
MAT.25.25	and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, 
MAT.25.26	His lord answered and said unto him, 
MAT.25.27	thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and 
MAT.25.28	Take therefore the talent from him, and give 
MAT.25.29	 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. 
MAT.25.30	 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT.25.32	and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth 
MAT.25.33	and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 
MAT.25.34	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 
MAT.25.35	for I was ahungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 
MAT.25.36	naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 
MAT.25.37	Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee ahungered, and fed 
MAT.25.38	When saw we thee a stranger, and took 
MAT.25.39	Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 
MAT.25.40	And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done 
MAT.25.41	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 
MAT.25.42	for I was ahungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 
MAT.25.43	I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 
MAT.25.44	Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee ahungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? 
MAT.25.45	Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did 
MAT.25.46	 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
MAT.26.1	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, 
MAT.26.2	 Ye know that after two days is 
MAT.26.3	Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Cai´aphas, 
MAT.26.4	and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill 
MAT.26.5	But they said, Not on the feast 
MAT.26.6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
MAT.26.7	 there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. 
MAT.26.8	But when his disciples saw 
MAT.26.9	For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 
MAT.26.10	When Jesus understood 
MAT.26.11	 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. 
MAT.26.12	For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did 
MAT.26.13	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, 
MAT.26.14	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscar´i-ot, went unto the chief priests, 
MAT.26.15	and said 
MAT.26.16	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
MAT.26.17	Now the first 
MAT.26.18	And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. 
MAT.26.19	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
MAT.26.20	Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. 
MAT.26.21	And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
MAT.26.22	And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? 
MAT.26.23	And he answered and said, He that dippeth 
MAT.26.24	 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. 
MAT.26.25	Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.
MAT.26.26	And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed 
MAT.26.27	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave 
MAT.26.28	 for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. 
MAT.26.29	But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
MAT.26.30	And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. 
MAT.26.31	 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written,
MAT.26.31	I will smite the shepherd,
MAT.26.31	and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
MAT.26.33	Peter answered and said unto him, Though all 
MAT.26.34	Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
MAT.26.35	Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
MAT.26.36	Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsem´ane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 
MAT.26.37	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zeb´edee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. 
MAT.26.38	Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. 
MAT.26.39	And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou 
MAT.26.40	And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? 
MAT.26.41	Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed 
MAT.26.42	He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. 
MAT.26.43	And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. 
MAT.26.44	And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 
MAT.26.45	Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take 
MAT.26.46	Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
MAT.26.47	And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
MAT.26.48	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; hold him fast. 
MAT.26.49	And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Master; and kissed him. 
MAT.26.50	And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. 
MAT.26.51	And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out 
MAT.26.52	Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 
MAT.26.53	Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? 
MAT.26.54	But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? 
MAT.26.55	 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 
MAT.26.56	But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
MAT.26.57	And they that had laid hold on Jesus led 
MAT.26.58	But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. 
MAT.26.59	Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; 
MAT.26.60	but found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, 
MAT.26.61	 and said, This 
MAT.26.62	And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what 
MAT.26.63	But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 
MAT.26.64	 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
MAT.26.65	 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. 
MAT.26.66	What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. 
MAT.26.67	 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote 
MAT.26.68	saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
MAT.26.69	Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 
MAT.26.70	But he denied before 
MAT.26.71	And when he was gone out into the porch, another 
MAT.26.72	And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. 
MAT.26.73	And after a while came unto 
MAT.26.74	Then began he to curse and to swear, 
MAT.26.75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
MAT.27.1	When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 
MAT.27.2	and when they had bound him, they led 
MAT.27.4	saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What 
MAT.27.5	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. 
MAT.27.6	And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. 
MAT.27.7	And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. 
MAT.27.8	Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. 
MAT.27.9	 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
MAT.27.9	And they took the thirty pieces of silver,
MAT.27.9	the price of him that was valued,
MAT.27.9	whom they of the children of Israel did value;
MAT.27.10	and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
MAT.27.11	And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. 
MAT.27.12	And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 
MAT.27.13	Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? 
MAT.27.14	And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marveled greatly.
MAT.27.15	Now at 
MAT.27.16	And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barab´bas. 
MAT.27.17	Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barab´bas, or Jesus which is called Christ? 
MAT.27.18	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. 
MAT.27.19	When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. 
MAT.27.20	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barab´bas, and destroy Jesus. 
MAT.27.21	The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barab´bas. 
MAT.27.22	Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? 
MAT.27.23	And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
MAT.27.25	Then answered all the people, and said, His blood 
MAT.27.26	Then released he Barab´bas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered 
MAT.27.27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall,
MAT.27.28	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. 
MAT.27.29	And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put 
MAT.27.30	And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. 
MAT.27.31	And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify 
MAT.27.32	And as they came out, they found a man of Cyre´ne, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. 
MAT.27.33	And when they were come unto a place called Gol´gotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, 
MAT.27.34	they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted 
MAT.27.35	 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
MAT.27.35	They parted my garments among them,
MAT.27.35	and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
MAT.27.36	And sitting down they watched him there; 
MAT.27.37	and set up over his head his accusation written, 
MAT.27.38	Then were there two thieves crucified with him; one on the right hand, and another on the left. 
MAT.27.39	 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 
MAT.27.40	 and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest 
MAT.27.41	Likewise also the chief priests mocking 
MAT.27.42	He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. 
MAT.27.43	 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. 
MAT.27.44	The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
MAT.27.45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. 
MAT.27.46	 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabach´thani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
MAT.27.47	Some of them that stood there, when they heard 
MAT.27.48	 And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled 
MAT.27.49	The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Eli´jah will come to save him. 
MAT.27.50	Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
MAT.27.52	and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, 
MAT.27.53	and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. 
MAT.27.54	Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
MAT.27.56	among which was Mary Mag´dalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zeb´edee's children.
MAT.27.57	When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathe´a, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: 
MAT.27.58	he went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. 
MAT.27.59	And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
MAT.27.60	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. 
MAT.27.61	And there was Mary Mag´dalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
MAT.27.62	Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, 
MAT.27.63	 saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. 
MAT.27.64	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. 
MAT.27.65	Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make 
MAT.27.66	So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
MAT.28.1	In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first 
MAT.28.2	And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. 
MAT.28.3	His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 
MAT.28.4	and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead 
MAT.28.5	And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. 
MAT.28.6	He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 
MAT.28.7	And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. 
MAT.28.8	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. 
MAT.28.9	And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. 
MAT.28.10	Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
MAT.28.11	Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. 
MAT.28.12	And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 
MAT.28.13	saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him 
MAT.28.14	And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. 
MAT.28.15	So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
MAT.28.17	And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 
MAT.28.18	And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. 
MAT.28.19	 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 
MAT.28.20	teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, 
MRK.1.1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
MRK.1.2	Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,
MRK.1.2	which shall prepare thy way before thee.
MRK.1.3	Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
MRK.1.3	make his paths straight.
MRK.1.4	John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 
MRK.1.5	And there went out unto him all the land of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. 
MRK.1.6	 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 
MRK.1.7	and preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 
MRK.1.8	I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
MRK.1.9	And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 
MRK.1.10	And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 
MRK.1.11	 and there came a voice from heaven, 
MRK.1.12	And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. 
MRK.1.13	And he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
MRK.1.14	Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 
MRK.1.15	 and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
MRK.1.16	Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
MRK.1.17	And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. 
MRK.1.18	And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. 
MRK.1.19	And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the 
MRK.1.20	And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zeb´edee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
MRK.1.21	And they went into Caper´na-um; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. 
MRK.1.22	 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. 
MRK.1.23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
MRK.1.24	saying, Let 
MRK.1.25	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. 
MRK.1.26	And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 
MRK.1.27	And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine 
MRK.1.28	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
MRK.1.29	And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
MRK.1.30	But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever; and anon they tell him of her. 
MRK.1.31	And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
MRK.1.32	And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. 
MRK.1.33	And all the city was gathered together at the door. 
MRK.1.34	And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
MRK.1.35	And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. 
MRK.1.36	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. 
MRK.1.37	And when they had found him, they said unto him, All 
MRK.1.38	And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. 
MRK.1.39	 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
MRK.1.40	And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
MRK.1.41	And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth 
MRK.1.42	And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. 
MRK.1.43	And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 
MRK.1.44	 and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
MRK.1.45	But he went out, and began to publish 
MRK.2.1	And again he entered into Caper´na-um after 
MRK.2.2	And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive 
MRK.2.3	And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. 
MRK.2.4	And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken 
MRK.2.5	When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. 
MRK.2.6	But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 
MRK.2.7	Why doth this 
MRK.2.8	And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? 
MRK.2.9	whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, 
MRK.2.10	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) 
MRK.2.11	I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. 
MRK.2.12	And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
MRK.2.13	And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them. 
MRK.2.14	And as he passed by, he saw Levi the 
MRK.2.15	And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many, and they followed him. 
MRK.2.16	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? 
MRK.2.17	When Jesus heard 
MRK.2.18	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? 
MRK.2.19	And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. 
MRK.2.20	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. 
MRK.2.21	No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment; else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse. 
MRK.2.22	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.
MRK.2.24	And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? 
MRK.2.25	 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was ahungered, he, and they that were with him? 
MRK.2.26	 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abi´athar the high priest, and did eat the showbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? 
MRK.2.27	And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: 
MRK.2.28	therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
MRK.3.1	And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand. 
MRK.3.2	And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him. 
MRK.3.3	And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth. 
MRK.3.4	And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace. 
MRK.3.5	And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched 
MRK.3.6	And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Hero´di-ans against him, how they might destroy him.
MRK.3.7	But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea, 
MRK.3.8	and from Jerusalem, and from Idume´a, and 
MRK.3.9	 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. 
MRK.3.10	For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues. 
MRK.3.11	And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 
MRK.3.12	And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
MRK.3.13	And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth 
MRK.3.14	And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 
MRK.3.15	and to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils: 
MRK.3.16	and Simon he surnamed Peter; 
MRK.3.17	and James the 
MRK.3.18	And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the 
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscar´i-ot, which also betrayed him.
MRK.3.19	And they went into a house. 
MRK.3.20	And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
MRK.3.21	And when his friends heard 
MRK.3.22	 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beel´zebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils. 
MRK.3.23	And he called them 
MRK.3.24	And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 
MRK.3.25	And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 
MRK.3.26	And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. 
MRK.3.27	No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.
MRK.3.28	Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 
MRK.3.29	 but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation: 
MRK.3.30	because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
MRK.3.31	There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him. 
MRK.3.32	And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. 
MRK.3.33	And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren? 
MRK.3.34	And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! 
MRK.3.35	For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
MRK.4.2	And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, 
MRK.4.3	Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: 
MRK.4.4	and it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. 
MRK.4.5	And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: 
MRK.4.6	but when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 
MRK.4.7	And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 
MRK.4.8	And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased, and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundred. 
MRK.4.9	And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
MRK.4.10	And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. 
MRK.4.11	And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all 
MRK.4.12	and hearing they may hear, and not understand;
MRK.4.12	lest at any time they should be converted,
MRK.4.12	and 
MRK.4.13	And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables? 
MRK.4.14	The sower soweth the word. 
MRK.4.15	And these are they by the wayside, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. 
MRK.4.16	And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; 
MRK.4.17	and have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. 
MRK.4.18	And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, 
MRK.4.19	and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 
MRK.4.20	And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive 
MRK.4.22	 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. 
MRK.4.23	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 
MRK.4.24	 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear. With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you; and unto you that hear shall more be given. 
MRK.4.25	 For he that hath, to him shall be given; and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.
MRK.4.26	And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; 
MRK.4.27	and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. 
MRK.4.28	For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. 
MRK.4.29	But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
MRK.4.30	And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? 
MRK.4.31	 like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: 
MRK.4.32	but when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
MRK.4.33	And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear 
MRK.4.34	But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
MRK.4.35	And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. 
MRK.4.36	And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. 
MRK.4.37	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. 
MRK.4.38	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? 
MRK.4.39	And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
MRK.4.40	And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? 
MRK.4.41	And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
MRK.5.1	And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gad´arenes. 
MRK.5.2	And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
MRK.5.3	who had 
MRK.5.4	because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any 
MRK.5.5	And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. 
MRK.5.6	But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 
MRK.5.7	and cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, 
MRK.5.8	For he said unto him, Come out of the man, 
MRK.5.9	And he asked him, What 
MRK.5.10	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 
MRK.5.11	Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 
MRK.5.12	And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 
MRK.5.13	And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine; and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand,) and were choked in the sea.
MRK.5.14	And they that fed the swine fled, and told 
MRK.5.15	And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 
MRK.5.16	And they that saw 
MRK.5.17	And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. 
MRK.5.18	And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. 
MRK.5.19	Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee. 
MRK.5.20	And he departed, and began to publish in Decap´olis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all 
MRK.5.21	And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him; and he was nigh unto the sea. 
MRK.5.22	And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jai´rus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, 
MRK.5.23	and besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: 
MRK.5.24	And 
MRK.5.24	And much people followed him, and thronged him. 
MRK.5.25	And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, 
MRK.5.26	and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, 
MRK.5.27	when she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. 
MRK.5.28	For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. 
MRK.5.29	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in 
MRK.5.30	And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes? 
MRK.5.31	And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 
MRK.5.32	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. 
MRK.5.33	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 
MRK.5.34	And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
MRK.5.35	While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's 
MRK.5.36	As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe. 
MRK.5.37	And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. 
MRK.5.38	And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. 
MRK.5.39	And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. 
MRK.5.40	And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. 
MRK.5.41	And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Tal´itha cu´mi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, (I say unto thee,) arise. 
MRK.5.42	And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was 
MRK.5.43	And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
MRK.6.1	And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him. 
MRK.6.2	And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing 
MRK.6.3	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. 
MRK.6.4	 But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. 
MRK.6.5	And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed 
MRK.6.6	And he marveled because of their unbelief.
MRK.6.6	And he went round about the villages, teaching.
MRK.6.7	And he called 
MRK.6.8	 and commanded them that they should take nothing for 
MRK.6.9	but 
MRK.6.10	And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart from that place. 
MRK.6.11	 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomor´rah in the day of judgment, than for that city. 
MRK.6.12	And they went out, and preached that men should repent. 
MRK.6.13	 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed 
MRK.6.15	Others said, That it is Eli´jah. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. 
MRK.6.16	But when Herod heard 
MRK.6.17	 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Hero´di-as' sake, his brother Philip's wife; for he had married her. 
MRK.6.18	For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. 
MRK.6.19	Therefore Hero´di-as had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not: 
MRK.6.20	for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and a holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. 
MRK.6.21	And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief 
MRK.6.22	and when the daughter of the said Hero´di-as came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give 
MRK.6.23	And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give 
MRK.6.24	And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. 
MRK.6.25	And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. 
MRK.6.26	And the king was exceeding sorry; 
MRK.6.27	And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 
MRK.6.28	and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	And when his disciples heard 
MRK.6.30	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. 
MRK.6.31	And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. 
MRK.6.32	And they departed into a desert place by ship privately. 
MRK.6.33	And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him. 
MRK.6.34	 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. 
MRK.6.35	And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time 
MRK.6.36	send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat. 
MRK.6.37	He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat? 
MRK.6.38	He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. 
MRK.6.39	And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. 
MRK.6.41	And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave 
MRK.6.42	And they did all eat, and were filled. 
MRK.6.43	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes. 
MRK.6.44	And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
MRK.6.45	And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsai´da, while he sent away the people. 
MRK.6.46	And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray. 
MRK.6.47	And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. 
MRK.6.48	And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them. 
MRK.6.49	But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out: 
MRK.6.50	for they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. 
MRK.6.51	And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered. 
MRK.6.52	For they considered not 
MRK.6.53	And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennes´aret, and drew to the shore. 
MRK.6.54	And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him, 
MRK.6.55	and ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. 
MRK.6.56	And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
MRK.7.1	Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. 
MRK.7.2	And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen hands, they found fault. 
MRK.7.3	For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash 
MRK.7.4	And 
MRK.7.5	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? 
MRK.7.6	 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written,
MRK.7.6	This people honoreth me with 
MRK.7.6	but their heart is far from me.
MRK.7.7	Howbeit in vain do they worship me,
MRK.7.7	teaching 
MRK.7.8	For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, 
MRK.7.9	And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. 
MRK.7.10	 For Moses said,
MRK.7.10	Honor thy father and thy mother;
MRK.7.10	and,
MRK.7.10	Whoso curseth father or mother,
MRK.7.10	let him die the death:
MRK.7.11	but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, 
MRK.7.12	And ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother; 
MRK.7.13	making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.
MRK.7.14	And when he had called all the people 
MRK.7.15	there is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. 
MRK.7.16	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 
MRK.7.17	And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 
MRK.7.18	And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, 
MRK.7.19	because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
MRK.7.20	And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 
MRK.7.21	For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 
MRK.7.22	thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 
MRK.7.23	all these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
MRK.7.24	And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into a house, and would have no man know 
MRK.7.25	For a 
MRK.7.26	the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoeni´cian by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. 
MRK.7.27	But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast 
MRK.7.28	And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 
MRK.7.29	And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. 
MRK.7.30	And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
MRK.7.31	And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decap´olis. 
MRK.7.32	And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. 
MRK.7.33	And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; 
MRK.7.34	and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Eph´phatha, that is, Be opened. 
MRK.7.35	And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. 
MRK.7.36	And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published 
MRK.7.37	and were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
MRK.8.1	In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples 
MRK.8.2	I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat: 
MRK.8.3	and if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far. 
MRK.8.4	And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these 
MRK.8.5	And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. 
MRK.8.6	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before 
MRK.8.7	And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before 
MRK.8.8	So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken 
MRK.8.9	And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away. 
MRK.8.10	And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanu´tha.
MRK.8.12	 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation. 
MRK.8.13	And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
MRK.8.14	Now 
MRK.8.15	 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and 
MRK.8.16	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, 
MRK.8.17	And when Jesus knew 
MRK.8.18	 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember? 
MRK.8.19	When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve. 
MRK.8.20	And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. 
MRK.8.21	And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?
MRK.8.22	And he cometh to Bethsai´da; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. 
MRK.8.23	And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught. 
MRK.8.24	And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. 
MRK.8.25	After that he put 
MRK.8.26	And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell 
MRK.8.27	And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesare´a Phil´ippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am? 
MRK.8.28	 And they answered, John the Baptist: but some 
MRK.8.29	 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. 
MRK.8.30	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
MRK.8.31	And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and 
MRK.8.32	And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. 
MRK.8.33	But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
MRK.8.35	 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. 
MRK.8.36	For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? 
MRK.8.37	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? 
MRK.8.38	Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
MRK.9.1	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
MRK.9.3	And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them. 
MRK.9.4	And there appeared unto them Eli´jah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. 
MRK.9.5	And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Eli´jah. 
MRK.9.6	For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid. 
MRK.9.7	 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 
MRK.9.8	And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
MRK.9.9	And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead. 
MRK.9.10	And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean. 
MRK.9.11	 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Eli´jah must first come? 
MRK.9.12	And he answered and told them, Eli´jah verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. 
MRK.9.13	But I say unto you, That Eli´jah is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.
MRK.9.14	And when he came to 
MRK.9.15	And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to 
MRK.9.16	And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? 
MRK.9.17	And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit; 
MRK.9.18	and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him; and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not. 
MRK.9.19	He answereth him,
MRK.9.20	And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. 
MRK.9.21	And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child. 
MRK.9.22	And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us. 
MRK.9.23	Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe,
MRK.9.24	And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. 
MRK.9.25	When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, 
MRK.9.26	And 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose. 
MRK.9.28	And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out? 
MRK.9.29	And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
MRK.9.30	And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know 
MRK.9.31	For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day. 
MRK.9.32	But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
MRK.9.33	And he came to Caper´na-um: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way? 
MRK.9.34	 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who 
MRK.9.35	 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, 
MRK.9.36	And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them, 
MRK.9.37	 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
MRK.9.38	And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbade him, because he followeth not us. 
MRK.9.39	But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. 
MRK.9.40	 For he that is not against us is on our part. 
MRK.9.41	 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.
MRK.9.42	And whosoever shall offend one of 
MRK.9.43	 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: 
MRK.9.44	where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
MRK.9.45	And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: 
MRK.9.46	where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
MRK.9.47	 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: 
MRK.9.48	 where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
MRK.9.49	For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. 
MRK.9.50	 Salt 
MRK.10.1	And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
MRK.10.2	And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away 
MRK.10.3	And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you? 
MRK.10.4	 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put 
MRK.10.5	And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. 
MRK.10.6	 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. 
MRK.10.7	 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; 
MRK.10.8	and they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. 
MRK.10.9	What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
MRK.10.10	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same 
MRK.10.11	 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. 
MRK.10.12	And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
MRK.10.13	And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them; and 
MRK.10.14	But when Jesus saw 
MRK.10.15	 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. 
MRK.10.16	And he took them up in his arms, put 
MRK.10.17	And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? 
MRK.10.18	And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? 
MRK.10.19	 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy father and mother. 
MRK.10.20	And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. 
MRK.10.21	Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross,
MRK.10.22	And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
MRK.10.23	And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
MRK.10.24	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches
MRK.10.25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
MRK.10.26	And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? 
MRK.10.27	And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men 
MRK.10.28	Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. 
MRK.10.29	And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, 
MRK.10.30	but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. 
MRK.10.31	 But many 
MRK.10.32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him, 
MRK.10.33	, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles: 
MRK.10.34	and they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him; and the third day he shall rise again.
MRK.10.35	And James and John, the sons of Zeb´edee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire. 
MRK.10.36	And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you? 
MRK.10.37	They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. 
MRK.10.38	 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? 
MRK.10.39	And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: 
MRK.10.40	but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but 
MRK.10.41	And when the ten heard 
MRK.10.42	 But Jesus called them 
MRK.10.43	 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: 
MRK.10.44	and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. 
MRK.10.45	For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
MRK.10.46	And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartime´us, the son of Time´us, sat by the highway side begging. 
MRK.10.47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, 
MRK.10.48	And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, 
MRK.10.49	And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. 
MRK.10.50	And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. 
MRK.10.51	And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. 
MRK.10.52	And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
MRK.11.1	And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, 
MRK.11.2	and saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring 
MRK.11.3	And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. 
MRK.11.4	And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him. 
MRK.11.5	And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? 
MRK.11.6	And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go. 
MRK.11.7	And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him. 
MRK.11.8	And many spread their garments in the way; and others cut down branches off the trees, and strewed 
MRK.11.9	 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying,
MRK.11.9	Hosanna; Blessed 
MRK.11.10	Blessed 
MRK.11.10	that cometh in the name of the Lord:
MRK.11.10	Hosanna in the highest.
MRK.11.11	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
MRK.11.12	And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry: 
MRK.11.13	and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not 
MRK.11.14	And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard 
MRK.11.15	And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves; 
MRK.11.16	and would not suffer that any man should carry 
MRK.11.17	 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. 
MRK.11.18	And the scribes and chief priests heard 
MRK.11.19	And when even was come, he went out of the city.
MRK.11.20	And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. 
MRK.11.21	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. 
MRK.11.22	And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. 
MRK.11.23	 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. 
MRK.11.24	Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive 
MRK.11.25	 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. 
MRK.11.26	But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
MRK.11.27	And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, 
MRK.11.28	and say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things? 
MRK.11.29	And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
MRK.11.30	The baptism of John, was 
MRK.11.31	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? 
MRK.11.32	But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all 
MRK.11.33	And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
MRK.12.2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. 
MRK.12.3	And they caught 
MRK.12.4	And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded 
MRK.12.5	And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some. 
MRK.12.6	Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. 
MRK.12.7	But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. 
MRK.12.8	And they took him, and killed 
MRK.12.9	What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. 
MRK.12.10	 And have ye not read this Scripture;
MRK.12.10	The stone which the builders rejected
MRK.12.10	is become the head of the corner:
MRK.12.11	this was the Lord's doing,
MRK.12.11	and it is marvelous in our eyes?
MRK.12.12	And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people; for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
MRK.12.13	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Hero´dians, to catch him in 
MRK.12.14	And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 
MRK.12.15	Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see 
MRK.12.16	And they brought 
MRK.12.17	And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marveled at him.
MRK.12.19	 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave 
MRK.12.20	Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. 
MRK.12.21	And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. 
MRK.12.22	And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. 
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
MRK.12.24	And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God? 
MRK.12.25	For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. 
MRK.12.26	 And as touching the dead, that they rise; have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I 
MRK.12.27	He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.
MRK.12.29	 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments 
MRK.12.29	Hear, O Israel;
MRK.12.29	The Lord our God is one Lord:
MRK.12.30	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
MRK.12.30	with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
MRK.12.30	and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength:
MRK.12.30	this 
MRK.12.31	 And the second 
MRK.12.31	Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
MRK.12.31	There is none other commandment greater than these. 
MRK.12.32	 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: 
MRK.12.33	 and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love 
MRK.12.34	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him 
MRK.12.35	And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? 
MRK.12.36	 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost,
MRK.12.36	The 
MRK.12.36	Sit thou on my right hand,
MRK.12.36	till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
MRK.12.37	David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he 
MRK.12.38	And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and 
MRK.12.39	and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: 
MRK.12.40	which devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
MRK.12.41	And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. 
MRK.12.42	And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. 
MRK.12.43	And he called 
MRK.12.44	for all 
MRK.13.1	And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings 
MRK.13.2	And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
MRK.13.3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 
MRK.13.4	Tell us, when shall these things be? and what 
MRK.13.5	And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any 
MRK.13.6	for many shall come in my name, saying, I am 
MRK.13.7	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, be ye not troubled: for 
MRK.13.8	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these 
MRK.13.10	And the gospel must first be published among all nations. 
MRK.13.11	But when they shall lead 
MRK.13.12	Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against 
MRK.13.13	 And ye shall be hated of all 
MRK.13.15	 and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter 
MRK.13.16	and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment. 
MRK.13.17	But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! 
MRK.13.18	And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter. 
MRK.13.19	 For 
MRK.13.20	And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days. 
MRK.13.21	And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here 
MRK.13.22	for false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if 
MRK.13.23	But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
MRK.13.25	and the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. 
MRK.13.26	 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. 
MRK.13.27	And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
MRK.13.28	Now learn a parable of the fig tree: When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: 
MRK.13.29	so ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, 
MRK.13.30	Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done. 
MRK.13.31	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
MRK.13.33	Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. 
MRK.13.35	Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: 
MRK.13.36	lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. 
MRK.13.37	And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
MRK.14.2	But they said, Not on the feast 
MRK.14.4	And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? 
MRK.14.5	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her. 
MRK.14.6	And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. 
MRK.14.7	 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always. 
MRK.14.8	She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying. 
MRK.14.9	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, 
MRK.14.10	And Judas Iscar´i-ot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them. 
MRK.14.11	And when they heard 
MRK.14.12	And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover? 
MRK.14.13	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him. 
MRK.14.14	And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guest chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? 
MRK.14.15	And he will show you a large upper room furnished 
MRK.14.16	And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
MRK.14.17	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. 
MRK.14.18	And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me. 
MRK.14.19	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, 
MRK.14.20	And he answered and said unto them, 
MRK.14.21	 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.
MRK.14.22	And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake 
MRK.14.23	And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave 
MRK.14.24	 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many. 
MRK.14.25	Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
MRK.14.26	And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. 
MRK.14.27	 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written,
MRK.14.27	I will smite the shepherd,
MRK.14.27	and the sheep shall be scattered.
MRK.14.29	But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet 
MRK.14.30	And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, 
MRK.14.31	But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.
MRK.14.32	And they came to a place which was named Gethsem´ane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray. 
MRK.14.33	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; 
MRK.14.34	and saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch. 
MRK.14.35	And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. 
MRK.14.36	And he said, Abba, Father, all things 
MRK.14.37	And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? 
MRK.14.38	Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly 
MRK.14.39	And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words. 
MRK.14.40	And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him. 
MRK.14.41	And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take 
MRK.14.42	Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
MRK.14.43	And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 
MRK.14.44	And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead 
MRK.14.45	And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, Master; and kissed him. 
MRK.14.46	And they laid their hands on him, and took him. 
MRK.14.47	And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 
MRK.14.48	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and 
MRK.14.49	 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the Scriptures must be fulfilled. 
MRK.14.50	And they all forsook him, and fled.
MRK.14.51	And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about 
MRK.14.52	and he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
MRK.14.53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. 
MRK.14.54	And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire. 
MRK.14.55	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none. 
MRK.14.56	For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together. 
MRK.14.57	And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, 
MRK.14.58	 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands. 
MRK.14.59	But neither so did their witness agree together. 
MRK.14.60	And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what 
MRK.14.61	But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? 
MRK.14.62	 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
MRK.14.63	Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? 
MRK.14.64	 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. 
MRK.14.65	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
MRK.14.66	And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest: 
MRK.14.67	and when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. 
MRK.14.68	But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew. 
MRK.14.69	And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is 
MRK.14.70	And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art 
MRK.14.71	But he began to curse and to swear, 
MRK.14.72	And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.
MRK.15.1	And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried 
MRK.15.2	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest 
MRK.15.3	And the chief priests accused him of many things; but he answered nothing. 
MRK.15.4	And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. 
MRK.15.5	But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marveled.
MRK.15.6	Now at 
MRK.15.7	And there was 
MRK.15.8	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire 
MRK.15.9	But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
MRK.15.10	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. 
MRK.15.11	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barab´bas unto them. 
MRK.15.12	And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do 
MRK.15.13	And they cried out again, Crucify him. 
MRK.15.14	Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. 
MRK.15.15	And 
MRK.15.16	And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Preto´ri-um; and they call together the whole band. 
MRK.15.17	And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his 
MRK.15.18	and began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
MRK.15.19	And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing 
MRK.15.20	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
MRK.15.22	And they bring him unto the place Gol´gotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. 
MRK.15.23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received 
MRK.15.24	 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. 
MRK.15.25	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 
MRK.15.26	And the superscription of his accusation was written over, 
MRK.15.27	And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. 
MRK.15.28	 And the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. 
MRK.15.29	 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest 
MRK.15.30	save thyself, and come down from the cross. 
MRK.15.31	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. 
MRK.15.32	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
MRK.15.33	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 
MRK.15.34	 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, E´lo-i, E´lo-i, lama sabach´thani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
MRK.15.35	And some of them that stood by, when they heard 
MRK.15.36	 And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put 
MRK.15.37	And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. 
MRK.15.38	 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. 
MRK.15.39	And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
MRK.15.41	who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
MRK.15.42	And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathe´a, an honorable counselor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. 
MRK.15.44	And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling 
MRK.15.45	And when he knew 
MRK.15.46	And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. 
MRK.15.47	And Mary Mag´dalene and Mary 
MRK.16.1	And when the sabbath was past, Mary Mag´dalene, and Mary the 
MRK.16.2	And very early in the morning, the first 
MRK.16.3	And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? 
MRK.16.4	And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. 
MRK.16.5	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. 
MRK.16.6	And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. 
MRK.16.7	 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. 
MRK.16.8	And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any 
MRK.16.9	Now when 
MRK.16.10	 she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. 
MRK.16.11	And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
MRK.16.12	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country. 
MRK.16.13	And they went and told 
MRK.16.14	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. 
MRK.16.15	 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 
MRK.16.16	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. 
MRK.16.17	And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 
MRK.16.18	they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
MRK.16.20	And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with 
LUK.1.1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, 
LUK.1.2	even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 
LUK.1.3	it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of
LUK.1.4	that thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.
LUK.1.6	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 
LUK.1.7	And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren; and they both were 
LUK.1.8	And it came to pass, that, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, 
LUK.1.9	according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. 
LUK.1.10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. 
LUK.1.11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. 
LUK.1.12	And when Zechari´ah saw 
LUK.1.13	But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zechari´ah: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. 
LUK.1.14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. 
LUK.1.15	 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. 
LUK.1.16	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. 
LUK.1.17	 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Eli´jah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. 
LUK.1.18	And Zechari´ah said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. 
LUK.1.19	 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee these glad tidings. 
LUK.1.20	And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. 
LUK.1.21	And the people waited for Zechari´ah, and marveled that he tarried so long in the temple. 
LUK.1.22	And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless. 
LUK.1.23	And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
LUK.1.24	And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, 
LUK.1.25	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on 
LUK.1.26	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 
LUK.1.27	 to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name 
LUK.1.28	And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, 
LUK.1.29	And when she saw 
LUK.1.30	And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God. 
LUK.1.31	 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name 
LUK.1.32	 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 
LUK.1.33	and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 
LUK.1.34	Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 
LUK.1.35	And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. 
LUK.1.36	And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. 
LUK.1.37	 For with God nothing shall be impossible. 
LUK.1.38	And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
LUK.1.39	And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah; 
LUK.1.40	and entered into the house of Zechari´ah, and saluted Elisabeth. 
LUK.1.41	And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: 
LUK.1.42	and she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed 
LUK.1.43	And whence 
LUK.1.44	For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 
LUK.1.45	And blessed 
LUK.1.46	 And Mary said,
LUK.1.46	My soul doth magnify the Lord,
LUK.1.47	and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
LUK.1.48	For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden:
LUK.1.48	for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
LUK.1.49	For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;
LUK.1.49	and holy 
LUK.1.50	And his mercy 
LUK.1.50	from generation to generation.
LUK.1.51	He hath showed strength with his arm;
LUK.1.51	he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
LUK.1.52	He hath put down the mighty from 
LUK.1.52	and exalted them of low degree.
LUK.1.53	He hath filled the hungry with good things;
LUK.1.53	and the rich he hath sent empty away.
LUK.1.54	He hath holpen his servant Israel,
LUK.1.54	in remembrance of 
LUK.1.55	to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
LUK.1.56	And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
LUK.1.57	Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. 
LUK.1.58	And her neighbors and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her. 
LUK.1.59	 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zechari´ah, after the name of his father. 
LUK.1.60	And his mother answered and said, Not 
LUK.1.61	And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. 
LUK.1.62	And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. 
LUK.1.63	And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marveled all. 
LUK.1.64	And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue 
LUK.1.65	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea. 
LUK.1.66	And all they that heard 
LUK.1.67	And his father Zechari´ah was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,
LUK.1.68	Blessed 
LUK.1.68	for he hath visited and redeemed his people,
LUK.1.69	and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us
LUK.1.69	in the house of his servant David;
LUK.1.70	as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets,
LUK.1.70	which have been since the world began:
LUK.1.71	that we should be saved from our enemies,
LUK.1.71	and from the hand of all that hate us;
LUK.1.72	to perform the mercy 
LUK.1.72	and to remember his holy covenant;
LUK.1.73	the oath which he sware to our father Abraham,
LUK.1.74	that he would grant unto us, that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,
LUK.1.74	might serve him without fear,
LUK.1.75	in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
LUK.1.76	for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
LUK.1.77	to give knowledge of salvation unto his people
LUK.1.77	by the remission of their sins,
LUK.1.78	through the tender mercy of our God;
LUK.1.78	whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,
LUK.1.79	to guide our feet into the way of peace.
LUK.1.80	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.
LUK.2.1	And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.
LUK.2.2	(
LUK.2.3	And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 
LUK.2.4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, (because he was of the house and lineage of David,) 
LUK.2.5	to be taxed
LUK.2.6	And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. 
LUK.2.7	And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
LUK.2.8	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
LUK.2.9	And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid. 
LUK.2.10	And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 
LUK.2.11	For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. 
LUK.2.12	And this 
LUK.2.13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
LUK.2.14	Glory to God in the highest,
LUK.2.14	and on earth peace,
LUK.2.14	good will toward men.
LUK.2.15	And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. 
LUK.2.16	And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. 
LUK.2.17	And when they had seen 
LUK.2.18	And all they that heard 
LUK.2.19	But Mary kept all these things, and pondered 
LUK.2.20	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.
LUK.2.23	 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) 
LUK.2.24	and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. 
LUK.2.25	And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name 
LUK.2.26	And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. 
LUK.2.27	And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, 
LUK.2.28	then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
LUK.2.29	Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
LUK.2.29	according to thy word:
LUK.2.30	for mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
LUK.2.31	which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
LUK.2.32	and the glory of thy people Israel.
LUK.2.33	And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him. 
LUK.2.34	And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this 
LUK.2.35	(yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also;) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
LUK.2.36	And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phan´u-el, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity; 
LUK.2.37	and she 
LUK.2.38	And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in
LUK.2.40	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.
LUK.2.42	And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. 
LUK.2.43	And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not 
LUK.2.44	But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among 
LUK.2.45	And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. 
LUK.2.46	And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. 
LUK.2.47	And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. 
LUK.2.48	And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. 
LUK.2.49	And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?
LUK.2.50	And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. 
LUK.2.51	And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
LUK.3.1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tibe´ri-us Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturae´a and of the region of Trachoni´tis, and Lysa´ni-as the tetrarch of Abile´ne, 
LUK.3.2	Annas and Cai´aphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zechari´ah in the wilderness. 
LUK.3.3	And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; 
LUK.3.4	 as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying,
LUK.3.4	The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
LUK.3.4	Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
LUK.3.4	make his paths straight.
LUK.3.5	Every valley shall be filled,
LUK.3.5	and every mountain and hill shall be brought low;
LUK.3.5	and the crooked shall be made straight,
LUK.3.5	and the rough ways 
LUK.3.6	and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
LUK.3.8	 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to 
LUK.3.9	 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
LUK.3.10	And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? 
LUK.3.11	He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. 
LUK.3.12	 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? 
LUK.3.13	And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. 
LUK.3.14	And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse 
LUK.3.15	And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; 
LUK.3.16	John answered, saying unto 
LUK.3.17	whose fan 
LUK.3.18	And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people. 
LUK.3.19	 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Hero´di-as his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, 
LUK.3.20	added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.
LUK.3.21	Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 
LUK.3.22	 and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.
LUK.3.23	And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was 
LUK.3.24	which was 
LUK.3.25	which was 
LUK.3.26	which was 
LUK.3.27	which was 
LUK.3.28	which was 
LUK.3.29	which was 
LUK.3.30	which was 
LUK.3.31	which was 
LUK.3.32	which was 
LUK.3.33	which was 
LUK.3.34	which was 
LUK.3.35	which was 
LUK.3.36	which was 
LUK.3.37	which was 
LUK.3.38	which was 
LUK.4.1	And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 
LUK.4.2	being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. 
LUK.4.3	And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. 
LUK.4.4	 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. 
LUK.4.5	And the devil, taking him up into a high mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
LUK.4.6	And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will, I give it. 
LUK.4.7	If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. 
LUK.4.8	 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written,
LUK.4.8	Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
LUK.4.8	and him only shalt thou serve.
LUK.4.9	And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: 
LUK.4.10	 for it is written,
LUK.4.10	He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:
LUK.4.11	lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
LUK.4.13	And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.
LUK.4.14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about. 
LUK.4.15	And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
LUK.4.16	And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. 
LUK.4.17	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
LUK.4.18	because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor;
LUK.4.18	he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted,
LUK.4.18	to preach deliverance to the captives,
LUK.4.18	and recovering of sight to the blind,
LUK.4.18	to set at liberty them that are bruised,
LUK.4.19	to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
LUK.4.20	And he closed the book, and he gave 
LUK.4.21	And he began to say unto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears. 
LUK.4.22	And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son? 
LUK.4.23	And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Caper´na-um, do also here in thy country. 
LUK.4.24	 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country. 
LUK.4.25	 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Eli´jah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; 
LUK.4.26	 but unto none of them was Eli´jah sent, save unto Zar´ephath, 
LUK.4.27	 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eli´sha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Na´aman the Syrian. 
LUK.4.28	And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, 
LUK.4.29	and rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong. 
LUK.4.30	But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way, 
LUK.4.31	and came down to Caper´na-um, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days. 
LUK.4.32	 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.
LUK.4.33	And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, 
LUK.4.34	saying, Let 
LUK.4.35	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not. 
LUK.4.36	And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word 
LUK.4.37	And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.
LUK.4.38	And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her. 
LUK.4.39	And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.
LUK.4.40	Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. 
LUK.4.41	And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking 
LUK.4.42	And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. 
LUK.4.43	And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent. 
LUK.4.44	And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
LUK.5.2	and saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing 
LUK.5.3	And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. 
LUK.5.4	Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. 
LUK.5.5	 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. 
LUK.5.6	 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. 
LUK.5.7	And they beckoned unto 
LUK.5.8	When Simon Peter saw 
LUK.5.9	For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: 
LUK.5.10	and so 
LUK.5.11	And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.
LUK.5.12	And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy; who seeing Jesus fell on 
LUK.5.13	And he put forth 
LUK.5.14	 And he charged him to tell no man: But go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
LUK.5.15	But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. 
LUK.5.16	And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
LUK.5.17	And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was 
LUK.5.18	And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought 
LUK.5.19	And when they could not find by what 
LUK.5.20	And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. 
LUK.5.21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 
LUK.5.22	But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? 
LUK.5.23	whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? 
LUK.5.24	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. 
LUK.5.25	And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. 
LUK.5.26	And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.
LUK.5.27	And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me. 
LUK.5.28	And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
LUK.5.29	And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. 
LUK.5.30	 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 
LUK.5.31	And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. 
LUK.5.32	I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
LUK.5.33	And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise 
LUK.5.34	And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? 
LUK.5.35	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. 
LUK.5.36	And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was 
LUK.5.37	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. 
LUK.5.38	But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved. 
LUK.5.39	No man also having drunk old 
LUK.6.2	And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days? 
LUK.6.3	 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was ahungered, and they which were with him; 
LUK.6.4	 how he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? 
LUK.6.5	And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
LUK.6.6	And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered. 
LUK.6.7	And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him. 
LUK.6.8	But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. 
LUK.6.9	Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy 
LUK.6.10	And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other. 
LUK.6.11	And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. 
LUK.6.13	And when it was day, he called 
LUK.6.14	Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, 
LUK.6.15	Matthew and Thomas, James the 
LUK.6.16	and Judas 
LUK.6.17	And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 
LUK.6.18	and they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed. 
LUK.6.19	And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed 
LUK.6.20	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed 
LUK.6.21	Blessed 
LUK.6.23	 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward 
LUK.6.24	But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
LUK.6.25	Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
LUK.6.26	Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.
LUK.6.27	But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
LUK.6.28	bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
LUK.6.29	And unto him that smiteth thee on the 
LUK.6.30	Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask 
LUK.6.31	 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
LUK.6.32	For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 
LUK.6.33	And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
LUK.6.34	And if ye lend 
LUK.6.35	But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and 
LUK.6.36	Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
LUK.6.37	Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
LUK.6.38	give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
LUK.6.40	 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master. 
LUK.6.41	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 
LUK.6.42	Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.
LUK.6.43	For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 
LUK.6.44	 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. 
LUK.6.45	 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
LUK.6.46	And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? 
LUK.6.47	Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like: 
LUK.6.48	he is like a man which built a house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it; for it was founded upon a rock. 
LUK.6.49	But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.
LUK.7.1	Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Caper´na-um. 
LUK.7.2	And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. 
LUK.7.3	And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. 
LUK.7.4	And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: 
LUK.7.5	for he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. 
LUK.7.6	Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: 
LUK.7.7	wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. 
LUK.7.8	For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth 
LUK.7.9	When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 
LUK.7.10	And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.
LUK.7.11	And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. 
LUK.7.12	Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. 
LUK.7.13	And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. 
LUK.7.14	And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare 
LUK.7.15	And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. 
LUK.7.16	And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. 
LUK.7.17	And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judea, and throughout all the region round about.
LUK.7.18	And the disciples of John showed him of all these things. 
LUK.7.19	And John calling 
LUK.7.20	When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 
LUK.7.21	And in that same hour he cured many of 
LUK.7.22	 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached. 
LUK.7.23	And blessed is 
LUK.7.24	And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 
LUK.7.25	But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously appareled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts. 
LUK.7.26	But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. 
LUK.7.27	 This is 
LUK.7.27	Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,
LUK.7.27	which shall prepare thy way before thee.
LUK.7.28	For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet
LUK.7.29	 And all the people that heard 
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.
LUK.7.31	And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? 
LUK.7.32	They are like unto children sitting in the market place, and calling one to another, and saying,
LUK.7.32	We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced;
LUK.7.32	we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.
LUK.7.33	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. 
LUK.7.34	The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! 
LUK.7.35	But wisdom is justified of all her children.
LUK.7.36	And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. 
LUK.7.37	 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that 
LUK.7.38	and stood at his feet behind 
LUK.7.39	Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw 
LUK.7.40	And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. 
LUK.7.41	There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 
LUK.7.42	And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? 
LUK.7.43	Simon answered and said, I suppose that 
LUK.7.44	And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped 
LUK.7.45	Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. 
LUK.7.46	My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. 
LUK.7.47	Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, 
LUK.7.48	And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. 
LUK.7.49	And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? 
LUK.7.50	And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
LUK.8.1	And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve 
LUK.8.2	 and certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Mag´dalene, out of whom went seven devils, 
LUK.8.3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.
LUK.8.4	And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable: 
LUK.8.5	A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. 
LUK.8.6	And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. 
LUK.8.7	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. 
LUK.8.8	And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit a hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
LUK.8.9	And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? 
LUK.8.10	 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables;
LUK.8.10	that seeing they might not see,
LUK.8.10	and hearing they might not understand.
LUK.8.11	Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 
LUK.8.12	Those by the wayside are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. 
LUK.8.13	They on the rock 
LUK.8.14	And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of 
LUK.8.15	But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep 
LUK.8.17	 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither 
LUK.8.18	 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.
LUK.8.19	Then came to him 
LUK.8.20	And it was told him 
LUK.8.21	And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.
LUK.8.22	Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. 
LUK.8.23	But as they sailed, he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled 
LUK.8.24	And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, Master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. 
LUK.8.25	And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.
LUK.8.26	And they arrived at the country of the Gad´arenes, which is over against Galilee. 
LUK.8.27	And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in 
LUK.8.28	When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, 
LUK.8.29	(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.) 
LUK.8.30	And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him. 
LUK.8.31	And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep. 
LUK.8.32	And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them. 
LUK.8.33	Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.
LUK.8.34	When they that fed 
LUK.8.35	Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 
LUK.8.36	They also which saw 
LUK.8.37	Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gad´arenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again. 
LUK.8.38	Now the man, out of whom the devils were departed, besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, 
LUK.8.39	Return to thine own house, and show how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.
LUK.8.40	And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people 
LUK.8.41	And, behold, there came a man named Jai´rus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: 
LUK.8.42	for he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying.
LUK.8.42	But as he went the people thronged him. 
LUK.8.43	And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, 
LUK.8.44	came behind 
LUK.8.45	And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press 
LUK.8.46	And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. 
LUK.8.47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. 
LUK.8.48	And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
LUK.8.49	While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's 
LUK.8.50	But when Jesus heard 
LUK.8.51	And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. 
LUK.8.52	And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth. 
LUK.8.53	And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. 
LUK.8.54	And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise. 
LUK.8.55	And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat. 
LUK.8.56	And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.
LUK.9.1	Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. 
LUK.9.2	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. 
LUK.9.3	 And he said unto them, Take nothing for 
LUK.9.4	And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart. 
LUK.9.5	 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. 
LUK.9.6	And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.
LUK.9.8	and of some, that Eli´jah had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. 
LUK.9.9	And Herod said, John have I beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.
LUK.9.10	And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsai´da. 
LUK.9.11	And the people, when they knew 
LUK.9.12	And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place. 
LUK.9.13	But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people. 
LUK.9.14	For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company. 
LUK.9.15	And they did so, and made them all sit down. 
LUK.9.16	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. 
LUK.9.17	And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
LUK.9.18	And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him; and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am? 
LUK.9.19	 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some 
LUK.9.20	 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
LUK.9.21	And he straitly charged them, and commanded 
LUK.9.22	saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.
LUK.9.24	 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. 
LUK.9.25	For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away? 
LUK.9.26	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and 
LUK.9.27	But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
LUK.9.29	And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment 
LUK.9.30	And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Eli´jah: 
LUK.9.31	who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.32	But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. 
LUK.9.33	And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Eli´jah: not knowing what he said. 
LUK.9.34	While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. 
LUK.9.35	 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 
LUK.9.36	And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept 
LUK.9.37	And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him. 
LUK.9.38	And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son; for he is mine only child. 
LUK.9.39	And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him, hardly departeth from him. 
LUK.9.40	And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. 
LUK.9.41	And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. 
LUK.9.42	And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare 
LUK.9.43	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God.
LUK.9.43	But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, 
LUK.9.44	Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men. 
LUK.9.45	But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.
LUK.9.47	And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him, 
LUK.9.48	 and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
LUK.9.49	And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us. 
LUK.9.50	And Jesus said unto him, Forbid 
LUK.9.51	And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 
LUK.9.52	and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 
LUK.9.53	And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.54	 And when his disciples James and John saw 
LUK.9.55	But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. 
LUK.9.56	For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save 
LUK.9.57	And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain 
LUK.9.58	And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air 
LUK.9.59	And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 
LUK.9.60	Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. 
LUK.9.61	 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. 
LUK.9.62	And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
LUK.10.1	After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. 
LUK.10.2	 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly 
LUK.10.3	 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. 
LUK.10.4	 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. 
LUK.10.5	And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace 
LUK.10.6	And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. 
LUK.10.7	 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 
LUK.10.8	And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: 
LUK.10.9	and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 
LUK.10.10	 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, 
LUK.10.11	Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding, be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 
LUK.10.12	 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
LUK.10.14	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you. 
LUK.10.15	 And thou, Caper´na-um, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.
LUK.10.17	And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. 
LUK.10.18	And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. 
LUK.10.19	 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means hurt you. 
LUK.10.20	Notwithstanding, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.
LUK.10.21	In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. 
LUK.10.22	 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and 
LUK.10.23	And he turned him unto 
LUK.10.24	for I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen 
LUK.10.26	He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? 
LUK.10.27	 And he answering said,
LUK.10.27	Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
LUK.10.27	with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
LUK.10.27	and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind;
LUK.10.27	and thy neighbor as thyself.
LUK.10.29	But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor? 
LUK.10.30	And Jesus answering said, A certain 
LUK.10.31	And by chance there came down a certain priest that way; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 
LUK.10.32	And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked 
LUK.10.33	But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion 
LUK.10.34	and went to 
LUK.10.35	And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave 
LUK.10.36	Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves? 
LUK.10.37	And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
LUK.10.39	And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. 
LUK.10.41	And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: 
LUK.10.42	but one thing is needful; and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
LUK.11.1	And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. 
LUK.11.2	And he said unto them, When ye pray, say,
LUK.11.2	Our Father which art in heaven,
LUK.11.2	Hallowed be thy name.
LUK.11.2	Thy kingdom come.
LUK.11.2	Thy will be done,
LUK.11.2	as in heaven, so in earth.
LUK.11.3	Give us day by day our daily bread.
LUK.11.4	And forgive us our sins;
LUK.11.4	for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us.
LUK.11.4	And lead us not into temptation;
LUK.11.4	but deliver us from evil.
LUK.11.5	And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; 
LUK.11.6	for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him? 
LUK.11.7	And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. 
LUK.11.8	I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. 
LUK.11.9	And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 
LUK.11.10	For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 
LUK.11.11	If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if 
LUK.11.12	Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? 
LUK.11.13	If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children; how much more shall 
LUK.11.14	And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered. 
LUK.11.15	 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beel´zebub the chief of the devils. 
LUK.11.16	 And others, tempting 
LUK.11.17	But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house 
LUK.11.18	If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beel´zebub. 
LUK.11.19	And if I by Beel´zebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast 
LUK.11.20	But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you. 
LUK.11.21	When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace: 
LUK.11.22	but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. 
LUK.11.23	 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
LUK.11.24	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out. 
LUK.11.25	And when he cometh, he findeth 
LUK.11.26	Then goeth he, and taketh 
LUK.11.27	And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed 
LUK.11.28	But he said, Yea, rather, blessed 
LUK.11.30	 For as Jonah was a sign unto the Nin´evites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation. 
LUK.11.31	 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon 
LUK.11.32	 The men of Nin´eveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah 
LUK.11.34	The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when 
LUK.11.35	Take heed therefore, that the light which is in thee be not darkness. 
LUK.11.36	If thy whole body therefore 
LUK.11.37	And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. 
LUK.11.38	And when the Pharisee saw 
LUK.11.39	And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness. 
LUK.11.40	 fools, did not he, that made that which is without, make that which is within also? 
LUK.11.41	But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.
LUK.11.43	Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets. 
LUK.11.44	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over 
LUK.11.45	Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also. 
LUK.11.46	And he said, Woe unto you also, 
LUK.11.47	Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. 
LUK.11.48	Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres. 
LUK.11.49	Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and 
LUK.11.50	that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; 
LUK.11.51	 from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zechari´ah, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation. 
LUK.11.52	Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
LUK.11.53	And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge 
LUK.11.54	laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
LUK.12.2	 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known. 
LUK.12.3	Therefore, whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
LUK.12.4	And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. 
LUK.12.5	But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. 
LUK.12.6	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? 
LUK.12.7	But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
LUK.12.8	Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: 
LUK.12.9	but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God. 
LUK.12.10	 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven. 
LUK.12.11	 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and 
LUK.12.12	for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.
LUK.12.13	And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. 
LUK.12.14	And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? 
LUK.12.15	And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. 
LUK.12.16	And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 
LUK.12.17	and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? 
LUK.12.18	And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. 
LUK.12.19	And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, 
LUK.12.20	But God said unto him, 
LUK.12.21	So 
LUK.12.22	And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on. 
LUK.12.23	The life is more than meat, and the body 
LUK.12.24	Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls? 
LUK.12.25	And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? 
LUK.12.26	If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? 
LUK.12.27	 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
LUK.12.28	If then God so clothe the grass, which is today in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more 
LUK.12.29	And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. 
LUK.12.30	For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. 
LUK.12.31	But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.
LUK.12.32	Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. 
LUK.12.33	Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. 
LUK.12.34	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
LUK.12.36	 and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately. 
LUK.12.37	Blessed 
LUK.12.38	And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find 
LUK.12.39	 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through. 
LUK.12.40	Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.
LUK.12.41	Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all? 
LUK.12.42	And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom 
LUK.12.43	Blessed 
LUK.12.44	Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath. 
LUK.12.45	But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; 
LUK.12.46	the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for 
LUK.12.47	And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not 
LUK.12.48	But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few 
LUK.12.49	I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?
LUK.12.50	 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished! 
LUK.12.51	Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: 
LUK.12.52	for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. 
LUK.12.53	 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
LUK.12.54	And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is. 
LUK.12.55	And when 
LUK.12.56	 hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?
LUK.12.57	Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right? 
LUK.12.58	When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, 
LUK.12.59	I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.
LUK.13.1	There were present at that season some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 
LUK.13.2	And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things? 
LUK.13.3	I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. 
LUK.13.4	Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Silo´am fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? 
LUK.13.5	I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
LUK.13.6	He spake also this parable; A certain 
LUK.13.7	Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 
LUK.13.8	And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung 
LUK.13.9	and if it bear fruit, 
LUK.13.10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. 
LUK.13.11	And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up 
LUK.13.12	And when Jesus saw her, he called 
LUK.13.13	And he laid 
LUK.13.14	 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. 
LUK.13.15	The Lord then answered him, and said, 
LUK.13.16	And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? 
LUK.13.17	And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
LUK.13.18	Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? 
LUK.13.19	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.
LUK.13.20	And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? 
LUK.13.21	It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
LUK.13.22	And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.23	Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, 
LUK.13.24	Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. 
LUK.13.25	When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are: 
LUK.13.26	then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. 
LUK.13.27	 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all 
LUK.13.28	 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you 
LUK.13.29	And they shall come from the east, and 
LUK.13.30	 And, behold, there are last which shall be first; and there are first which shall be last.
LUK.13.31	The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence; for Herod will kill thee. 
LUK.13.32	And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures today and tomorrow, and the third 
LUK.13.33	Nevertheless I must walk today, and tomorrow, and the 
LUK.13.34	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen 
LUK.13.35	 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until 
LUK.14.1	And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. 
LUK.14.2	And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. 
LUK.14.3	And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? 
LUK.14.4	And they held their peace. And he took 
LUK.14.5	 and answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? 
LUK.14.6	And they could not answer him again to these things.
LUK.14.7	And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them, 
LUK.14.8	 When thou art bidden of any 
LUK.14.9	and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. 
LUK.14.10	But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. 
LUK.14.11	 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
LUK.14.12	Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor 
LUK.14.13	But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: 
LUK.14.14	and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
LUK.14.15	And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed 
LUK.14.16	Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: 
LUK.14.17	and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. 
LUK.14.18	And they all with one 
LUK.14.19	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. 
LUK.14.20	And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. 
LUK.14.21	So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. 
LUK.14.22	And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. 
LUK.14.23	And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel 
LUK.14.24	For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.
LUK.14.25	And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them, 
LUK.14.26	 If any 
LUK.14.27	 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. 
LUK.14.28	For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have 
LUK.14.29	Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish 
LUK.14.30	saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. 
LUK.14.31	Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? 
LUK.14.32	Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace. 
LUK.14.33	So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.
LUK.14.34	Salt 
LUK.14.35	It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; 
LUK.15.2	And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
LUK.15.3	And he spake this parable unto them, saying, 
LUK.15.4	What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? 
LUK.15.5	And when he hath found 
LUK.15.6	And when he cometh home, he calleth together 
LUK.15.7	I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.
LUK.15.8	Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find 
LUK.15.9	And when she hath found 
LUK.15.10	Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
LUK.15.11	And he said, A certain man had two sons: 
LUK.15.12	and the younger of them said to 
LUK.15.13	And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. 
LUK.15.14	And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. 
LUK.15.15	And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. 
LUK.15.16	And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. 
LUK.15.17	And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! 
LUK.15.18	I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, 
LUK.15.19	and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. 
LUK.15.20	And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. 
LUK.15.21	And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. 
LUK.15.22	But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put 
LUK.15.23	and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill 
LUK.15.24	for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
LUK.15.25	Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. 
LUK.15.26	And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. 
LUK.15.27	And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. 
LUK.15.28	And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him. 
LUK.15.29	And he answering said to 
LUK.15.30	but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. 
LUK.15.31	And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. 
LUK.15.32	It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.
LUK.16.1	And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. 
LUK.16.2	And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. 
LUK.16.3	Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. 
LUK.16.4	I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. 
LUK.16.5	So he called every one of his lord's debtors 
LUK.16.6	And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. 
LUK.16.7	Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. 
LUK.16.8	And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. 
LUK.16.9	And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye
LUK.16.10	He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. 
LUK.16.11	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true 
LUK.16.12	And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? 
LUK.16.13	 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
LUK.16.14	And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. 
LUK.16.15	And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
LUK.16.17	 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.
LUK.16.19	There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: 
LUK.16.20	and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, 
LUK.16.21	and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. 
LUK.16.22	And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; 
LUK.16.23	and in hell
LUK.16.24	And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. 
LUK.16.25	But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. 
LUK.16.26	And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that 
LUK.16.27	Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: 
LUK.16.28	for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. 
LUK.16.29	Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 
LUK.16.30	And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. 
LUK.16.31	And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
LUK.17.1	Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offenses will come: but woe 
LUK.17.2	It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones. 
LUK.17.3	 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,
LUK.17.4	And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
LUK.17.5	And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. 
LUK.17.6	And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.
LUK.17.7	But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? 
LUK.17.8	and will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? 
LUK.17.9	Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. 
LUK.17.10	So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.
LUK.17.11	And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. 
LUK.17.12	And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: 
LUK.17.13	and they lifted up 
LUK.17.14	 And when he saw 
LUK.17.15	And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, 
LUK.17.16	and fell down on 
LUK.17.17	And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where 
LUK.17.18	There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. 
LUK.17.19	And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.
LUK.17.20	And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: 
LUK.17.21	neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
LUK.17.22	And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see 
LUK.17.23	And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after 
LUK.17.24	For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one 
LUK.17.25	But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. 
LUK.17.26	 And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. 
LUK.17.27	 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. 
LUK.17.28	 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 
LUK.17.29	but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed 
LUK.17.30	Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. 
LUK.17.31	 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. 
LUK.17.32	 Remember Lot's wife. 
LUK.17.33	 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. 
LUK.17.34	I tell you, in that night there shall be two 
LUK.17.35	Two 
LUK.17.36	Two 
LUK.17.37	And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body 
LUK.18.1	And he spake a parable unto them 
LUK.18.2	saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: 
LUK.18.3	and there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. 
LUK.18.4	And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; 
LUK.18.5	yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. 
LUK.18.6	And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. 
LUK.18.7	And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? 
LUK.18.8	I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
LUK.18.9	And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 
LUK.18.10	Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 
LUK.18.11	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men 
LUK.18.12	I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. 
LUK.18.13	And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as 
LUK.18.14	 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified 
LUK.18.15	And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when 
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called them 
LUK.18.17	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
LUK.18.18	And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
LUK.18.19	And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none 
LUK.18.20	 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and thy mother. 
LUK.18.21	And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up. 
LUK.18.22	Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
LUK.18.23	And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. 
LUK.18.24	And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
LUK.18.25	For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
LUK.18.26	And they that heard 
LUK.18.27	And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. 
LUK.18.28	Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. 
LUK.18.29	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, 
LUK.18.30	who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
LUK.18.31	Then he took 
LUK.18.32	For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: 
LUK.18.33	and they shall scourge 
LUK.18.34	And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
LUK.18.35	And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging: 
LUK.18.36	and hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. 
LUK.18.37	And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. 
LUK.18.38	And he cried, saying, Jesus, 
LUK.18.39	And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, 
LUK.18.40	And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, 
LUK.18.41	saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. 
LUK.18.42	And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. 
LUK.18.43	And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw 
LUK.19.1	And 
LUK.19.2	And, behold, 
LUK.19.3	And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. 
LUK.19.4	And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him; for he was to pass that 
LUK.19.5	And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacche´us, make haste, and come down; for today I must abide at thy house. 
LUK.19.6	And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. 
LUK.19.7	And when they saw 
LUK.19.8	And Zacche´us stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore 
LUK.19.9	And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. 
LUK.19.10	 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
LUK.19.12	He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. 
LUK.19.13	And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come. 
LUK.19.14	But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this 
LUK.19.15	And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. 
LUK.19.16	Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. 
LUK.19.17	And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. 
LUK.19.18	And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. 
LUK.19.19	And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. 
LUK.19.20	And another came, saying, Lord, behold, 
LUK.19.21	for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. 
LUK.19.22	And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, 
LUK.19.23	wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? 
LUK.19.24	And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give 
LUK.19.25	(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) 
LUK.19.26	 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. 
LUK.19.27	But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay 
LUK.19.28	And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. 
LUK.19.29	And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called 
LUK.19.30	saying, Go ye into the village over against 
LUK.19.31	And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose 
LUK.19.32	And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. 
LUK.19.33	And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? 
LUK.19.34	And they said, The Lord hath need of him. 
LUK.19.35	And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. 
LUK.19.36	And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. 
LUK.19.37	And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen; 
LUK.19.38	 saying,
LUK.19.38	Blessed 
LUK.19.38	that cometh in the name of the Lord:
LUK.19.38	peace in heaven,
LUK.19.38	and glory in the highest.
LUK.19.39	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. 
LUK.19.40	And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.
LUK.19.41	And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, 
LUK.19.42	saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things 
LUK.19.43	For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, 
LUK.19.44	and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
LUK.19.45	And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; 
LUK.19.46	 saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
LUK.19.48	and could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
LUK.20.1	And it came to pass, 
LUK.20.2	and spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? 
LUK.20.3	And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: 
LUK.20.4	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? 
LUK.20.5	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not? 
LUK.20.6	But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet. 
LUK.20.7	And they answered, that they could not tell whence 
LUK.20.8	And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
LUK.20.10	And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent 
LUK.20.11	And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated 
LUK.20.12	And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast 
LUK.20.13	Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence 
LUK.20.14	But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. 
LUK.20.15	So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed 
LUK.20.16	He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard 
LUK.20.17	 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,
LUK.20.17	The stone which the builders rejected,
LUK.20.17	the same is become the head of the corner?
LUK.20.18	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
LUK.20.19	And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them. 
LUK.20.20	And they watched 
LUK.20.21	And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person 
LUK.20.22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? 
LUK.20.23	But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me? 
LUK.20.24	Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's. 
LUK.20.25	And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's. 
LUK.20.26	And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.
LUK.20.28	 saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
LUK.20.29	There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children. 
LUK.20.30	And the second took her to wife, and he died childless. 
LUK.20.31	And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died. 
LUK.20.32	Last of all the woman died also. 
LUK.20.33	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
LUK.20.34	And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: 
LUK.20.35	but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: 
LUK.20.36	neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. 
LUK.20.37	 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. 
LUK.20.38	For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. 
LUK.20.39	Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said. 
LUK.20.40	And after that they durst not ask him any 
LUK.20.41	And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son? 
LUK.20.42	 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms,
LUK.20.42	The 
LUK.20.42	Sit thou on my right hand,
LUK.20.43	till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
LUK.20.44	David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?
LUK.20.45	Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples, 
LUK.20.46	Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; 
LUK.20.47	which devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.
LUK.21.1	And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury. 
LUK.21.2	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. 
LUK.21.3	And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all: 
LUK.21.4	for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
LUK.21.5	And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said, 
LUK.21.6	 these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. 
LUK.21.7	And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign 
LUK.21.8	And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am 
LUK.21.9	But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end 
LUK.21.10	Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: 
LUK.21.11	and great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. 
LUK.21.12	But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute 
LUK.21.13	And it shall turn to you for a testimony. 
LUK.21.14	 Settle 
LUK.21.15	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. 
LUK.21.16	And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends; and 
LUK.21.17	And ye shall be hated of all 
LUK.21.18	But there shall not a hair of your head perish. 
LUK.21.19	In your patience possess ye your souls.
LUK.21.20	And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. 
LUK.21.21	Then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. 
LUK.21.22	 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. 
LUK.21.23	But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people. 
LUK.21.24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
LUK.21.26	men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. 
LUK.21.27	 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 
LUK.21.28	And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
LUK.21.29	And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; 
LUK.21.30	when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. 
LUK.21.31	So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. 
LUK.21.32	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled. 
LUK.21.33	Heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away.
LUK.21.34	And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and 
LUK.21.35	For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. 
LUK.21.36	Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
LUK.21.38	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.
LUK.22.2	And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
LUK.22.3	Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscar´i-ot, being of the number of the twelve. 
LUK.22.4	And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. 
LUK.22.5	And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
LUK.22.6	And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
LUK.22.7	Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed. 
LUK.22.8	And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat. 
LUK.22.9	And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? 
LUK.22.10	And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. 
LUK.22.11	And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? 
LUK.22.12	And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. 
LUK.22.13	And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
LUK.22.14	And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. 
LUK.22.15	And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: 
LUK.22.16	for I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. 
LUK.22.17	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide 
LUK.22.18	for I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. 
LUK.22.19	And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake 
LUK.22.20	 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup 
LUK.22.21	But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me 
LUK.22.22	 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! 
LUK.22.23	And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
LUK.22.25	 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. 
LUK.22.26	 But ye 
LUK.22.27	 For whether 
LUK.22.28	Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. 
LUK.22.29	And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; 
LUK.22.30	 that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
LUK.22.31	And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired 
LUK.22.32	but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. 
LUK.22.33	And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. 
LUK.22.34	And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
LUK.22.36	Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take 
LUK.22.37	 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
LUK.22.38	And they said, Lord, behold, here 
LUK.22.39	And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. 
LUK.22.40	And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. 
LUK.22.41	And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, 
LUK.22.42	saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done. 
LUK.22.43	And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 
LUK.22.44	And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. 
LUK.22.45	And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, 
LUK.22.46	and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
LUK.22.47	And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. 
LUK.22.48	But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? 
LUK.22.49	When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? 
LUK.22.50	And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. 
LUK.22.51	And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. 
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? 
LUK.22.53	 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
LUK.22.54	Then took they him, and led 
LUK.22.55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. 
LUK.22.56	But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. 
LUK.22.57	And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. 
LUK.22.58	And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. 
LUK.22.59	And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this 
LUK.22.60	And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. 
LUK.22.61	And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
LUK.22.62	And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.63	And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote 
LUK.22.64	And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? 
LUK.22.65	And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
LUK.22.66	And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, 
LUK.22.67	Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 
LUK.22.68	and if I also ask 
LUK.22.69	Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. 
LUK.22.70	Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. 
LUK.22.71	And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
LUK.23.1	And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. 
LUK.23.2	And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this 
LUK.23.3	And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest 
LUK.23.4	Then said Pilate to the chief priests and 
LUK.23.5	And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
LUK.23.6	When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean. 
LUK.23.7	And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. 
LUK.23.8	And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long 
LUK.23.9	Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 
LUK.23.10	And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. 
LUK.23.11	And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked 
LUK.23.12	And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together; for before they were at enmity between themselves.
LUK.23.13	And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
LUK.23.14	said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people; and, behold, I, having examined 
LUK.23.15	no, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto
LUK.23.16	I will therefore chastise him, and release 
LUK.23.17	(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
LUK.23.18	And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this 
LUK.23.19	(who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) 
LUK.23.20	Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. 
LUK.23.21	But they cried, saying, Crucify 
LUK.23.22	And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let 
LUK.23.23	And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified: and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. 
LUK.23.24	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 
LUK.23.25	And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
LUK.23.26	And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyre´nian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear 
LUK.23.27	And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. 
LUK.23.28	But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. 
LUK.23.29	For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed 
LUK.23.30	 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. 
LUK.23.31	For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
LUK.23.32	And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. 
LUK.23.33	And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. 
LUK.23.34	 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. 
LUK.23.35	And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided 
LUK.23.36	And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, 
LUK.23.37	and saying, If thou be the King of the Jews, save thyself. 
LUK.23.38	And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, 
LUK.23.39	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 
LUK.23.40	But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 
LUK.23.41	And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 
LUK.23.42	And he said unto Jesus, Lord,
LUK.23.43	And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.
LUK.23.44	And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth
LUK.23.45	 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. 
LUK.23.46	 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. 
LUK.23.47	Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. 
LUK.23.48	And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. 
LUK.23.49	 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
LUK.23.50	And, behold, 
LUK.23.51	(the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them:) 
LUK.23.52	This 
LUK.23.53	And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. 
LUK.23.54	And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. 
LUK.23.55	And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. 
LUK.23.56	 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
LUK.24.1	Now upon the first 
LUK.24.2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. 
LUK.24.3	And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
LUK.24.4	And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: 
LUK.24.5	and as they were afraid, and bowed down 
LUK.24.6	 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 
LUK.24.7	saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. 
LUK.24.8	And they remembered his words, 
LUK.24.9	and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. 
LUK.24.10	It was Mary Mag´dalene, and Joanna, and Mary 
LUK.24.11	And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. 
LUK.24.12	Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
LUK.24.13	And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emma´us, which was from Jerusalem 
LUK.24.14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 
LUK.24.15	And it came to pass, that, while they communed 
LUK.24.16	But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 
LUK.24.17	And he said unto them, What manner of communications 
LUK.24.18	And the one of them, whose name was Cle´opas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? 
LUK.24.19	And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 
LUK.24.20	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 
LUK.24.21	But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done. 
LUK.24.22	Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; 
LUK.24.23	and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. 
LUK.24.24	And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found 
LUK.24.25	Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: 
LUK.24.26	ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? 
LUK.24.27	And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
LUK.24.28	And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. 
LUK.24.29	But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. 
LUK.24.30	And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed 
LUK.24.31	And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 
LUK.24.32	And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures? 
LUK.24.33	And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 
LUK.24.34	saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 
LUK.24.35	And they told what things 
LUK.24.36	And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace 
LUK.24.37	But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 
LUK.24.38	And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? 
LUK.24.39	Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. 
LUK.24.40	And when he had thus spoken, he showed them 
LUK.24.41	And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? 
LUK.24.42	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of a honeycomb.
LUK.24.43	And he took 
LUK.24.44	And he said unto them, These 
LUK.24.45	Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, 
LUK.24.46	 and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 
LUK.24.47	and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 
LUK.24.48	And ye are witnesses of these things. 
LUK.24.49	 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
LUK.24.51	And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. 
LUK.24.52	And they worshipped him, and
LUK.24.53	and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
JHN.1.2	The same was in the beginning with God. 
JHN.1.3	All things were made by
JHN.1.4	In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 
JHN.1.5	And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
JHN.1.7	The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all 
JHN.1.8	He was not that Light, but 
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world was made by
JHN.1.11	He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 
JHN.1.12	But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, 
JHN.1.13	which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
JHN.1.14	And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. 
JHN.1.15	John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me; for he was before me. 
JHN.1.16	And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. 
JHN.1.17	For the law was given by Moses, 
JHN.1.18	No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared 
JHN.1.19	And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? 
JHN.1.20	And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. 
JHN.1.21	 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Eli´jah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that Prophet? And he answered, No. 
JHN.1.22	Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? 
JHN.1.23	 He said, I 
JHN.1.23	the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
JHN.1.23	Make straight the way of the Lord,
JHN.1.23	as said the prophet Isaiah.
JHN.1.24	And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. 
JHN.1.25	And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Eli´jah, neither that Prophet? 
JHN.1.26	John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; 
JHN.1.27	he it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose. 
JHN.1.28	These things were done in Bethab´ara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
JHN.1.29	The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world! 
JHN.1.30	This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me; for he was before me. 
JHN.1.31	And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. 
JHN.1.32	And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. 
JHN.1.33	And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. 
JHN.1.34	And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
JHN.1.35	Again the next day after, John stood, and two of his disciples; 
JHN.1.36	and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! 
JHN.1.37	And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.38	Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? 
JHN.1.39	He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. 
JHN.1.40	One of the two which heard John 
JHN.1.41	He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
JHN.1.42	And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
JHN.1.43	The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. 
JHN.1.44	Now Philip was of Bethsai´da, the city of Andrew and Peter. 
JHN.1.45	Philip findeth Nathan´a-el, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 
JHN.1.46	And Nathan´a-el said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. 
JHN.1.47	Jesus saw Nathan´a-el coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! 
JHN.1.48	Nathan´a-el saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. 
JHN.1.49	Nathan´a-el answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. 
JHN.1.50	Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. 
JHN.1.51	 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
JHN.2.1	And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: 
JHN.2.2	and both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. 
JHN.2.3	And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. 
JHN.2.4	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 
JHN.2.5	His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do 
JHN.2.6	And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. 
JHN.2.7	Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 
JHN.2.8	And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare 
JHN.2.9	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servants which drew the water knew,) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, 
JHN.2.10	and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: 
JHN.2.11	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
JHN.2.14	and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 
JHN.2.15	and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; 
JHN.2.16	and said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. 
JHN.2.17	 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. 
JHN.2.18	Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? 
JHN.2.19	 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 
JHN.2.20	Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? 
JHN.2.21	But he spake of the temple of his body. 
JHN.2.22	When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
JHN.2.23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast 
JHN.2.24	But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all 
JHN.2.25	and needed not that any should testify of man; for he knew what was in man.
JHN.3.1	There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicode´mus, a ruler of the Jews: 
JHN.3.2	the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. 
JHN.3.3	Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again,
JHN.3.4	Nicode´mus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? 
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and 
JHN.3.6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 
JHN.3.7	Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
JHN.3.8	The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. 
JHN.3.9	Nicode´mus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 
JHN.3.10	Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? 
JHN.3.11	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. 
JHN.3.12	If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you 
JHN.3.13	And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, 
JHN.3.14	 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 
JHN.3.15	that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
JHN.3.16	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 
JHN.3.17	For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 
JHN.3.18	He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 
JHN.3.19	And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 
JHN.3.20	For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 
JHN.3.21	But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
JHN.3.22	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. 
JHN.3.23	And John also was baptizing in Ae´non near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. 
JHN.3.24	 For John was not yet cast into prison.
JHN.3.25	Then there arose a question between 
JHN.3.26	And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all 
JHN.3.27	John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. 
JHN.3.28	 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. 
JHN.3.29	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. 
JHN.3.30	He must increase, but I 
JHN.3.31	He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. 
JHN.3.32	And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. 
JHN.3.33	He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true. 
JHN.3.34	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure 
JHN.3.35	 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. 
JHN.3.36	He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
JHN.4.1	When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 
JHN.4.2	(though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 
JHN.4.3	he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee. 
JHN.4.4	And he must needs go through Samaria. 
JHN.4.5	 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
JHN.4.6	Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with 
JHN.4.7	There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 
JHN.4.8	(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 
JHN.4.9	 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. 
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
JHN.4.11	The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 
JHN.4.12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 
JHN.4.14	but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. 
JHN.4.15	The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
JHN.4.16	Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
JHN.4.17	The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: 
JHN.4.18	for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 
JHN.4.19	The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
JHN.4.21	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 
JHN.4.22	Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship; for salvation is of the Jews. 
JHN.4.23	But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 
JHN.4.24	God 
JHN.4.25	The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 
JHN.4.26	Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am 
JHN.4.27	And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? 
JHN.4.28	The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, 
JHN.4.29	Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? 
JHN.4.30	Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
JHN.4.31	In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. 
JHN.4.32	But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. 
JHN.4.33	Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him 
JHN.4.34	Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 
JHN.4.35	Say not ye, There are yet four months, and 
JHN.4.36	And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. 
JHN.4.37	And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. 
JHN.4.38	I sent you to reap that whereupon ye bestowed no labor: other men labored, and ye are entered into their labors.
JHN.4.39	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. 
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 
JHN.4.41	And many more believed because of his own word; 
JHN.4.42	and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard 
JHN.4.43	Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country. 
JHN.4.45	 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
JHN.4.47	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 
JHN.4.48	Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. 
JHN.4.49	The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 
JHN.4.50	Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 
JHN.4.51	And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told 
JHN.4.52	Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
JHN.4.53	So the father knew that 
JHN.4.54	This 
JHN.5.1	After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
JHN.5.2	Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep 
JHN.5.3	In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 
JHN.5.4	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
JHN.5.5	And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time 
JHN.5.7	The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. 
JHN.5.8	Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. 
JHN.5.9	And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
JHN.5.11	He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 
JHN.5.12	Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? 
JHN.5.13	And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in 
JHN.5.14	Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. 
JHN.5.15	The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. 
JHN.5.16	And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 
JHN.5.17	But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. 
JHN.5.18	Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
JHN.5.19	Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 
JHN.5.20	For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. 
JHN.5.21	For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth 
JHN.5.22	For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: 
JHN.5.23	that all 
JHN.5.24	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
JHN.5.25	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. 
JHN.5.26	For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 
JHN.5.27	and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. 
JHN.5.28	Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, 
JHN.5.29	 and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
JHN.5.30	I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. 
JHN.5.31	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 
JHN.5.32	There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 
JHN.5.33	 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. 
JHN.5.34	But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. 
JHN.5.35	He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. 
JHN.5.36	But I have greater witness than 
JHN.5.37	 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. 
JHN.5.38	And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. 
JHN.5.39	Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. 
JHN.5.40	And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. 
JHN.5.41	I receive not honor from men. 
JHN.5.42	But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 
JHN.5.43	I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. 
JHN.5.44	How can ye believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that 
JHN.5.45	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is 
JHN.5.46	For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. 
JHN.5.47	But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
JHN.6.1	After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is 
JHN.6.2	And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased. 
JHN.6.3	And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 
JHN.6.4	And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. 
JHN.6.5	When Jesus then lifted up 
JHN.6.6	And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. 
JHN.6.7	Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. 
JHN.6.8	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, 
JHN.6.9	There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? 
JHN.6.10	And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 
JHN.6.11	And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. 
JHN.6.12	When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. 
JHN.6.13	Therefore they gathered 
JHN.6.14	Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the world.
JHN.6.15	When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
JHN.6.16	And when even was 
JHN.6.17	and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Caper´na-um. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. 
JHN.6.18	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. 
JHN.6.19	So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid. 
JHN.6.20	But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid. 
JHN.6.21	Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
JHN.6.22	The day following, when the people, which stood on the other side of the sea, saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but 
JHN.6.23	(howbeit there came other boats from Tibe´ri-as nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) 
JHN.6.24	when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Caper´na-um, seeking for Jesus.
JHN.6.25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? 
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. 
JHN.6.27	Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. 
JHN.6.28	Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? 
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. 
JHN.6.30	They said therefore unto him, What sign showest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work? 
JHN.6.31	 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. 
JHN.6.32	Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. 
JHN.6.33	For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. 
JHN.6.34	Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
JHN.6.35	And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. 
JHN.6.36	But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. 
JHN.6.37	All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. 
JHN.6.38	For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. 
JHN.6.39	And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. 
JHN.6.40	And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
JHN.6.41	The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. 
JHN.6.42	And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven? 
JHN.6.43	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. 
JHN.6.44	No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. 
JHN.6.45	 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. 
JHN.6.46	Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father. 
JHN.6.47	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. 
JHN.6.48	I am that bread of life. 
JHN.6.49	Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. 
JHN.6.50	This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. 
JHN.6.51	I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
JHN.6.52	The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us 
JHN.6.53	Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 
JHN.6.54	Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. 
JHN.6.55	For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 
JHN.6.56	He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. 
JHN.6.57	As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. 
JHN.6.58	This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. 
JHN.6.59	These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Caper´na-um.
JHN.6.60	Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard 
JHN.6.61	When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you? 
JHN.6.62	 and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? 
JHN.6.63	It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, 
JHN.6.64	But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. 
JHN.6.65	And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.
JHN.6.66	From that 
JHN.6.67	Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? 
JHN.6.68	 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. 
JHN.6.69	And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. 
JHN.6.70	Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? 
JHN.6.71	He spake of Judas Iscar´i-ot 
JHN.7.1	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
JHN.7.2	 Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
JHN.7.3	His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. 
JHN.7.4	For 
JHN.7.5	For neither did his brethren believe in him. 
JHN.7.6	Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready. 
JHN.7.7	The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. 
JHN.7.8	Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come. 
JHN.7.9	When he had said these words unto them, he abode 
JHN.7.10	But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
JHN.7.11	Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 
JHN.7.12	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. 
JHN.7.13	Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
JHN.7.14	Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 
JHN.7.15	And the Jews marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? 
JHN.7.16	Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 
JHN.7.17	If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or 
JHN.7.18	He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 
JHN.7.19	Did not Moses give you the law, and 
JHN.7.20	The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? 
JHN.7.21	Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. 
JHN.7.22	 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. 
JHN.7.23	 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? 
JHN.7.24	Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
JHN.7.25	Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? 
JHN.7.26	But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? 
JHN.7.27	Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. 
JHN.7.28	Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. 
JHN.7.29	But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent me. 
JHN.7.30	Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. 
JHN.7.31	And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this 
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. 
JHN.7.33	Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and 
JHN.7.34	Ye shall seek me, and shall not find 
JHN.7.35	Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles,
JHN.7.36	What 
JHN.7.38	 He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. 
JHN.7.39	(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet 
JHN.7.40	Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. 
JHN.7.41	Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? 
JHN.7.42	 Hath not the Scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? 
JHN.7.43	So there was a division among the people because of him. 
JHN.7.44	And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
JHN.7.45	Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 
JHN.7.46	The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. 
JHN.7.47	Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? 
JHN.7.48	Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? 
JHN.7.49	But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. 
JHN.7.50	 Nicode´mus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) 
JHN.7.51	Doth our law judge 
JHN.7.52	They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
JHN.8.1	Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
JHN.8.2	And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 
JHN.8.3	And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 
JHN.8.4	they say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 
JHN.8.5	 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? 
JHN.8.6	This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with 
JHN.8.7	So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 
JHN.8.8	And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 
JHN.8.9	And they which heard 
JHN.8.10	When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 
JHN.8.11	She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
JHN.8.13	 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. 
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, 
JHN.8.15	Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. 
JHN.8.16	And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. 
JHN.8.17	It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. 
JHN.8.18	I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. 
JHN.8.19	Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. 
JHN.8.20	These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
JHN.8.21	Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. 
JHN.8.22	Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. 
JHN.8.23	And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. 
JHN.8.24	I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am 
JHN.8.25	Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even 
JHN.8.26	I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. 
JHN.8.27	They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. 
JHN.8.28	Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am 
JHN.8.29	And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. 
JHN.8.30	As he spake these words, many believed on him.
JHN.8.31	Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, 
JHN.8.32	and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. 
JHN.8.33	 They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
JHN.8.34	Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. 
JHN.8.35	And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: 
JHN.8.36	If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. 
JHN.8.37	I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. 
JHN.8.38	I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
JHN.8.39	They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. 
JHN.8.40	But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. 
JHN.8.41	Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, 
JHN.8.42	Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. 
JHN.8.43	Why do ye not understand my speech? 
JHN.8.44	Ye are of 
JHN.8.45	And because I tell 
JHN.8.46	Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? 
JHN.8.47	He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear 
JHN.8.48	Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 
JHN.8.49	Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honor my Father, and ye do dishonor me. 
JHN.8.50	And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. 
JHN.8.51	Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. 
JHN.8.52	Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. 
JHN.8.53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? 
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered, If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honoreth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: 
JHN.8.55	yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. 
JHN.8.56	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw 
JHN.8.57	Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 
JHN.8.58	Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. 
JHN.8.59	Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
JHN.9.1	And as 
JHN.9.2	And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 
JHN.9.3	Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
JHN.9.4	I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. 
JHN.9.5	 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 
JHN.9.6	When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, 
JHN.9.7	and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Silo´am, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. 
JHN.9.8	The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? 
JHN.9.9	Some said, This is he: others 
JHN.9.10	Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? 
JHN.9.11	He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Silo´am, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. 
JHN.9.12	Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
JHN.9.13	They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 
JHN.9.14	And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
JHN.9.15	Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. 
JHN.9.16	Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. 
JHN.9.17	They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
JHN.9.18	But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. 
JHN.9.19	And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? 
JHN.9.20	His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 
JHN.9.21	but by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. 
JHN.9.22	These 
JHN.9.23	Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
JHN.9.24	Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. 
JHN.9.25	He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner 
JHN.9.26	Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? 
JHN.9.27	He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear 
JHN.9.28	Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. 
JHN.9.29	We know that God spake unto Moses: 
JHN.9.30	The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvelous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and 
JHN.9.31	Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. 
JHN.9.32	Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. 
JHN.9.33	If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. 
JHN.9.34	They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
JHN.9.36	He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? 
JHN.9.37	And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. 
JHN.9.38	And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. 
JHN.9.39	And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. 
JHN.9.40	And 
JHN.9.41	Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.
JHN.10.1	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. 
JHN.10.2	But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
JHN.10.3	To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 
JHN.10.4	And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 
JHN.10.5	And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers. 
JHN.10.6	This parable spake Jesus unto them; but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
JHN.10.7	Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 
JHN.10.8	All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. 
JHN.10.9	I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. 
JHN.10.10	The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have 
JHN.10.11	I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.12	But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. 
JHN.10.13	The hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep. 
JHN.10.14	I am the good shepherd, and know my 
JHN.10.15	 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.16	And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold,
JHN.10.17	Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. 
JHN.10.18	No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
JHN.10.19	There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. 
JHN.10.20	And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? 
JHN.10.21	Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
JHN.10.22	And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. 
JHN.10.23	And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. 
JHN.10.24	Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. 
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. 
JHN.10.26	But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. 
JHN.10.27	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 
JHN.10.28	and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any 
JHN.10.29	My Father, which gave 
JHN.10.30	I and 
JHN.10.31	Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 
JHN.10.32	Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 
JHN.10.33	 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. 
JHN.10.34	 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? 
JHN.10.35	If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken; 
JHN.10.36	say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? 
JHN.10.37	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 
JHN.10.38	But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe
JHN.10.39	Therefore they sought again to take him; but he escaped out of their hand, 
JHN.10.40	 and went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. 
JHN.10.41	And many resorted unto him and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. 
JHN.10.42	And many believed on him there.
JHN.11.2	 (It was 
JHN.11.3	Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. 
JHN.11.4	When Jesus heard 
JHN.11.5	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 
JHN.11.6	When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. 
JHN.11.7	Then after that saith he to 
JHN.11.8	 disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? 
JHN.11.9	Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. 
JHN.11.10	But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. 
JHN.11.11	These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. 
JHN.11.12	Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. 
JHN.11.13	Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. 
JHN.11.14	Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 
JHN.11.15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. 
JHN.11.16	Then said Thomas, which is called Did´ymus, unto his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
JHN.11.17	Then when Jesus came, he found that he had 
JHN.11.18	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs
JHN.11.19	and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. 
JHN.11.20	Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat 
JHN.11.21	Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
JHN.11.22	But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give 
JHN.11.23	Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. 
JHN.11.24	Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 
JHN.11.25	Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 
JHN.11.26	and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? 
JHN.11.27	She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
JHN.11.28	And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. 
JHN.11.29	As soon as she heard 
JHN.11.30	Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 
JHN.11.31	The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. 
JHN.11.32	Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
JHN.11.33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, 
JHN.11.34	and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see. 
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept. 
JHN.11.36	Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 
JHN.11.37	And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
JHN.11.38	Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. 
JHN.11.39	Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been 
JHN.11.40	Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? 
JHN.11.41	Then they took away the stone 
JHN.11.42	And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said 
JHN.11.43	And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 
JHN.11.44	And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
JHN.11.45	Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. 
JHN.11.47	Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. 
JHN.11.48	If we let him thus alone, all 
JHN.11.49	And one of them, 
JHN.11.50	nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. 
JHN.11.51	And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; 
JHN.11.52	and not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. 
JHN.11.53	Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
JHN.11.54	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called E´phra-im, and there continued with his disciples.
JHN.11.55	And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. 
JHN.11.56	Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? 
JHN.11.57	Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show 
JHN.12.1	Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.2	There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. 
JHN.12.3	 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. 
JHN.12.4	Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscar´i-ot, Simon's 
JHN.12.5	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 
JHN.12.6	This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare
JHN.12.7	Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. 
JHN.12.8	 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
JHN.12.9	Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.10	But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 
JHN.12.11	because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
JHN.12.12	On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
JHN.12.13	 took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried,
JHN.12.13	Hosanna:
JHN.12.13	Blessed 
JHN.12.13	that cometh in the name of the Lord.
JHN.12.14	And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
JHN.12.15	behold, thy King cometh,
JHN.12.15	sitting on an ass's colt.
JHN.12.16	These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and 
JHN.12.17	The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. 
JHN.12.18	For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. 
JHN.12.19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
JHN.12.20	And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: 
JHN.12.21	the same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsai´da of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. 
JHN.12.22	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. 
JHN.12.23	And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. 
JHN.12.24	Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. 
JHN.12.25	 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. 
JHN.12.26	If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will 
JHN.12.27	Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. 
JHN.12.28	Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, 
JHN.12.29	The people therefore that stood by, and heard 
JHN.12.30	Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. 
JHN.12.31	Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. 
JHN.12.32	And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all 
JHN.12.33	This he said, signifying what death he should die. 
JHN.12.34	 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? 
JHN.12.35	Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 
JHN.12.36	While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.
JHN.12.36	These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. 
JHN.12.37	But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: 
JHN.12.38	 that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake,
JHN.12.38	Lord, who hath believed our report?
JHN.12.38	and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
JHN.12.39	Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again,
JHN.12.40	that they should not see with 
JHN.12.40	nor understand with 
JHN.12.40	and be converted, and I should heal them.
JHN.12.41	These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. 
JHN.12.42	Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess 
JHN.12.43	for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
JHN.12.44	Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. 
JHN.12.45	And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. 
JHN.12.46	I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. 
JHN.12.47	And if any man hear my words, and believe
JHN.12.48	He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. 
JHN.12.49	For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. 
JHN.12.50	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
JHN.13.1	Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 
JHN.13.2	And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscar´i-ot, Simon's 
JHN.13.3	Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
JHN.13.4	he riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. 
JHN.13.5	After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe 
JHN.13.6	Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 
JHN.13.8	Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also 
JHN.13.10	Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash 
JHN.13.11	For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
JHN.13.13	Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for 
JHN.13.14	If I then, 
JHN.13.15	For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. 
JHN.13.16	 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. 
JHN.13.17	If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. 
JHN.13.18	 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the Scripture may be fulfilled,
JHN.13.18	He that eateth bread with me
JHN.13.18	hath lifted up his heel against me.
JHN.13.19	Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am 
JHN.13.20	 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
JHN.13.21	When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
JHN.13.22	Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. 
JHN.13.23	Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. 
JHN.13.25	He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 
JHN.13.26	Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped 
JHN.13.27	And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. 
JHN.13.28	Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. 
JHN.13.29	For some 
JHN.13.30	He then, having received the sop, went immediately out; and it was night.
JHN.13.31	Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
JHN.13.32	If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. 
JHN.13.33	 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me; and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. 
JHN.13.34	 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 
JHN.13.35	By this shall all 
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterward. 
JHN.13.37	Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. 
JHN.13.38	Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
JHN.14.1	Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 
JHN.14.2	In my Father's house are many mansions: if 
JHN.14.3	And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, 
JHN.14.4	And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. 
JHN.14.5	Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 
JHN.14.6	Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 
JHN.14.7	If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
JHN.14.8	Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 
JHN.14.9	Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou 
JHN.14.10	Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 
JHN.14.11	Believe me that I 
JHN.14.12	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater 
JHN.14.13	And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
JHN.14.14	If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do 
JHN.14.15	If ye love me, keep my commandments. 
JHN.14.16	And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; 
JHN.14.17	 the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
JHN.14.18	I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. 
JHN.14.19	Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. 
JHN.14.20	At that day ye shall know that I 
JHN.14.21	He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. 
JHN.14.22	Judas saith unto him, not Iscar´i-ot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 
JHN.14.23	Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. 
JHN.14.24	He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.
JHN.14.25	These things have I spoken unto you, being 
JHN.14.26	But the Comforter, 
JHN.14.27	Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 
JHN.14.28	Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come 
JHN.14.29	And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe. 
JHN.14.30	Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 
JHN.14.31	But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
JHN.15.1	I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 
JHN.15.2	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every 
JHN.15.3	Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. 
JHN.15.4	Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 
JHN.15.5	I am the vine, ye 
JHN.15.6	If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast 
JHN.15.7	If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. 
JHN.15.8	Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. 
JHN.15.9	As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. 
JHN.15.10	If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. 
JHN.15.11	These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and 
JHN.15.13	Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 
JHN.15.14	Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. 
JHN.15.15	Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. 
JHN.15.16	Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and 
JHN.15.17	These things I command you, that ye love one another.
JHN.15.18	If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before 
JHN.15.19	If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. 
JHN.15.20	 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. 
JHN.15.21	But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. 
JHN.15.22	If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin. 
JHN.15.23	He that hateth me hateth my Father also. 
JHN.15.24	If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. 
JHN.15.25	 But 
JHN.15.26	But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, 
JHN.15.27	and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
JHN.16.1	These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. 
JHN.16.2	They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. 
JHN.16.3	And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. 
JHN.16.4	But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.
JHN.16.4	And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. 
JHN.16.5	But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? 
JHN.16.6	But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. 
JHN.16.7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. 
JHN.16.8	And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: 
JHN.16.9	of sin, because they believe not on me; 
JHN.16.10	of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; 
JHN.16.11	of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
JHN.16.12	I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. 
JHN.16.13	Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, 
JHN.16.14	He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show 
JHN.16.15	All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show 
JHN.16.16	A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. 
JHN.16.17	Then said 
JHN.16.18	They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. 
JHN.16.19	Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? 
JHN.16.20	Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. 
JHN.16.21	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. 
JHN.16.22	And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. 
JHN.16.23	And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give 
JHN.16.24	Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
JHN.16.25	These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,
JHN.16.26	At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: 
JHN.16.27	for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. 
JHN.16.28	I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
JHN.16.29	His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.
JHN.16.30	Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. 
JHN.16.31	Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 
JHN.16.32	Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 
JHN.16.33	These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
JHN.17.1	These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: 
JHN.17.2	as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. 
JHN.17.3	And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. 
JHN.17.4	I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. 
JHN.17.5	And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
JHN.17.6	I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. 
JHN.17.7	Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. 
JHN.17.8	For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received 
JHN.17.9	I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. 
JHN.17.10	And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. 
JHN.17.11	And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we 
JHN.17.12	 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled. 
JHN.17.13	And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. 
JHN.17.14	I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
JHN.17.15	I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. 
JHN.17.16	They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
JHN.17.17	Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. 
JHN.17.18	As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. 
JHN.17.19	And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.
JHN.17.20	Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; 
JHN.17.21	that they all may be one; as thou, Father, 
JHN.17.22	And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: 
JHN.17.23	I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. 
JHN.17.24	Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. 
JHN.17.25	O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. 
JHN.17.26	And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare 
JHN.18.1	When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. 
JHN.18.2	And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. 
JHN.18.3	Judas then, having received a band 
JHN.18.4	Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? 
JHN.18.5	They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am 
JHN.18.6	As soon then as he had said unto them, I am 
JHN.18.7	Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. 
JHN.18.8	Jesus answered, I have told you that I am 
JHN.18.9	that the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none. 
JHN.18.10	Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. 
JHN.18.11	 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
JHN.18.12	Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, 
JHN.18.13	and led him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law to Cai´aphas, which was the high priest that same year. 
JHN.18.14	 Now Cai´aphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
JHN.18.15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and 
JHN.18.16	But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. 
JHN.18.17	Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also 
JHN.18.18	And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals, for it was cold; and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
JHN.18.19	The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. 
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. 
JHN.18.21	Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. 
JHN.18.22	And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 
JHN.18.23	Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? 
JHN.18.24	Now Annas had sent him
JHN.18.25	And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also 
JHN.18.26	One of the servants of the high priest, being 
JHN.18.27	Peter then denied again; and immediately the cock crew.
JHN.18.28	Then led they Jesus from Cai´aphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. 
JHN.18.29	Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? 
JHN.18.30	They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. 
JHN.18.31	Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: 
JHN.18.32	 that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
JHN.18.33	Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 
JHN.18.34	Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? 
JHN.18.35	Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? 
JHN.18.36	Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. 
JHN.18.37	Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. 
JHN.18.38	Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?
JHN.18.38	And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault 
JHN.18.39	But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
JHN.18.40	Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barab´bas. Now Barab´bas was a robber.
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged 
JHN.19.2	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put 
JHN.19.3	and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. 
JHN.19.4	Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. 
JHN.19.5	Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And 
JHN.19.6	When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify 
JHN.19.7	The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. 
JHN.19.8	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; 
JHN.19.9	and went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. 
JHN.19.10	Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? 
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power 
JHN.19.12	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. 
JHN.19.13	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gab´batha. 
JHN.19.14	And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! 
JHN.19.15	But they cried out, Away with 
JHN.19.16	Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led 
JHN.19.17	And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called 
JHN.19.18	where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. 
JHN.19.19	And Pilate wrote a title, and put 
JHN.19.20	This title then read many of the Jews; for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, 
JHN.19.21	Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 
JHN.19.22	Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
JHN.19.23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also 
JHN.19.24	 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which saith,
JHN.19.24	They parted my raiment among them,
JHN.19.24	and for my vesture they did cast lots.
JHN.19.24	These things therefore the soldiers did.
JHN.19.25	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the 
JHN.19.26	When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! 
JHN.19.27	Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own 
JHN.19.29	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put 
JHN.19.30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
JHN.19.31	The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was a high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and 
JHN.19.32	Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. 
JHN.19.33	But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: 
JHN.19.34	but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. 
JHN.19.35	And he that saw 
JHN.19.36	 For these things were done, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. 
JHN.19.37	 And again another Scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
JHN.19.38	And after this Joseph of Arimathe´a, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave 
JHN.19.39	 And there came also Nicode´mus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound 
JHN.19.40	Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 
JHN.19.41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. 
JHN.19.42	There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation 
JHN.20.1	The first 
JHN.20.2	Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. 
JHN.20.3	Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. 
JHN.20.4	So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. 
JHN.20.5	And he stooping down, 
JHN.20.6	Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, 
JHN.20.7	and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. 
JHN.20.8	Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. 
JHN.20.9	For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. 
JHN.20.10	Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
JHN.20.11	But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, 
JHN.20.12	and seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
JHN.20.13	And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. 
JHN.20.14	And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 
JHN.20.15	Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 
JHN.20.16	Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabbo´ni; which is to say, Master. 
JHN.20.17	Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and 
JHN.20.18	Mary Mag´dalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and 
JHN.20.19	Then the same day at evening, being the first 
JHN.20.20	And when he had so said, he showed unto them 
JHN.20.21	Then said Jesus to them again, Peace 
JHN.20.22	And when he had said this, he breathed on 
JHN.20.23	 whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; 
JHN.20.24	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Did´ymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 
JHN.20.25	The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
JHN.20.26	And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: 
JHN.20.27	Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust 
JHN.20.28	And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. 
JHN.20.29	Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed:
JHN.20.30	And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: 
JHN.20.31	but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
JHN.21.1	After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tibe´ri-as; and on this wise showed he 
JHN.21.2	There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Did´ymus, and Nathan´a-el of Cana in Galilee, and the 
JHN.21.3	 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
JHN.21.4	But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. 
JHN.21.5	Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. 
JHN.21.6	 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. 
JHN.21.7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt 
JHN.21.8	And the other disciples came in a little ship, (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
JHN.21.9	As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. 
JHN.21.10	Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. 
JHN.21.11	Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken. 
JHN.21.12	Jesus saith unto them, Come 
JHN.21.13	Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. 
JHN.21.14	This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
JHN.21.15	So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, 
JHN.21.16	He saith to him again the second time, Simon, 
JHN.21.17	He saith unto him the third time, Simon, 
JHN.21.18	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry 
JHN.21.19	This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
JHN.21.21	Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what 
JHN.21.22	Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what 
JHN.21.23	Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what 
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
JHN.21.25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
ACT.1.2	until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen: 
ACT.1.3	to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: 
ACT.1.4	 and, being assembled together with 
ACT.1.5	 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.
ACT.1.6	When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? 
ACT.1.7	And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. 
ACT.1.8	 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. 
ACT.1.9	 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 
ACT.1.10	And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; 
ACT.1.11	which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
ACT.1.12	Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Ol´ivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. 
ACT.1.13	 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James 
ACT.1.14	These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
ACT.1.15	And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about a hundred and twenty,) 
ACT.1.16	Men 
ACT.1.17	For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry. 
ACT.1.18	 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. 
ACT.1.19	And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called, in their proper tongue, Acel´dama, that is to say, The field of blood. 
ACT.1.20	 For it is written in the book of Psalms,
ACT.1.20	Let his habitation be desolate,
ACT.1.20	and let no man dwell therein:
ACT.1.20	and,
ACT.1.20	His bishopric let another take.
ACT.1.21	Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 
ACT.1.22	 beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection. 
ACT.1.23	And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthi´as. 
ACT.1.24	And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all 
ACT.1.25	that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. 
ACT.1.26	And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthi´as; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
ACT.2.2	And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. 
ACT.2.3	And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. 
ACT.2.4	And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
ACT.2.5	And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. 
ACT.2.6	Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. 
ACT.2.7	And they were all amazed and marveled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galileans? 
ACT.2.8	And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? 
ACT.2.9	Par´thi-ans, and Medes, and E´lamites, and the dwellers in Mesopota´mi-a, and in Judea, and Cappado´cia, in Pontus, and Asia, 
ACT.2.10	Phryg´i-a, and Pamphyl´i-a, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyre´ne, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, 
ACT.2.11	Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. 
ACT.2.12	And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this? 
ACT.2.13	Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.
ACT.2.14	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judea, and all 
ACT.2.15	for these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is 
ACT.2.16	But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;
ACT.2.17	I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh:
ACT.2.17	and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
ACT.2.17	and your young men shall see visions,
ACT.2.17	and your old men shall dream dreams:
ACT.2.18	and on my servants and on my handmaidens
ACT.2.18	I will pour out in those days of my Spirit;
ACT.2.18	and they shall prophesy:
ACT.2.19	and I will show wonders in heaven above,
ACT.2.19	and signs in the earth beneath;
ACT.2.19	blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:
ACT.2.20	the sun shall be turned into darkness,
ACT.2.20	and the moon into blood,
ACT.2.20	before that great and notable day of the Lord come:
ACT.2.21	and it shall come to pass, 
ACT.2.22	Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: 
ACT.2.23	 him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: 
ACT.2.24	 whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. 
ACT.2.25	 For David speaketh concerning him,
ACT.2.25	I foresaw the Lord always before my face;
ACT.2.25	for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
ACT.2.26	therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
ACT.2.26	moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
ACT.2.27	because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,
ACT.2.27	neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
ACT.2.28	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life;
ACT.2.28	thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
ACT.2.29	Men 
ACT.2.30	 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; 
ACT.2.31	he, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell,
ACT.2.32	This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. 
ACT.2.33	Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. 
ACT.2.34	 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself,
ACT.2.34	The 
ACT.2.34	Sit thou on my right hand,
ACT.2.35	until I make thy foes thy footstool.
ACT.2.36	Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
ACT.2.37	Now when they heard 
ACT.2.38	Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
ACT.2.39	For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, 
ACT.2.40	And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. 
ACT.2.41	Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added 
ACT.2.42	And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
ACT.2.43	And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. 
ACT.2.44	 And all that believed were together, and had all things common; 
ACT.2.45	 and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all 
ACT.2.46	And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, 
ACT.2.47	praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
ACT.3.1	Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, 
ACT.3.2	And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 
ACT.3.3	who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked an alms. 
ACT.3.4	And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. 
ACT.3.5	And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. 
ACT.3.6	Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. 
ACT.3.7	And he took him by the right hand, and lifted 
ACT.3.8	And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. 
ACT.3.9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 
ACT.3.10	and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
ACT.3.11	And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. 
ACT.3.12	And when Peter saw 
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son
ACT.3.14	 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; 
ACT.3.15	and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. 
ACT.3.16	And his name, through faith in his name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
ACT.3.17	And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did 
ACT.3.18	But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled. 
ACT.3.19	Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; 
ACT.3.20	and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: 
ACT.3.21	whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. 
ACT.3.22	 For Moses truly said unto the fathers,
ACT.3.22	A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me;
ACT.3.22	him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.
ACT.3.23	shall be destroyed from among the people.
ACT.3.24	Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. 
ACT.3.25	 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. 
ACT.3.26	Unto you first God, having raised up his Son
ACT.4.1	And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, 
ACT.4.2	being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
ACT.4.3	And they laid hands on them, and put 
ACT.4.4	Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
ACT.4.5	And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, 
ACT.4.6	and Annas the high priest, and Cai´aphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. 
ACT.4.7	And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this? 
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, 
ACT.4.9	if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; 
ACT.4.10	be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, 
ACT.4.11	 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. 
ACT.4.12	Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
ACT.4.13	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. 
ACT.4.14	And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. 
ACT.4.15	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 
ACT.4.16	saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them 
ACT.4.17	But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. 
ACT.4.18	And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. 
ACT.4.20	For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. 
ACT.4.21	So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all 
ACT.4.22	For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was showed.
ACT.4.23	And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. 
ACT.4.24	 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou 
ACT.4.25	 who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said,
ACT.4.25	Why did the heathen rage,
ACT.4.25	and the people imagine vain things?
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth stood up,
ACT.4.26	and the rulers were gathered together
ACT.4.26	against the Lord, and against his Christ.
ACT.4.28	for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. 
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, 
ACT.4.30	by stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child
ACT.4.31	And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
ACT.4.33	And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. 
ACT.4.34	 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, 
ACT.4.35	and laid 
ACT.4.36	And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, 
ACT.4.37	having land, sold 
ACT.5.1	But a certain man named Anani´as, with Sapphi´ra his wife, sold a possession, 
ACT.5.2	and kept back 
ACT.5.3	But Peter said, Anani´as, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back 
ACT.5.4	While it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. 
ACT.5.5	And Anani´as hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things. 
ACT.5.6	And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried 
ACT.5.7	And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. 
ACT.5.8	And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. 
ACT.5.9	Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband 
ACT.5.10	Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying 
ACT.5.11	And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.
ACT.5.12	And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. 
ACT.5.13	And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them. 
ACT.5.14	And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;) 
ACT.5.15	insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid 
ACT.5.16	There came also a multitude 
ACT.5.17	Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation, 
ACT.5.18	and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. 
ACT.5.19	But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, 
ACT.5.20	Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. 
ACT.5.21	And when they heard 
ACT.5.21	But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. 
ACT.5.22	But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told, 
ACT.5.23	saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. 
ACT.5.24	Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow. 
ACT.5.25	Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. 
ACT.5.26	Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.
ACT.5.27	And when they had brought them, they set 
ACT.5.28	 saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. 
ACT.5.29	Then Peter and the 
ACT.5.30	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. 
ACT.5.31	Him hath God exalted with his right hand 
ACT.5.32	And we are his
ACT.5.33	When they heard 
ACT.5.34	Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gama´li-el, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; 
ACT.5.35	and said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. 
ACT.5.36	For before these days rose up Theu´das, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. 
ACT.5.37	After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, 
ACT.5.38	And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: 
ACT.5.39	but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.
ACT.5.40	And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten 
ACT.5.41	And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. 
ACT.5.42	And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
ACT.6.1	And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. 
ACT.6.2	Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples 
ACT.6.3	Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. 
ACT.6.4	But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. 
ACT.6.5	And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Proch´orus, and Nica´nor, and Timon, and Par´menas, and Nicolas a proselyte of An´ti-och; 
ACT.6.6	whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid 
ACT.6.7	And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
ACT.6.8	And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. 
ACT.6.9	Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called 
ACT.6.10	And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. 
ACT.6.11	Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and 
ACT.6.12	And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon 
ACT.6.13	and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: 
ACT.6.14	for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. 
ACT.6.15	And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	Then said the high priest, Are these things so? 
ACT.7.2	 And he said,
ACT.7.2	Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopota´mi-a, before he dwelt in Haran, 
ACT.7.3	and said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee. 
ACT.7.4	 Then came he out of the land of the Chalde´ans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. 
ACT.7.5	 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not 
ACT.7.6	 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat 
ACT.7.7	And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. 
ACT.7.8	 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so 
ACT.7.10	 and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. 
ACT.7.11	 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. 
ACT.7.12	 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. 
ACT.7.13	 And at the second 
ACT.7.14	 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to 
ACT.7.15	 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, 
ACT.7.16	 and were carried over into Shechem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hamor, 
ACT.7.18	till another king arose, which knew not Joseph. 
ACT.7.19	 The same dealt subtilely with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. 
ACT.7.20	 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months: 
ACT.7.21	 and when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. 
ACT.7.22	And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
ACT.7.24	And seeing one 
ACT.7.25	for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them; but they understood not. 
ACT.7.26	And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? 
ACT.7.27	But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? 
ACT.7.28	Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday? 
ACT.7.29	 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Mid´i-an, where he begat two sons.
ACT.7.31	When Moses saw 
ACT.7.32	, I 
ACT.7.33	Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. 
ACT.7.34	I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
ACT.7.35	This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send 
ACT.7.36	 He brought them out, after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. 
ACT.7.37	 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. 
ACT.7.38	 This is he, that was in the church
ACT.7.39	to whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust 
ACT.7.40	 saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for 
ACT.7.41	 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. 
ACT.7.42	 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets,
ACT.7.42	O ye house of Israel,
ACT.7.42	have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices
ACT.7.43	Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch,
ACT.7.43	and the star of your god Remphan,
ACT.7.43	figures which ye made to worship them:
ACT.7.43	and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
ACT.7.45	 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; 
ACT.7.46	 who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. 
ACT.7.47	 But Solomon built him a house. 
ACT.7.48	Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
ACT.7.49	and earth 
ACT.7.49	what house will ye build me? saith the Lord:
ACT.7.49	or what 
ACT.7.50	Hath not my hand made all these things?
ACT.7.52	Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: 
ACT.7.53	who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept 
ACT.7.54	When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with 
ACT.7.55	But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, 
ACT.7.56	and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. 
ACT.7.57	Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, 
ACT.7.58	and cast 
ACT.7.59	And they stoned Stephen, calling upon 
ACT.7.60	And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
ACT.8.1	And Saul was consenting unto his death.
ACT.8.1	And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. 
ACT.8.2	And devout men carried Stephen 
ACT.8.3	 As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed 
ACT.8.4	Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. 
ACT.8.5	Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. 
ACT.8.6	And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. 
ACT.8.7	For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed 
ACT.8.8	And there was great joy in that city.
ACT.8.9	But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: 
ACT.8.10	to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. 
ACT.8.11	And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. 
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
ACT.8.13	Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
ACT.8.14	Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: 
ACT.8.15	who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: 
ACT.8.16	(for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 
ACT.8.17	Then laid they 
ACT.8.18	And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 
ACT.8.19	saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. 
ACT.8.20	But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. 
ACT.8.21	 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. 
ACT.8.22	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. 
ACT.8.23	For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and 
ACT.8.24	Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
ACT.8.25	And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
ACT.8.26	And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south, unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. 
ACT.8.27	And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, 
ACT.8.28	was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the prophet. 
ACT.8.29	Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 
ACT.8.30	And Philip ran thither to 
ACT.8.31	And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. 
ACT.8.32	 The place of the Scripture which he read was this,
ACT.8.32	He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
ACT.8.32	and like a lamb dumb before his shearer,
ACT.8.32	so opened he not his mouth:
ACT.8.33	in his humiliation his judgment was taken away:
ACT.8.33	and who shall declare his generation?
ACT.8.33	for his life is taken from the earth.
ACT.8.34	And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? 
ACT.8.35	Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. 
ACT.8.36	And as they went on 
ACT.8.37	And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
ACT.8.38	And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. 
ACT.8.40	But Philip was found at Azo´tus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesare´a.
ACT.9.1	And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 
ACT.9.2	and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.3	And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 
ACT.9.4	and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
ACT.9.5	And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: 
ACT.9.6	And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord 
ACT.9.7	And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. 
ACT.9.8	And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought 
ACT.9.9	And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
ACT.9.10	And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Anani´as; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Anani´as. And he said, Behold, I 
ACT.9.11	And the Lord 
ACT.9.12	and hath seen in a vision a man named Anani´as coming in, and putting 
ACT.9.13	Then Anani´as answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: 
ACT.9.14	and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. 
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: 
ACT.9.16	for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake. 
ACT.9.17	And Anani´as went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, 
ACT.9.18	And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. 
ACT.9.19	And when he had received meat, he was strengthened.
ACT.9.19	Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus. 
ACT.9.20	And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. 
ACT.9.21	But all that heard 
ACT.9.22	But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.
ACT.9.24	but their laying wait was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him. 
ACT.9.25	Then the disciples took him by night, and let 
ACT.9.26	And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple. 
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas took him, and brought 
ACT.9.28	And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.29	And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. 
ACT.9.30	 when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesare´a, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
ACT.9.31	Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
ACT.9.32	And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all 
ACT.9.33	And there he found a certain man named Aene´as, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. 
ACT.9.34	And Peter said unto him, Aene´as, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. 
ACT.9.35	And all that dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord.
ACT.9.36	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tab´itha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas:
ACT.9.37	And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid 
ACT.9.38	And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring 
ACT.9.39	Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. 
ACT.9.40	But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning 
ACT.9.41	And he gave her 
ACT.9.42	And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
ACT.10.1	There was a certain man in Caesare´a called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian 
ACT.10.2	 devout 
ACT.10.3	He saw in a vision evidently, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. 
ACT.10.4	And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. 
ACT.10.5	And now send men to Joppa, and call for 
ACT.10.6	he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. 
ACT.10.7	And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; 
ACT.10.8	and when he had declared all 
ACT.10.9	On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: 
ACT.10.10	and he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, 
ACT.10.11	and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: 
ACT.10.12	wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. 
ACT.10.13	And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. 
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. 
ACT.10.15	And the voice 
ACT.10.16	This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
ACT.10.17	Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, 
ACT.10.18	and called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. 
ACT.10.19	While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. 
ACT.10.20	Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. 
ACT.10.21	Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what 
ACT.10.22	And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. 
ACT.10.23	Then called he them in, and lodged 
ACT.10.23	And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him. 
ACT.10.24	And the morrow after they entered into Caesare´a. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. 
ACT.10.25	And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped 
ACT.10.26	But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. 
ACT.10.27	And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. 
ACT.10.28	And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. 
ACT.10.29	Therefore came I 
ACT.10.30	And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, 
ACT.10.31	and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. 
ACT.10.32	Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of 
ACT.10.33	Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
ACT.10.35	but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. 
ACT.10.36	The word which 
ACT.10.37	that word, 
ACT.10.38	how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. 
ACT.10.39	And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: 
ACT.10.40	him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly; 
ACT.10.41	not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, 
ACT.10.42	And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God 
ACT.10.43	To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.
ACT.10.44	While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. 
ACT.10.45	And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
ACT.10.46	For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, 
ACT.10.47	Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? 
ACT.10.48	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
ACT.11.1	And the apostles and brethren that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 
ACT.11.2	And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, 
ACT.11.3	saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. 
ACT.11.4	But Peter rehearsed 
ACT.11.5	I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me: 
ACT.11.6	upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. 
ACT.11.7	And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat. 
ACT.11.8	But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth. 
ACT.11.9	But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, 
ACT.11.10	And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven. 
ACT.11.11	And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesare´a unto me. 
ACT.11.12	And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house: 
ACT.11.13	and he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter; 
ACT.11.14	who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved. 
ACT.11.15	And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. 
ACT.11.16	 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. 
ACT.11.17	Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as 
ACT.11.18	When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.
ACT.11.20	And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyre´ne, which, when they were come to An´ti-och, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.11.21	And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord. 
ACT.11.22	Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as An´ti-och. 
ACT.11.23	Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord. 
ACT.11.24	For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. 
ACT.11.25	Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 
ACT.11.26	and when he had found him, he brought him unto An´ti-och. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in An´ti-och.
ACT.11.27	And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto An´ti-och. 
ACT.11.28	 And there stood up one of them named Ag´abus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. 
ACT.11.29	Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea: 
ACT.11.30	which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
ACT.12.1	Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth 
ACT.12.2	And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. 
ACT.12.3	And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) 
ACT.12.4	 And when he had apprehended him, he put 
ACT.12.5	Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
ACT.12.6	And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. 
ACT.12.7	And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon 
ACT.12.8	And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. 
ACT.12.9	And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. 
ACT.12.10	When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. 
ACT.12.11	And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and 
ACT.12.12	And when he had considered 
ACT.12.13	And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. 
ACT.12.14	And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. 
ACT.12.15	And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. 
ACT.12.16	But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened 
ACT.12.17	But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.
ACT.12.18	Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. 
ACT.12.19	And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that 
ACT.12.20	And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's 
ACT.12.21	And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. 
ACT.12.22	And the people gave a shout, 
ACT.12.23	And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
ACT.12.24	But the word of God grew and multiplied.
ACT.12.25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled 
ACT.13.1	Now there were in the church that was at An´ti-och certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyre´ne, and Man´a-en, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. 
ACT.13.2	As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. 
ACT.13.3	And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid 
ACT.13.4	So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleu´cia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	And when they were at Sal´amis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to 
ACT.13.6	And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name 
ACT.13.7	which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.8	But El´ymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. 
ACT.13.9	Then Saul, (who also 
ACT.13.10	and said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, 
ACT.13.11	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord 
ACT.13.12	Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphyl´i-a: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem. 
ACT.13.14	But when they departed from Perga, they came to An´ti-och in Pisid´i-a, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down. 
ACT.13.15	And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, 
ACT.13.16	Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with 
ACT.13.16	Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience. 
ACT.13.17	 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm brought he them out of it. 
ACT.13.18	 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners
ACT.13.19	 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot. 
ACT.13.20	 And after that he gave 
ACT.13.21	 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. 
ACT.13.22	 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the 
ACT.13.23	Of this man's seed hath God, according to 
ACT.13.24	 when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
ACT.13.25	 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not 
ACT.13.26	Men 
ACT.13.27	For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled 
ACT.13.28	 And though they found no cause of death 
ACT.13.29	 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took 
ACT.13.30	But God raised him from the dead: 
ACT.13.31	 and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. 
ACT.13.32	And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, 
ACT.13.33	 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm,
ACT.13.33	Thou art my Son,
ACT.13.33	this day have I begotten thee.
ACT.13.34	I will give you the sure mercies of David.
ACT.13.35	Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
ACT.13.36	For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: 
ACT.13.37	but he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption. 
ACT.13.38	Be it known unto you therefore, men 
ACT.13.39	and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. 
ACT.13.40	Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
ACT.13.41	for I work a work in your days,
ACT.13.41	a work which ye shall in no wise believe,
ACT.13.41	though a man declare it unto you.
ACT.13.42	And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. 
ACT.13.43	Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
ACT.13.44	And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.45	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming. 
ACT.13.46	Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. 
ACT.13.47	 For so hath the Lord commanded us, 
ACT.13.47	I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles,
ACT.13.47	that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
ACT.13.48	And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. 
ACT.13.49	And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. 
ACT.13.51	 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Ico´ni-um. 
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
ACT.14.1	And it came to pass in Ico´ni-um, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. 
ACT.14.2	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren. 
ACT.14.3	Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. 
ACT.14.4	But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. 
ACT.14.5	And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use 
ACT.14.6	they were ware of 
ACT.14.7	and there they preached the gospel.
ACT.14.8	And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: 
ACT.14.9	the same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
ACT.14.10	said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. 
ACT.14.11	And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lyca-o´nia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. 
ACT.14.12	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercu´ri-us, because he was the chief speaker. 
ACT.14.13	Then the priest of Jupiter, which was
ACT.14.14	 when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard 
ACT.14.15	and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: 
ACT.14.16	who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. 
ACT.14.17	Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. 
ACT.14.18	And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.
ACT.14.19	And there came thither 
ACT.14.20	Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. 
ACT.14.21	And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and 
ACT.14.22	confirming the souls of the disciples, 
ACT.14.23	And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
ACT.14.24	And after they had passed throughout Pisid´i-a, they came to Pamphyl´i-a. 
ACT.14.25	And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attali´a: 
ACT.14.26	and thence sailed to An´ti-och, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. 
ACT.14.27	And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. 
ACT.14.28	And there they abode long time with the disciples.
ACT.15.2	When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. 
ACT.15.3	And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phoeni´cia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. 
ACT.15.4	And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and 
ACT.15.5	But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command 
ACT.15.6	And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. 
ACT.15.7	 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men 
ACT.15.8	 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as 
ACT.15.9	and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 
ACT.15.10	Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 
ACT.15.11	But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.
ACT.15.12	Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. 
ACT.15.13	And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men 
ACT.15.14	Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 
ACT.15.15	And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
ACT.15.16	and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down;
ACT.15.16	and I will build again the ruins thereof,
ACT.15.16	and I will set it up:
ACT.15.17	that the residue of men might seek after the Lord,
ACT.15.17	and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,
ACT.15.17	saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.
ACT.15.18	Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
ACT.15.19	Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: 
ACT.15.20	 but that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and 
ACT.15.21	For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
ACT.15.22	Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to An´ti-och with Paul and Barnabas; 
ACT.15.23	and they wrote 
ACT.15.24	Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, 
ACT.15.25	it seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
ACT.15.26	men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.15.27	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell 
ACT.15.28	For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; 
ACT.15.29	that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
ACT.15.30	So when they were dismissed, they came to An´ti-och: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: 
ACT.15.31	 when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. 
ACT.15.32	And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed 
ACT.15.33	And after they had tarried 
ACT.15.34	Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
ACT.15.35	Paul also and Barnabas continued in An´ti-och, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
ACT.15.36	And some days after, Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, 
ACT.15.37	And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. 
ACT.15.38	 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphyl´i-a, and went not with them to the work. 
ACT.15.39	And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; 
ACT.15.40	and Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. 
ACT.15.41	And he went through Syria and Cili´cia, confirming the churches.
ACT.16.1	Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father 
ACT.16.2	which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Ico´ni-um. 
ACT.16.3	Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.4	And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. 
ACT.16.5	And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
ACT.16.6	Now when they had gone throughout Phryg´i-a and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, 
ACT.16.7	after they were come to My´si-a, they assayed to go into Bithyn´i-a: but the Spirit suffered them not. 
ACT.16.8	And they passing by My´si-a came down to Tro´as. 
ACT.16.9	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedo´nia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedo´nia, and help us. 
ACT.16.10	And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedo´nia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.
ACT.16.11	Therefore loosing from Tro´as, we came with a straight course to Samothra´cia, and the next 
ACT.16.12	and from thence to Phil´ippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedo´nia, 
ACT.16.13	And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted 
ACT.16.14	And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thy-ati´ra, which worshipped God, heard 
ACT.16.15	And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought 
ACT.16.16	And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: 
ACT.16.17	the same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation. 
ACT.16.18	And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
ACT.16.19	And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew 
ACT.16.20	and brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, 
ACT.16.21	and teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans. 
ACT.16.22	And the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat 
ACT.16.23	And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast 
ACT.16.24	who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. 
ACT.16.26	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. 
ACT.16.27	And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. 
ACT.16.28	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. 
ACT.16.29	Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, 
ACT.16.30	and brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? 
ACT.16.31	And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. 
ACT.16.32	And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. 
ACT.16.33	And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed 
ACT.16.34	And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
ACT.16.35	And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go. 
ACT.16.36	And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace. 
ACT.16.37	But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast 
ACT.16.38	And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. 
ACT.16.39	And they came and besought them, and brought 
ACT.16.40	And they went out of the prison, and entered into 
ACT.17.1	Now when they had passed through Amphip´olis and Apollo´ni-a, they came to Thessaloni´ca, where was a synagogue of the Jews: 
ACT.17.2	and Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, 
ACT.17.3	opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. 
ACT.17.4	And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. 
ACT.17.5	But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. 
ACT.17.6	And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; 
ACT.17.7	whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, 
ACT.17.8	And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. 
ACT.17.9	And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the others, they let them go.
ACT.17.10	And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroe´a: who coming 
ACT.17.11	These were more noble than those in Thessaloni´ca, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so. 
ACT.17.12	Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. 
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews of Thessaloni´ca had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Beroe´a, they came thither also, and stirred up the people. 
ACT.17.14	And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timothy abode there still. 
ACT.17.15	And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy for to come to him with all speed, they departed.
ACT.17.16	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. 
ACT.17.17	Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. 
ACT.17.18	Then certain philosophers of the Epicure´ans, and of the Sto´ics, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. 
ACT.17.19	And they took him, and brought him unto Areop´agus,
ACT.17.20	For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. 
ACT.17.21	(For all the Athenians, and strangers which were there, spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)
ACT.17.22	Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill,
ACT.17.23	For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions,
ACT.17.24	 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; 
ACT.17.25	neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; 
ACT.17.26	and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; 
ACT.17.27	that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: 
ACT.17.28	for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said,
ACT.17.28	For we are also his offspring.
ACT.17.29	Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. 
ACT.17.30	And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: 
ACT.17.31	because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by 
ACT.17.32	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this 
ACT.17.33	So Paul departed from among them. 
ACT.17.34	Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which 
ACT.18.1	After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; 
ACT.18.2	and found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome,) and came unto them. 
ACT.18.3	And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: (for by their occupation they were tentmakers.) 
ACT.18.4	And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
ACT.18.5	And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedo´nia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews 
ACT.18.6	And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook 
ACT.18.7	And he departed thence, and entered into a certain 
ACT.18.8	And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. 
ACT.18.9	Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: 
ACT.18.10	for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. 
ACT.18.11	And he continued 
ACT.18.12	And when Gal´li-o was the deputy of Achai´a, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, 
ACT.18.13	saying, This 
ACT.18.14	And when Paul was now about to open 
ACT.18.15	but if it be a question of words and names, and 
ACT.18.16	And he drave them from the judgment seat. 
ACT.18.17	Then all the Greeks took Sos´thenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat 
ACT.18.19	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 
ACT.18.20	When they desired 
ACT.18.21	but bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
ACT.18.22	And when he had landed at Caesare´a, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to An´ti-och. 
ACT.18.23	And after he had spent some time 
ACT.18.24	And a certain Jew named Apol´los, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, 
ACT.18.25	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. 
ACT.18.26	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto 
ACT.18.27	And when he was disposed to pass into Achai´a, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: 
ACT.18.28	for he mightily convinced the Jews, 
ACT.19.1	And it came to pass, that, while Apol´los was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples, 
ACT.19.2	he said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. 
ACT.19.3	And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. 
ACT.19.4	 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. 
ACT.19.5	When they heard 
ACT.19.6	And when Paul had laid 
ACT.19.7	And all the men were about twelve.
ACT.19.8	And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. 
ACT.19.9	But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyran´nus. 
ACT.19.10	And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
ACT.19.11	And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 
ACT.19.12	so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. 
ACT.19.13	Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. 
ACT.19.14	And there were seven sons of 
ACT.19.15	And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? 
ACT.19.16	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 
ACT.19.17	And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. 
ACT.19.18	And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds. 
ACT.19.19	Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all 
ACT.19.20	So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
ACT.19.21	After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedo´nia and Achai´a, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. 
ACT.19.22	So he sent into Macedo´nia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Eras´tus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
ACT.19.23	And the same time there arose no small stir about that way. 
ACT.19.24	For a certain 
ACT.19.25	whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. 
ACT.19.26	Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: 
ACT.19.27	so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
ACT.19.28	And when they heard 
ACT.19.29	And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gai´us and Aristar´chus, men of Macedo´nia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theater. 
ACT.19.30	And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. 
ACT.19.31	And certain of the chief of Asia,
ACT.19.32	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together. 
ACT.19.33	And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense unto the people. 
ACT.19.34	But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great 
ACT.19.35	And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, 
ACT.19.36	Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. 
ACT.19.37	For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. 
ACT.19.38	Wherefore if Deme´tri-us, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another. 
ACT.19.39	But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. 
ACT.19.40	For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse. 
ACT.19.41	And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto 
ACT.20.2	And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, 
ACT.20.3	and 
ACT.20.4	And there accompanied him into Asia So´pater of Beroe´a; and of the Thessalo´ni-ans, Aristar´chus and Secun´dus; and Gai´us of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tych´icus and Troph´imus. 
ACT.20.5	These going before tarried for us at Tro´as. 
ACT.20.6	And we sailed away from Phil´ippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Tro´as in five days; where we abode seven days.
ACT.20.7	And upon the first 
ACT.20.8	And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. 
ACT.20.9	And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eu´tychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. 
ACT.20.10	And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing 
ACT.20.11	When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. 
ACT.20.12	And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
ACT.20.13	And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot. 
ACT.20.14	And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mityle´ne. 
ACT.20.15	And we sailed thence, and came the next 
ACT.20.16	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
ACT.20.17	And from Mile´tus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. 
ACT.20.18	And when they were come to him, he said unto them,
ACT.20.18	Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, 
ACT.20.19	serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: 
ACT.20.20	 how I kept back nothing that was profitable 
ACT.20.21	testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.20.22	And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: 
ACT.20.23	save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. 
ACT.20.24	 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. 
ACT.20.25	And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. 
ACT.20.26	Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I 
ACT.20.27	For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. 
ACT.20.28	Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. 
ACT.20.29	For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 
ACT.20.30	Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. 
ACT.20.31	Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. 
ACT.20.32	And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. 
ACT.20.33	I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. 
ACT.20.34	Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. 
ACT.20.35	I have showed you all things, how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
ACT.20.36	And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. 
ACT.20.37	And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, 
ACT.20.38	sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.
ACT.21.1	And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Co´os, and the 
ACT.21.2	and finding a ship sailing over unto Phoeni´cia, we went aboard, and set forth. 
ACT.21.3	Now when we had discovered
ACT.21.4	And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.5	And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till 
ACT.21.6	And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
ACT.21.7	And when we had finished 
ACT.21.8	 And the next 
ACT.21.9	And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy. 
ACT.21.10	 And as we tarried 
ACT.21.11	And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver 
ACT.21.12	And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.13	Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.21.14	And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
ACT.21.15	And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	There went with us also 
ACT.21.17	And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. 
ACT.21.18	And the 
ACT.21.19	And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. 
ACT.21.20	And when they heard 
ACT.21.21	and they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise 
ACT.21.22	What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. 
ACT.21.23	 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; 
ACT.21.24	them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave 
ACT.21.25	 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written 
ACT.21.26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.
ACT.21.27	And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, 
ACT.21.28	crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all 
ACT.21.29	 (For they had seen before with him in the city Troph´imus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.) 
ACT.21.30	And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut. 
ACT.21.31	And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar: 
ACT.21.32	who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. 
ACT.21.33	Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded 
ACT.21.34	And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle. 
ACT.21.35	And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. 
ACT.21.36	For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
ACT.21.37	And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? 
ACT.21.38	Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers? 
ACT.21.39	But Paul said, I am a man 
ACT.21.40	And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto 
ACT.22.1	Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defense 
ACT.22.2	(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
ACT.22.4	 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. 
ACT.22.5	As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
ACT.22.6	And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. 
ACT.22.7	And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
ACT.22.8	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. 
ACT.22.9	And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;
ACT.22.10	And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. 
ACT.22.11	And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
ACT.22.12	And one Anani´as, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt 
ACT.22.13	came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. 
ACT.22.14	And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth. 
ACT.22.15	For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard. 
ACT.22.16	And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
ACT.22.17	And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance; 
ACT.22.18	and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. 
ACT.22.19	And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee: 
ACT.22.20	 and when the blood of thy martyr
ACT.22.21	And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
ACT.22.22	And they gave him audience unto this word, and 
ACT.22.23	And as they cried out, and cast off 
ACT.22.24	the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him. 
ACT.22.25	And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? 
ACT.22.26	When the centurion heard 
ACT.22.27	Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. 
ACT.22.28	And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was 
ACT.22.29	Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
ACT.22.30	On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from 
ACT.23.1	And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men 
ACT.23.2	And the high priest Anani´as commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. 
ACT.23.3	 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, 
ACT.23.4	And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest? 
ACT.23.5	 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
ACT.23.7	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided. 
ACT.23.8	 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both. 
ACT.23.9	And there arose a great cry: and the scribes 
ACT.23.10	And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring 
ACT.23.11	And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
ACT.23.12	And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. 
ACT.23.13	And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy. 
ACT.23.14	And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul. 
ACT.23.15	Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you tomorrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
ACT.23.16	And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul. 
ACT.23.17	Then Paul called one of the centurions unto 
ACT.23.18	So he took him, and brought 
ACT.23.19	Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went 
ACT.23.20	And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly. 
ACT.23.21	But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee. 
ACT.23.22	So the chief captain 
ACT.23.23	And he called unto 
ACT.23.24	and provide 
ACT.23.25	And he wrote a letter after this manner:
ACT.23.26	Claudius Lys´i-as unto the most excellent governor Felix 
ACT.23.27	This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman. 
ACT.23.28	And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council: 
ACT.23.29	whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. 
ACT.23.30	And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what 
ACT.23.31	Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought 
ACT.23.32	On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: 
ACT.23.33	who, when they came to Caesare´a, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him. 
ACT.23.34	And when the governor had read 
ACT.23.35	I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
ACT.24.1	And after five days Anani´as the high priest descended with the elders, and 
ACT.24.2	And when he was called forth, Tertul´lus began to accuse 
ACT.24.2	Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, 
ACT.24.3	we accept 
ACT.24.4	Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. 
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man 
ACT.24.6	who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. 
ACT.24.7	But the chief captain Lys´i-as came 
ACT.24.8	commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
ACT.24.9	And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
ACT.24.10	Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered,
ACT.24.10	Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: 
ACT.24.11	because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. 
ACT.24.12	And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: 
ACT.24.13	neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. 
ACT.24.14	But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: 
ACT.24.15	and have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. 
ACT.24.16	And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offense toward God, and 
ACT.24.17	 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. 
ACT.24.18	Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. 
ACT.24.19	Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had aught against me. 
ACT.24.20	Or else let these same 
ACT.24.21	 except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
ACT.24.22	And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of 
ACT.24.23	And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let 
ACT.24.24	And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusil´la, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 
ACT.24.25	And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. 
ACT.24.26	He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. 
ACT.24.27	But after two years Por´ci-us Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
ACT.25.1	Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesare´a to Jerusalem. 
ACT.25.2	Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him, 
ACT.25.3	and desired favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. 
ACT.25.4	But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesare´a, and that he himself would depart shortly 
ACT.25.5	Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with 
ACT.25.6	And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesare´a; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought. 
ACT.25.7	And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove. 
ACT.25.8	While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all. 
ACT.25.9	But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? 
ACT.25.10	Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest. 
ACT.25.11	For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar. 
ACT.25.12	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.
ACT.25.13	And after certain days king Agrip´pa and Bernice came unto Caesare´a to salute Festus. 
ACT.25.14	And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix: 
ACT.25.15	about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed 
ACT.25.16	To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him. 
ACT.25.17	Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth. 
ACT.25.18	Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed: 
ACT.25.19	but had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. 
ACT.25.20	And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked 
ACT.25.21	But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar. 
ACT.25.22	Then Agrip´pa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. Tomorrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
ACT.25.23	And on the morrow, when Agrip´pa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth. 
ACT.25.24	And Festus said, King Agrip´pa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and 
ACT.25.25	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him. 
ACT.25.26	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrip´pa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write. 
ACT.25.27	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes 
ACT.26.1	Then Agrip´pa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
ACT.26.2	I think myself happy, king Agrip´pa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: 
ACT.26.3	especially 
ACT.26.4	My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; 
ACT.26.5	 which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. 
ACT.26.6	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers: 
ACT.26.7	unto which 
ACT.26.8	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
ACT.26.10	Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against 
ACT.26.11	And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled 
ACT.26.12	Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, 
ACT.26.13	at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. 
ACT.26.14	And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
ACT.26.15	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 
ACT.26.16	But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; 
ACT.26.17	delivering thee from the people, and 
ACT.26.18	to open their eyes, 
ACT.26.19	Whereupon, O king Agrip´pa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: 
ACT.26.20	 but showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and 
ACT.26.21	For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill 
ACT.26.22	Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: 
ACT.26.23	 that Christ should suffer, 
ACT.26.24	And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. 
ACT.26.25	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. 
ACT.26.26	For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. 
ACT.26.27	King Agrip´pa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. 
ACT.26.28	Then Agrip´pa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. 
ACT.26.29	And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
ACT.26.30	And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 
ACT.26.31	and when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. 
ACT.26.32	Then said Agrip´pa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
ACT.27.1	And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto 
ACT.27.2	And entering into a ship of Adramyt´ti-um, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; 
ACT.27.3	And the next 
ACT.27.4	And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. 
ACT.27.5	And when we had sailed over the sea of Cili´cia and Pamphyl´i-a, we came to Myra, 
ACT.27.6	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein. 
ACT.27.7	And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmo´ne; 
ACT.27.8	and, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called the Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city 
ACT.27.9	Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished 
ACT.27.10	and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. 
ACT.27.11	Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. 
ACT.27.12	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phoenix, 
ACT.27.13	And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained 
ACT.27.14	But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroc´lydon. 
ACT.27.15	And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let 
ACT.27.16	And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat: 
ACT.27.17	which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands,
ACT.27.18	And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next 
ACT.27.19	and the third 
ACT.27.20	And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on 
ACT.27.21	But after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss. 
ACT.27.22	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of 
ACT.27.23	For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, 
ACT.27.24	saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. 
ACT.27.25	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. 
ACT.27.26	Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
ACT.27.27	But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in A´dria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country; 
ACT.27.28	and sounded, and found 
ACT.27.29	Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. 
ACT.27.30	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, 
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. 
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
ACT.27.33	And while the day was coming on, Paul besought 
ACT.27.34	Wherefore I pray you to take 
ACT.27.35	And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all; and when he had broken 
ACT.27.36	Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took 
ACT.27.37	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. 
ACT.27.38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
ACT.27.39	And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. 
ACT.27.40	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed 
ACT.27.41	And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. 
ACT.27.42	And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. 
ACT.27.43	But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from 
ACT.27.44	and the rest, some on boards, and some on 
ACT.28.1	And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Meli´ta. 
ACT.28.2	And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. 
ACT.28.3	And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid 
ACT.28.4	And when the barbarians saw the 
ACT.28.5	And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. 
ACT.28.6	Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
ACT.28.7	In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Pub´li-us; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. 
ACT.28.8	And it came to pass, that the father of Pub´li-us lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux:
ACT.28.9	So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: 
ACT.28.10	who also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they laded 
ACT.28.11	And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. 
ACT.28.12	And landing at Syracuse, we tarried 
ACT.28.13	And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhe´gi-um: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Pute´oli: 
ACT.28.14	where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. 
ACT.28.15	And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Ap´pi-i Forum, and the Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. 
ACT.28.16	And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
ACT.28.17	And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men 
ACT.28.18	who, when they had examined me, would have let 
ACT.28.19	 But when the Jews spake against 
ACT.28.20	For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see 
ACT.28.21	And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came showed or spake any harm of thee. 
ACT.28.22	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
ACT.28.23	And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into 
ACT.28.24	And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. 
ACT.28.25	And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers, 
ACT.28.26	 saying,
ACT.28.26	Go unto this people, and say,
ACT.28.26	Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand;
ACT.28.26	and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
ACT.28.27	for the heart of this people is waxed gross,
ACT.28.27	and their ears are dull of hearing,
ACT.28.27	and their eyes have they closed;
ACT.28.27	lest they should see with 
ACT.28.27	and hear with 
ACT.28.27	and understand with 
ACT.28.27	and should be converted, and I should heal them.
ACT.28.28	Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and 
ACT.28.29	And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
ACT.28.30	And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, 
ACT.28.31	preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
ROM.1.1	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called 
ROM.1.2	(which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy Scriptures,) 
ROM.1.3	concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; 
ROM.1.4	and declared 
ROM.1.5	by whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: 
ROM.1.6	among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
ROM.1.7	To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called 
ROM.1.7	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 
ROM.1.9	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; 
ROM.1.10	making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. 
ROM.1.11	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; 
ROM.1.12	that is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 
ROM.1.13	 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. 
ROM.1.14	I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. 
ROM.1.15	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 
ROM.1.17	 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
ROM.1.18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold
ROM.1.19	because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed 
ROM.1.20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, 
ROM.1.21	because that, when they knew God, they glorified 
ROM.1.22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 
ROM.1.23	and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.
ROM.1.24	Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves: 
ROM.1.25	who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
ROM.1.26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 
ROM.1.27	and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.
ROM.1.28	And even as they did not like to retain God in 
ROM.1.29	being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 
ROM.1.30	backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 
ROM.1.31	without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 
ROM.1.32	who, knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
ROM.2.2	But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. 
ROM.2.3	And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? 
ROM.2.4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? 
ROM.2.5	but, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 
ROM.2.6	 who will render to every man according to his deeds: 
ROM.2.7	to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life: 
ROM.2.8	but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 
ROM.2.9	tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil; of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; 
ROM.2.10	but glory, honor, and peace, to every man that worketh good; to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: 
ROM.2.11	 for there is no respect of persons with God.
ROM.2.12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; 
ROM.2.13	(for not the hearers of the law 
ROM.2.14	For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: 
ROM.2.15	which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and 
ROM.2.16	in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
ROM.2.17	Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, 
ROM.2.18	and knowest 
ROM.2.19	and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, 
ROM.2.20	an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. 
ROM.2.21	Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 
ROM.2.22	thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? 
ROM.2.23	thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonorest thou God? 
ROM.2.24	 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
ROM.2.25	For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. 
ROM.2.26	Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? 
ROM.2.27	And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? 
ROM.2.28	For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither 
ROM.2.29	but he 
ROM.3.1	What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit 
ROM.3.2	Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. 
ROM.3.3	For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? 
ROM.3.4	 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written,
ROM.3.4	That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings,
ROM.3.4	and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? 
ROM.3.6	God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? 
ROM.3.7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? 
ROM.3.8	and not 
ROM.3.9	What then? are we better 
ROM.3.10	 as it is written,
ROM.3.10	There is none righteous, no, not one:
ROM.3.11	there is none that understandeth,
ROM.3.11	there is none that seeketh after God.
ROM.3.12	They are all gone out of the way,
ROM.3.12	they are together become unprofitable;
ROM.3.12	there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
ROM.3.13	with their tongues they have used deceit;
ROM.3.13	the poison of asps 
ROM.3.16	destruction and misery 
ROM.3.17	and the way of peace have they not known:
ROM.3.19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. 
ROM.3.20	 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law 
ROM.3.21	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 
ROM.3.22	 even the righteousness of God 
ROM.3.23	for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 
ROM.3.24	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 
ROM.3.25	whom God hath set forth 
ROM.3.26	to declare, 
ROM.3.27	Where 
ROM.3.28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 
ROM.3.29	 the God of the Jews only? 
ROM.3.30	seeing 
ROM.3.31	Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
ROM.4.1	What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? 
ROM.4.2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath 
ROM.4.3	 For what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. 
ROM.4.4	Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 
ROM.4.5	But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
ROM.4.6	Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, 
ROM.4.7	Blessed 
ROM.4.8	Blessed 
ROM.4.10	How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 
ROM.4.11	 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which 
ROM.4.12	and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which 
ROM.4.14	 For if they which are of the law 
ROM.4.15	because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, 
ROM.4.17	 (as it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, 
ROM.4.18	 who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. 
ROM.4.19	 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: 
ROM.4.20	he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
ROM.4.21	and being fully persuaded, that what he had promised, he was able also to perform. 
ROM.4.22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. 
ROM.4.23	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; 
ROM.4.24	but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; 
ROM.4.25	who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.
ROM.5.1	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 
ROM.5.2	by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
ROM.5.3	And not only 
ROM.5.4	and patience, experience; and experience, hope: 
ROM.5.5	and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
ROM.5.6	For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 
ROM.5.7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. 
ROM.5.8	But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 
ROM.5.9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 
ROM.5.10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. 
ROM.5.11	And not only 
ROM.5.13	for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 
ROM.5.14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
ROM.5.15	But not as the offense, so also 
ROM.5.16	And not as 
ROM.5.17	For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.
ROM.5.18	Therefore, as by the offense of one 
ROM.5.19	For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. 
ROM.5.20	Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 
ROM.5.21	that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 
ROM.6.2	God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? 
ROM.6.3	Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 
ROM.6.4	 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
ROM.6.5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also 
ROM.6.6	knowing this, that our old man is crucified with 
ROM.6.7	For he that is dead is freed from sin. 
ROM.6.8	Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: 
ROM.6.9	knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. 
ROM.6.10	For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 
ROM.6.11	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. 
ROM.6.13	Neither yield ye your members 
ROM.6.14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
ROM.6.15	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. 
ROM.6.16	Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 
ROM.6.17	But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. 
ROM.6.18	Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. 
ROM.6.19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
ROM.6.20	For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. 
ROM.6.21	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things 
ROM.6.22	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. 
ROM.6.23	For the wages of sin 
ROM.7.1	Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? 
ROM.7.2	For the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to 
ROM.7.3	So then if, while 
ROM.7.4	Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, 
ROM.7.5	For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. 
ROM.7.6	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead
ROM.7.8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin 
ROM.7.9	For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. 
ROM.7.10	And the commandment, which 
ROM.7.11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew 
ROM.7.12	Wherefore the law 
ROM.7.13	Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. 
ROM.7.14	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. 
ROM.7.15	 For that which I do, I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. 
ROM.7.16	If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that 
ROM.7.17	Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 
ROM.7.18	For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but 
ROM.7.19	For the good that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. 
ROM.7.20	Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
ROM.7.21	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. 
ROM.7.22	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 
ROM.7.23	but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 
ROM.7.24	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? 
ROM.7.25	I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
ROM.8.2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. 
ROM.8.3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: 
ROM.8.4	that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 
ROM.8.5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 
ROM.8.6	For to be carnally minded 
ROM.8.7	Because the carnal mind 
ROM.8.8	So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
ROM.8.9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. 
ROM.8.10	And if Christ 
ROM.8.11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
ROM.8.12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. 
ROM.8.13	For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. 
ROM.8.14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 
ROM.8.15	 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 
ROM.8.16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: 
ROM.8.17	and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with 
ROM.8.18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time 
ROM.8.19	For the earnest expectation of the creature
ROM.8.20	For the creature
ROM.8.21	because the creature
ROM.8.22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 
ROM.8.23	And not only 
ROM.8.24	For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? 
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for that we see not, 
ROM.8.26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 
ROM.8.27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what 
ROM.8.28	And we know that all things work together for good to them
ROM.8.29	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate 
ROM.8.30	Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
ROM.8.31	What shall we then say to these things? If God 
ROM.8.32	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? 
ROM.8.33	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? 
ROM.8.34	Who 
ROM.8.35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? 
ROM.8.36	 As it is written,
ROM.8.36	For thy sake we are killed all the day long;
ROM.8.36	we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
ROM.8.37	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 
ROM.8.38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 
ROM.8.39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, 
ROM.9.2	that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. 
ROM.9.3	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: 
ROM.9.4	who are Israelites; to whom 
ROM.9.5	whose 
ROM.9.6	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they 
ROM.9.7	 neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, 
ROM.9.8	That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these 
ROM.9.9	 For this 
ROM.9.10	And not only 
ROM.9.11	(for 
ROM.9.12	 it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. 
ROM.9.13	 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
ROM.9.14	What shall we say then? 
ROM.9.15	 For he saith to Moses,
ROM.9.15	I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
ROM.9.15	and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
ROM.9.16	So then 
ROM.9.17	 For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh,
ROM.9.17	Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up,
ROM.9.17	that I might show my power in thee,
ROM.9.17	and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
ROM.9.18	Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will 
ROM.9.19	Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? 
ROM.9.20	 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed 
ROM.9.21	Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor? 
ROM.9.22	 if God, willing to show 
ROM.9.23	and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, 
ROM.9.24	even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? 
ROM.9.25	 As he saith also in Hose´a,
ROM.9.25	I will call them my people,
ROM.9.25	which were not my people;
ROM.9.25	and her beloved,
ROM.9.25	which was not beloved.
ROM.9.26	there shall they be called the children of the living God.
ROM.9.27	Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea,
ROM.9.27	a remnant shall be saved:
ROM.9.28	for he will finish the work, and cut 
ROM.9.28	because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
ROM.9.29	Except the Lord of Sab´a-oth had left us a seed,
ROM.9.29	we had been as Sodom,
ROM.9.29	and been made like unto Gomor´rah.
ROM.9.30	What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. 
ROM.9.31	But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. 
ROM.9.32	Wherefore? Because 
ROM.9.33	 as it is written,
ROM.9.33	Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling-stone
ROM.9.33	and rock of offense:
ROM.9.33	and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
ROM.10.1	Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. 
ROM.10.2	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. 
ROM.10.3	For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. 
ROM.10.4	For Christ 
ROM.10.6	 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down 
ROM.10.7	or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) 
ROM.10.8	But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, 
ROM.10.9	that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 
ROM.10.10	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 
ROM.10.11	 For the Scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. 
ROM.10.12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 
ROM.10.13	 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
ROM.10.14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 
ROM.10.15	 and how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
ROM.10.15	How beautiful are the feet of them
ROM.10.15	that preach the gospel of peace,
ROM.10.15	and bring glad tidings of good things!
ROM.10.17	So then faith 
ROM.10.18	Their sound went into all the earth,
ROM.10.18	and their words unto the ends of the world.
ROM.10.19	I will provoke you to jealousy by 
ROM.10.20	I was found of them that sought me not;
ROM.10.20	I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.
ROM.10.21	All day long I have stretched forth my hands
ROM.10.21	unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
ROM.11.2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the Scripture saith of Eli´jah? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
ROM.11.3	and digged down thine altars;
ROM.11.3	and I am left alone,
ROM.11.3	and they seek my life.
ROM.11.4	I have reserved to myself seven thousand men,
ROM.11.4	who have not bowed the knee to 
ROM.11.5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 
ROM.11.6	And if by grace, then 
ROM.11.7	What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded 
ROM.11.8	 (according as it is written,
ROM.11.8	God hath given them the spirit of slumber,
ROM.11.8	eyes that they should not see,
ROM.11.8	and ears that they should not hear;)
ROM.11.8	unto this day.
ROM.11.9	Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
ROM.11.9	and a stumbling-block, and a recompense unto them:
ROM.11.10	let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see,
ROM.11.10	and bow down their back alway.
ROM.11.11	I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but 
ROM.11.12	Now if the fall of them 
ROM.11.13	For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: 
ROM.11.14	if by any means I may provoke to emulation 
ROM.11.15	For if the casting away of them 
ROM.11.16	For if the firstfruit 
ROM.11.17	And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; 
ROM.11.18	boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. 
ROM.11.19	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in. 
ROM.11.20	Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear: 
ROM.11.21	for if God spared not the natural branches, 
ROM.11.22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in 
ROM.11.23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again. 
ROM.11.24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which be the natural 
ROM.11.25	For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. 
ROM.11.26	 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written,
ROM.11.26	There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer,
ROM.11.26	and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
ROM.11.27	when I shall take away their sins.
ROM.11.28	As concerning the gospel, 
ROM.11.29	For the gifts and calling of God 
ROM.11.30	For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: 
ROM.11.31	even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. 
ROM.11.32	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
ROM.11.33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable 
ROM.11.34	 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counselor? 
ROM.11.35	 or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? 
ROM.11.36	For of him, and through him, and to him, 
ROM.12.1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, 
ROM.12.2	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what 
ROM.12.3	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think 
ROM.12.4	 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: 
ROM.12.5	so we, 
ROM.12.6	 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, 
ROM.12.7	or ministry, 
ROM.12.8	or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, 
ROM.12.10	 kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another; 
ROM.12.11	not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 
ROM.12.12	rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; 
ROM.12.13	distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. 
ROM.12.17	Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. 
ROM.12.18	If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. 
ROM.12.19	 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but 
ROM.12.20	 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. 
ROM.12.21	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
ROM.13.1	Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. 
ROM.13.2	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. 
ROM.13.3	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: 
ROM.13.4	for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to 
ROM.13.5	Wherefore 
ROM.13.6	 For, for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. 
ROM.13.7	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute 
ROM.13.8	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. 
ROM.13.9	 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if 
ROM.13.10	Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore love 
ROM.13.11	And that, knowing the time, that now 
ROM.13.12	The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. 
ROM.13.13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying: 
ROM.13.14	but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to 
ROM.14.2	For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. 
ROM.14.3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. 
ROM.14.4	Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
ROM.14.5	One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day 
ROM.14.6	He that regardeth the day, regardeth 
ROM.14.7	For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. 
ROM.14.8	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. 
ROM.14.9	For to this end Christ both died, and rose,
ROM.14.11	 For it is written,
ROM.14.11	every knee shall bow to me,
ROM.14.11	and every tongue shall confess to God.
ROM.14.12	So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
ROM.14.13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in 
ROM.14.14	I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that 
ROM.14.15	But if thy brother be grieved with 
ROM.14.16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 
ROM.14.17	for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. 
ROM.14.18	For he that in these things serveth Christ 
ROM.14.19	Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. 
ROM.14.20	For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed 
ROM.14.21	 good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor 
ROM.14.22	Hast thou faith? have 
ROM.14.23	And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because 
ROM.15.1	We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 
ROM.15.2	Let every one of us please 
ROM.15.3	 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me. 
ROM.15.4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. 
ROM.15.5	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: 
ROM.15.6	that ye may with one mind 
ROM.15.7	Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us, to the glory of God. 
ROM.15.8	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises 
ROM.15.9	 and that the Gentiles might glorify God for 
ROM.15.9	For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles,
ROM.15.9	and sing unto thy name.
ROM.15.10	Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
ROM.15.11	Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles;
ROM.15.11	and laud him, all ye people.
ROM.15.12	There shall be a root of Jesse,
ROM.15.12	and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles;
ROM.15.12	in him shall the Gentiles trust.
ROM.15.13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
ROM.15.14	And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. 
ROM.15.15	Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God, 
ROM.15.16	that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. 
ROM.15.17	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God. 
ROM.15.18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, 
ROM.15.19	through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyr´icum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 
ROM.15.20	Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation: 
ROM.15.21	 but as it is written,
ROM.15.21	To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see:
ROM.15.21	and they that have not heard shall understand.
ROM.15.23	But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; 
ROM.15.24	whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your 
ROM.15.25	 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. 
ROM.15.26	For it hath pleased them of Macedo´nia and Achai´a to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem. 
ROM.15.27	 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. 
ROM.15.28	When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. 
ROM.15.29	And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
ROM.15.30	Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in 
ROM.15.31	that I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judea; and that my service which 
ROM.15.32	that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed. 
ROM.15.33	Now the God of peace 
ROM.16.1	I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cen´chre-ae: 
ROM.16.2	that ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succorer of many, and of myself also.
ROM.16.4	who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. 
ROM.16.5	Likewise 
ROM.16.6	Greet Mary, who bestowed much labor on us. 
ROM.16.7	Salute Andron´icus and Ju´ni-a, my kinsmen, and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. 
ROM.16.8	Greet Am´pli-as, my beloved in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	Salute Ur´bane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 
ROM.16.10	Salute Apel´les approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristob´ulus' 
ROM.16.11	Salute Hero´di-on my kinsman. Greet them that be of the 
ROM.16.12	Salute Tryphae´na and Trypho´sa, who labor in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which labored much in the Lord. 
ROM.16.13	 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 
ROM.16.14	Salute Asyn´critus, Phlegon, Hermas, Pat´robas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them. 
ROM.16.15	Salute Philol´ogus, and Julia, Ne´reus, and his sister, and Olym´pas, and all the saints which are with them. 
ROM.16.16	Salute one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.
ROM.16.17	Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. 
ROM.16.18	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. 
ROM.16.19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all 
ROM.16.20	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
ROM.16.22	I Tertius, who wrote 
ROM.16.24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
ROM.16.25	Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, 
ROM.16.26	but now is made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: 
ROM.16.27	to God only wise, 
1CO.1.1	Paul, called 
1CO.1.3	Grace 
1CO.1.4	I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; 
1CO.1.5	that in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and 
1CO.1.6	even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 
1CO.1.7	so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming
1CO.1.8	who shall also confirm you unto the end, 
1CO.1.9	God 
1CO.1.10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and 
1CO.1.11	For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them 
1CO.1.12	 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apol´los; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. 
1CO.1.13	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? 
1CO.1.14	 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gai´us; 
1CO.1.15	lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. 
1CO.1.16	 And I baptized also the household of Steph´anas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. 
1CO.1.17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
1CO.1.18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness; but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God. 
1CO.1.19	 For it is written,
1CO.1.19	I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
1CO.1.19	and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
1CO.1.21	For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 
1CO.1.22	For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 
1CO.1.23	but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; 
1CO.1.24	but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 
1CO.1.25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1CO.1.26	For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, 
1CO.1.27	but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; 
1CO.1.28	and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, 
1CO.1.29	that no flesh should glory in his presence. 
1CO.1.30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 
1CO.1.31	 that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
1CO.2.1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. 
1CO.2.2	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. 
1CO.2.3	 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. 
1CO.2.4	And my speech and my preaching 
1CO.2.5	that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
1CO.2.6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: 
1CO.2.7	but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, 
1CO.2.8	which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known 
1CO.2.9	 But as it is written,
1CO.2.9	Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
1CO.2.9	neither have entered into the heart of man,
1CO.2.9	the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
1CO.2.10	But God hath revealed 
1CO.2.11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 
1CO.2.12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. 
1CO.2.13	Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
1CO.2.14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know 
1CO.2.15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. 
1CO.2.16	 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
1CO.3.1	And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, 
1CO.3.2	 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able 
1CO.3.3	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas 
1CO.3.4	 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I 
1CO.3.5	Who then is Paul, and who 
1CO.3.6	 I have planted, Apol´los watered; but God gave the increase. 
1CO.3.7	So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 
1CO.3.8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. 
1CO.3.9	For we are laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, 
1CO.3.10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. 
1CO.3.11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
1CO.3.12	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; 
1CO.3.13	every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. 
1CO.3.14	If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
1CO.3.17	If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which 
1CO.3.18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. 
1CO.3.19	 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God: for it is written,
1CO.3.19	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
1CO.3.20	The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise,
1CO.3.20	that they are vain.
1CO.3.21	Therefore let no man glory in men: for all things are yours; 
1CO.3.22	whether Paul, or Apol´los, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 
1CO.3.23	and ye are Christ's; and Christ 
1CO.4.1	Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
1CO.4.2	Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
1CO.4.3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. 
1CO.4.4	For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. 
1CO.4.5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
1CO.4.6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and 
1CO.4.7	For who maketh thee to differ 
1CO.4.8	Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. 
1CO.4.9	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. 
1CO.4.10	We 
1CO.4.11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place; 
1CO.4.12	 and labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: 
1CO.4.13	being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, 
1CO.4.14	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn 
1CO.4.15	For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet 
1CO.4.16	 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. 
1CO.4.17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
1CO.4.18	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. 
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God 
1CO.4.21	What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and 
1CO.5.2	And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
1CO.5.3	For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, 
1CO.5.4	in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1CO.5.5	to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
1CO.5.7	 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: 
1CO.5.8	 therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened 
1CO.5.9	I wrote unto you in an
1CO.5.10	yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. 
1CO.5.11	But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one, no, not to eat. 
1CO.5.12	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? 
1CO.5.13	But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
1CO.6.1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? 
1CO.6.2	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 
1CO.6.3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? 
1CO.6.4	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. 
1CO.6.5	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? 
1CO.6.6	but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
1CO.6.7	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather 
1CO.6.8	Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that 
1CO.6.9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 
1CO.6.10	nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 
1CO.6.11	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body 
1CO.6.14	And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. 
1CO.6.15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make 
1CO.6.16	 What! know ye not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. 
1CO.6.17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. 
1CO.6.18	Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. 
1CO.6.19	 What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost 
1CO.6.20	For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
1CO.7.1	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: 
1CO.7.2	Nevertheless, 
1CO.7.3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence:
1CO.7.4	The wife hath not power of
1CO.7.5	Defraud ye not one the other, except 
1CO.7.6	But I speak this by permission, 
1CO.7.7	For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
1CO.7.8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. 
1CO.7.9	But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
1CO.7.11	but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to 
1CO.7.12	But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. 
1CO.7.13	And the woman which hath a husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. 
1CO.7.15	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such 
1CO.7.16	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save 
1CO.7.17	But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches. 
1CO.7.18	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. 
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. 
1CO.7.20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. 
1CO.7.21	Art thou called 
1CO.7.22	For he that is called in the Lord, 
1CO.7.23	Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. 
1CO.7.24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
1CO.7.25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
1CO.7.26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, 
1CO.7.27	Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. 
1CO.7.28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you. 
1CO.7.29	But this I say, brethren, the time 
1CO.7.30	and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; 
1CO.7.31	and they that use this world, as not abusing 
1CO.7.32	But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: 
1CO.7.33	but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please 
1CO.7.34	There is difference 
1CO.7.35	And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
1CO.7.36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of 
1CO.7.37	Nevertheless he that standeth steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. 
1CO.7.38	So then he that giveth 
1CO.7.39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. 
1CO.7.40	But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.
1CO.8.1	Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. 
1CO.8.2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. 
1CO.8.3	But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
1CO.8.4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol 
1CO.8.5	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) 
1CO.8.6	but to us 
1CO.8.7	Howbeit 
1CO.8.8	But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. 
1CO.8.9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling-block to them that are weak. 
1CO.8.10	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; 
1CO.8.11	and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? 
1CO.8.12	But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. 
1CO.8.13	Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
1CO.9.1	Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 
1CO.9.2	If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
1CO.9.3	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this: 
1CO.9.4	Have we not power
1CO.9.5	Have we not power
1CO.9.6	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power
1CO.9.7	Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
1CO.9.8	Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? 
1CO.9.9	 For it is written in the law of Moses,
1CO.9.9	Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox
1CO.9.9	that treadeth out the corn.
1CO.9.9	Doth God take care for oxen? 
1CO.9.10	or saith he 
1CO.9.11	 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, 
1CO.9.12	If others be partakers of 
1CO.9.12	Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 
1CO.9.13	 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live 
1CO.9.14	 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
1CO.9.15	But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for 
1CO.9.16	For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! 
1CO.9.17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation 
1CO.9.18	What is my reward then? 
1CO.9.19	For though I be free from all 
1CO.9.20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 
1CO.9.21	to them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. 
1CO.9.22	To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all 
1CO.9.23	And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with 
1CO.9.24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. 
1CO.9.25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they 
1CO.9.26	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: 
1CO.9.27	but I keep under my body, and bring 
1CO.10.2	and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 
1CO.10.3	 and did all eat the same spiritual meat; 
1CO.10.4	 and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. 
1CO.10.5	 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1CO.10.7	 Neither be ye idolaters, as 
1CO.10.8	 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. 
1CO.10.9	 Neither let us tempt Christ,
1CO.10.10	 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. 
1CO.10.11	Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 
1CO.10.12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. 
1CO.10.13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God 
1CO.10.14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. 
1CO.10.15	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. 
1CO.10.16	 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? 
1CO.10.17	For we 
1CO.10.18	 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? 
1CO.10.19	What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? 
1CO.10.20	 But 
1CO.10.21	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. 
1CO.10.22	 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1CO.10.24	Let no man seek his own, but every man another's 
1CO.10.25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, 
1CO.10.26	 for the earth 
1CO.10.27	If any of them that believe not bid you 
1CO.10.28	But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience' sake: for the earth 
1CO.10.29	conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another 
1CO.10.30	For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
1CO.10.31	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: 
1CO.10.33	even as I please all 
1CO.11.2	Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances,
1CO.11.3	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman 
1CO.11.4	Every man praying or prophesying, having 
1CO.11.5	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with 
1CO.11.6	For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. 
1CO.11.7	 For a man indeed ought not to cover 
1CO.11.8	 For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. 
1CO.11.9	Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. 
1CO.11.10	For this cause ought the woman to have power
1CO.11.11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. 
1CO.11.12	For as the woman 
1CO.11.13	Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? 
1CO.11.14	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? 
1CO.11.15	But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for 
1CO.11.16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
1CO.11.17	Now in this that I declare 
1CO.11.18	For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. 
1CO.11.19	For there must be also heresies
1CO.11.20	When ye come together therefore into one place, 
1CO.11.21	For in eating every one taketh before 
1CO.11.22	What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise 
1CO.11.23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus, the 
1CO.11.24	and when he had given thanks, he brake 
1CO.11.25	 After the same manner also 
1CO.11.26	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come.
1CO.11.27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink 
1CO.11.28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of 
1CO.11.29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 
1CO.11.30	For this cause many 
1CO.11.31	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. 
1CO.11.32	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
1CO.11.33	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. 
1CO.11.34	And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
1CO.12.1	Now concerning spiritual 
1CO.12.2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. 
1CO.12.3	Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and 
1CO.12.5	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. 
1CO.12.6	And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. 
1CO.12.7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. 
1CO.12.8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 
1CO.12.9	to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 
1CO.12.10	to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another 
1CO.12.11	but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
1CO.12.13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether 
1CO.12.14	For the body is not one member, but many. 
1CO.12.15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body 
1CO.12.18	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. 
1CO.12.19	And if they were all one member, where 
1CO.12.20	But now 
1CO.12.21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 
1CO.12.22	Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: 
1CO.12.23	and those 
1CO.12.24	For our comely 
1CO.12.25	that there should be no schism in the body; but 
1CO.12.26	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.
1CO.12.27	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. 
1CO.12.28	 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 
1CO.12.29	 all apostles? 
1CO.12.30	have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? 
1CO.12.31	But covet earnestly the best gifts.
1CO.12.31	And yet show I unto you a more excellent way.
1CO.13.1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become 
1CO.13.2	 And though I have 
1CO.13.3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed 
1CO.13.4	Charity suffereth long, 
1CO.13.5	doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; 
1CO.13.6	rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 
1CO.13.7	beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
1CO.13.8	Charity never faileth: but whether 
1CO.13.9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 
1CO.13.10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 
1CO.13.12	For now we see through a glass, darkly, but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. 
1CO.13.13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these 
1CO.14.1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual 
1CO.14.2	For he that speaketh in an 
1CO.14.3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men 
1CO.14.4	He that speaketh in an 
1CO.14.5	I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater 
1CO.14.6	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? 
1CO.14.7	And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? 
1CO.14.8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? 
1CO.14.9	So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. 
1CO.14.10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them 
1CO.14.11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh 
1CO.14.12	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual 
1CO.14.13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in an 
1CO.14.15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. 
1CO.14.16	Else, when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? 
1CO.14.17	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. 
1CO.14.18	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: 
1CO.14.19	yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that 
1CO.14.20	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men. 
1CO.14.21	 In the law it is written,
1CO.14.21	With 
1CO.14.21	will I speak unto this people;
1CO.14.21	and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.
1CO.14.22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying 
1CO.14.23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in 
1CO.14.24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or 
1CO.14.25	and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on 
1CO.14.26	How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. 
1CO.14.27	If any man speak in an 
1CO.14.28	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. 
1CO.14.29	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. 
1CO.14.30	If 
1CO.14.31	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. 
1CO.14.32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 
1CO.14.33	For God is not 
1CO.14.34	Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but 
1CO.14.35	And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. 
1CO.14.36	What! came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?
1CO.14.37	If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. 
1CO.14.38	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. 
1CO.14.39	Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. 
1CO.14.40	Let all things be done decently and in order.
1CO.15.1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1CO.15.2	by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
1CO.15.4	 and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures: 
1CO.15.5	 and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: 
1CO.15.6	after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. 
1CO.15.7	After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. 
1CO.15.8	 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. 
1CO.15.9	 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which 
1CO.15.11	Therefore whether 
1CO.15.12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
1CO.15.13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: 
1CO.15.14	and if Christ be not risen, then 
1CO.15.15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. 
1CO.15.16	For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 
1CO.15.17	and if Christ be not raised, your faith 
1CO.15.18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. 
1CO.15.19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
1CO.15.20	But now is Christ risen from the dead, 
1CO.15.21	For since by man 
1CO.15.22	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 
1CO.15.23	But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. 
1CO.15.24	Then 
1CO.15.25	 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. 
1CO.15.26	The last enemy 
1CO.15.27	 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put under 
1CO.15.28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
1CO.15.29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? 
1CO.15.30	and why stand we in jeopardy every hour? 
1CO.15.31	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. 
1CO.15.32	 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die. 
1CO.15.33	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. 
1CO.15.34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak 
1CO.15.35	But some 
1CO.15.36	 fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: 
1CO.15.37	and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other 
1CO.15.38	but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. 
1CO.15.39	All flesh 
1CO.15.40	 also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial 
1CO.15.41	 one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for 
1CO.15.42	So also 
1CO.15.43	it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power: 
1CO.15.44	it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. 
1CO.15.45	 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam 
1CO.15.46	Howbeit that 
1CO.15.47	The first man 
1CO.15.48	As 
1CO.15.49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. 
1CO.15.50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
1CO.15.52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 
1CO.15.53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal 
1CO.15.54	 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 
1CO.15.55	 O death, where 
1CO.15.56	The sting of death 
1CO.15.57	But thanks 
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
1CO.16.2	Upon the first 
1CO.16.3	And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by 
1CO.16.4	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
1CO.16.6	And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. 
1CO.16.7	For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. 
1CO.16.8	 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. 
1CO.16.9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and 
1CO.16.11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
1CO.16.12	As touching 
1CO.16.13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
1CO.16.14	Let all your things be done with charity.
1CO.16.16	that ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with 
1CO.16.17	I am glad of the coming of Steph´anas and Fortuna´tus and Acha´icus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. 
1CO.16.18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
1CO.16.20	All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with a holy kiss.
1CO.16.21	The salutation of 
1CO.16.22	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anath´ema, Maranath´a. 
1CO.16.23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
1CO.16.24	My love 
2CO.1.2	Grace 
2CO.1.3	Blessed 
2CO.1.4	who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. 
2CO.1.5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. 
2CO.1.6	And whether we be afflicted, 
2CO.1.7	And our hope of you 
2CO.1.9	but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 
2CO.1.10	who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver 
2CO.1.11	ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift 
2CO.1.12	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. 
2CO.1.13	For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; 
2CO.1.14	as also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also 
2CO.1.15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit; 
2CO.1.16	 and to pass by you into Macedo´nia, and to come again out of Macedo´nia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judea. 
2CO.1.17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea, yea, and nay, nay? 
2CO.1.18	But 
2CO.1.19	 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, 
2CO.1.20	For all the promises of God in him 
2CO.1.21	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, 
2CO.1.22	who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
2CO.1.23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. 
2CO.1.24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
2CO.2.1	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. 
2CO.2.2	For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? 
2CO.2.3	And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is 
2CO.2.4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
2CO.2.5	But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. 
2CO.2.6	Sufficient to such a man 
2CO.2.7	So that contrariwise ye 
2CO.2.8	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm 
2CO.2.9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. 
2CO.2.10	To whom ye forgive any thing, I 
2CO.2.11	lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2CO.2.13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedo´nia.
2CO.2.14	Now thanks 
2CO.2.15	For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: 
2CO.2.16	to the one 
2CO.2.17	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
2CO.3.1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some 
2CO.3.2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: 
2CO.3.4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 
2CO.3.5	not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency 
2CO.3.6	 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
2CO.3.8	how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 
2CO.3.9	For if the ministration of condemnation 
2CO.3.10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. 
2CO.3.11	For if that which is done away 
2CO.3.12	Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: 
2CO.3.13	 and not as Moses, 
2CO.3.14	but their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which 
2CO.3.15	But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. 
2CO.3.16	Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. 
2CO.3.17	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord 
2CO.3.18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, 
2CO.4.1	Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; 
2CO.4.2	but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but, by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. 
2CO.4.3	But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 
2CO.4.4	in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. 
2CO.4.5	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. 
2CO.4.6	 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to 
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. 
2CO.4.8	 troubled on every side, yet not distressed; 
2CO.4.9	persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; 
2CO.4.10	always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. 
2CO.4.11	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. 
2CO.4.12	So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
2CO.4.14	knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present 
2CO.4.15	For all things 
2CO.4.16	For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward 
2CO.4.17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding 
2CO.4.18	while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen 
2CO.5.1	For we know that, if our earthly house of 
2CO.5.2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: 
2CO.5.3	if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. 
2CO.5.4	For we that are in 
2CO.5.5	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing 
2CO.5.6	Therefore 
2CO.5.7	(for we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
2CO.5.8	we are confident, 
2CO.5.9	Wherefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. 
2CO.5.10	 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things 
2CO.5.11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. 
2CO.5.12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to 
2CO.5.13	For whether we be beside ourselves, 
2CO.5.14	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: 
2CO.5.15	and 
2CO.5.16	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we 
2CO.5.17	Therefore if any man 
2CO.5.18	And all things 
2CO.5.19	to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. 
2CO.5.20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech 
2CO.5.21	For he hath made him 
2CO.6.1	We then, 
2CO.6.2	 (For he saith,
2CO.6.2	I have heard thee in a time accepted,
2CO.6.2	and in the day of salvation have I succored thee:
2CO.6.2	Behold, now 
2CO.6.3	Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: 
2CO.6.4	but in all 
2CO.6.5	 in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; 
2CO.6.6	by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, 
2CO.6.7	by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
2CO.6.8	by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and 
2CO.6.9	as unknown, and 
2CO.6.10	as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and 
2CO.6.11	O 
2CO.6.12	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. 
2CO.6.13	Now for a recompense in the same, (I speak as unto 
2CO.6.14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	And what concord hath Christ with Be´li-al? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? 
2CO.6.16	 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said,
2CO.6.16	I will dwell in them, and walk in 
2CO.6.16	and I will be their God,
2CO.6.16	and they shall be my people.
2CO.6.17	and be ye separate,
2CO.6.17	saith the Lord,
2CO.6.17	and touch not the unclean 
2CO.6.17	and I will receive you,
2CO.6.18	and ye shall be my sons and daughters,
2CO.6.18	saith the Lord Almighty.
2CO.7.1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
2CO.7.2	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. 
2CO.7.3	I speak not 
2CO.7.4	Great 
2CO.7.6	Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; 
2CO.7.7	and not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. 
2CO.7.8	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though 
2CO.7.9	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. 
2CO.7.10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. 
2CO.7.11	For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, 
2CO.7.12	Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, 
2CO.7.13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. 
2CO.7.14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which 
2CO.7.15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. 
2CO.7.16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all 
2CO.8.2	how that in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. 
2CO.8.3	For to 
2CO.8.4	praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and 
2CO.8.5	And 
2CO.8.6	Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. 
2CO.8.7	Therefore, as ye abound in every 
2CO.8.8	I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. 
2CO.8.9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. 
2CO.8.10	And herein I give 
2CO.8.11	Now therefore perform the doing 
2CO.8.12	For if there be first a willing mind, 
2CO.8.13	For 
2CO.8.14	but by an equality, 
2CO.8.15	 as it is written,
2CO.8.15	He that 
2CO.8.15	and he that 
2CO.8.16	But thanks 
2CO.8.17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. 
2CO.8.18	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise 
2CO.8.19	and not 
2CO.8.20	avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: 
2CO.8.21	 providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
2CO.8.22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which 
2CO.8.23	Whether 
2CO.8.24	Wherefore show ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
2CO.9.1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: 
2CO.9.2	for I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedo´nia, that Achai´a was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many. 
2CO.9.3	Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: 
2CO.9.4	lest haply if they of Macedo´nia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. 
2CO.9.5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as 
2CO.9.6	But this 
2CO.9.7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, 
2CO.9.8	And God 
2CO.9.9	 (as it is written,
2CO.9.9	He hath dispersed abroad;
2CO.9.9	he hath given to the poor:
2CO.9.9	his righteousness remaineth for ever.
2CO.9.11	being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. 
2CO.9.12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; 
2CO.9.13	while by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for 
2CO.9.14	and by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you. 
2CO.9.15	Thanks 
2CO.10.1	Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence 
2CO.10.2	but I beseech 
2CO.10.3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 
2CO.10.4	(for the weapons of our warfare 
2CO.10.5	casting down imaginations,
2CO.10.6	and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
2CO.10.7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he 
2CO.10.8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: 
2CO.10.9	that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. 
2CO.10.10	For 
2CO.10.11	Let such a one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such 
2CO.10.12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
2CO.10.13	But we will not boast of things without 
2CO.10.14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond 
2CO.10.15	not boasting of things without 
2CO.10.16	to preach the gospel in the 
2CO.10.17	 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 
2CO.10.18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
2CO.11.1	Would to God ye could bear with me a little in 
2CO.11.2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present 
2CO.11.3	 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 
2CO.11.4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or 
2CO.11.5	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 
2CO.11.6	But though 
2CO.11.7	Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? 
2CO.11.8	I robbed other churches, taking wages 
2CO.11.9	 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedo´nia supplied: and in all 
2CO.11.10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achai´a. 
2CO.11.11	Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
2CO.11.12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 
2CO.11.13	For such 
2CO.11.14	And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	Therefore 
2CO.11.16	I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. 
2CO.11.17	That which I speak, I speak 
2CO.11.18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. 
2CO.11.19	For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye 
2CO.11.20	For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour 
2CO.11.21	I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
2CO.11.21	Howbeit, whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. 
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? so 
2CO.11.23	 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool,) I 
2CO.11.24	 Of the Jews five times received I forty 
2CO.11.25	 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 
2CO.11.27	in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 
2CO.11.28	Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. 
2CO.11.29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
2CO.11.30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. 
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
2CO.11.32	 In Damascus the governor under Ar´etas the king kept the city of the Dam´ascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 
2CO.11.33	and through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
2CO.12.1	It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such a one caught up to the third heaven. 
2CO.12.3	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) 
2CO.12.4	how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. 
2CO.12.5	Of such a one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities. 
2CO.12.6	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but 
2CO.12.7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. 
2CO.12.8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. 
2CO.12.9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
2CO.12.10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
2CO.12.11	I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing. 
2CO.12.12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. 
2CO.12.13	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except 
2CO.12.14	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
2CO.12.15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. 
2CO.12.16	But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile. 
2CO.12.17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? 
2CO.12.18	I desired Titus, and with 
2CO.12.19	Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but 
2CO.12.20	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and 
2CO.12.21	 lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and 
2CO.13.2	I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare: 
2CO.13.3	since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you. 
2CO.13.4	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
2CO.13.5	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 
2CO.13.6	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. 
2CO.13.7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. 
2CO.13.8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 
2CO.13.9	For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, 
2CO.13.10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
2CO.13.11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. 
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
2CO.13.13	All the saints salute you.
2CO.13.14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, 
GAL.1.1	Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 
GAL.1.2	and all the brethren which are with me.
GAL.1.2	Unto the churches of Galatia:
GAL.1.3	Grace 
GAL.1.4	who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: 
GAL.1.5	to whom 
GAL.1.6	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 
GAL.1.7	which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 
GAL.1.8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 
GAL.1.9	As we said before, so say I now again, If any 
GAL.1.10	For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
GAL.1.11	But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. 
GAL.1.12	For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught 
GAL.1.13	 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: 
GAL.1.14	 and profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. 
GAL.1.15	 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called 
GAL.1.16	to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 
GAL.1.17	neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
GAL.1.19	But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. 
GAL.1.20	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. 
GAL.1.21	Afterward I came into the regions of Syria and Cili´cia; 
GAL.1.22	and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ: 
GAL.1.23	but they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 
GAL.1.24	And they glorified God in me.
GAL.2.2	And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. 
GAL.2.3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: 
GAL.2.4	and that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: 
GAL.2.5	to whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. 
GAL.2.6	 But of those who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed 
GAL.2.7	but contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as 
GAL.2.8	(for he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles;) 
GAL.2.9	and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we 
GAL.2.10	Only 
GAL.2.11	But when Peter was come to An´ti-och, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. 
GAL.2.12	For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. 
GAL.2.13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. 
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before 
GAL.2.15	We 
GAL.2.16	 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 
GAL.2.17	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, 
GAL.2.18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. 
GAL.2.19	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. 
GAL.2.20	I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 
GAL.2.21	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness 
GAL.3.1	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? 
GAL.3.2	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
GAL.3.3	Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? 
GAL.3.4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if 
GAL.3.5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, 
GAL.3.7	 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. 
GAL.3.8	 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, 
GAL.3.9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
GAL.3.10	Cursed 
GAL.3.10	which are written in the book of the law to do them.
GAL.3.12	 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. 
GAL.3.13	 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed 
GAL.3.14	that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
GAL.3.15	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though 
GAL.3.16	 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. 
GAL.3.17	 And this I say, 
GAL.3.18	 For if the inheritance 
GAL.3.19	Wherefore then 
GAL.3.20	Now a mediator is not 
GAL.3.22	But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
GAL.3.23	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterward be revealed. 
GAL.3.24	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster 
GAL.3.25	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. 
GAL.3.26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 
GAL.3.28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.29	 And if ye 
GAL.4.1	Now I say, 
GAL.4.2	but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. 
GAL.4.3	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: 
GAL.4.4	but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 
GAL.4.5	 to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. 
GAL.4.6	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 
GAL.4.7	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
GAL.4.8	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. 
GAL.4.9	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? 
GAL.4.10	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. 
GAL.4.11	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain.
GAL.4.12	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I 
GAL.4.13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. 
GAL.4.14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, 
GAL.4.15	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if 
GAL.4.16	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? 
GAL.4.17	They zealously affect you,
GAL.4.18	But 
GAL.4.19	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, 
GAL.4.20	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? 
GAL.4.22	 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a free woman. 
GAL.4.23	But he 
GAL.4.24	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Si´nai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Hagar. 
GAL.4.25	For this Hagar is Mount Si´nai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. 
GAL.4.26	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. 
GAL.4.27	 For it is written,
GAL.4.27	Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
GAL.4.27	break forth and cry, thou that travailest not:
GAL.4.27	for the desolate hath many more children
GAL.4.27	than she which hath a husband.
GAL.4.28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. 
GAL.4.29	 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him 
GAL.4.30	 Nevertheless what saith the Scripture?
GAL.4.30	Cast out the bondwoman and her son:
GAL.4.30	for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir
GAL.4.30	with the son of the free woman.
GAL.4.31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
GAL.5.1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
GAL.5.2	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. 
GAL.5.3	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 
GAL.5.4	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. 
GAL.5.5	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 
GAL.5.6	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
GAL.5.7	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? 
GAL.5.8	This persuasion 
GAL.5.9	 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 
GAL.5.10	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. 
GAL.5.11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased. 
GAL.5.12	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
GAL.5.13	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only 
GAL.5.14	 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, 
GAL.5.15	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
GAL.5.17	 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. 
GAL.5.18	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 
GAL.5.19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are 
GAL.5.20	idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 
GAL.5.21	envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told 
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 
GAL.5.23	meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 
GAL.5.24	And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
GAL.5.25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 
GAL.5.26	Let us not be desirous of vainglory, provoking one another, envying one another.
GAL.6.1	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. 
GAL.6.2	Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 
GAL.6.3	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 
GAL.6.4	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 
GAL.6.5	For every man shall bear his own burden.
GAL.6.6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
GAL.6.7	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. 
GAL.6.8	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. 
GAL.6.9	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. 
GAL.6.10	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all 
GAL.6.11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. 
GAL.6.12	As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 
GAL.6.13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. 
GAL.6.14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 
GAL.6.15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 
GAL.6.16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace 
GAL.6.17	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
GAL.6.18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
EPH.1.1	To the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
EPH.1.2	Grace 
EPH.1.3	Blessed 
EPH.1.4	according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: 
EPH.1.5	having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
EPH.1.6	to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved: 
EPH.1.7	 in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; 
EPH.1.8	wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; 
EPH.1.9	having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: 
EPH.1.10	that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; 
EPH.1.11	In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: 
EPH.1.12	that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. 
EPH.1.13	In whom ye also 
EPH.1.14	which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
EPH.1.15	Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, 
EPH.1.16	cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; 
EPH.1.17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: 
EPH.1.18	the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 
EPH.1.19	and what 
EPH.1.20	 which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set 
EPH.1.21	far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: 
EPH.1.22	 and hath put all 
EPH.1.23	which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
EPH.2.2	wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: 
EPH.2.3	among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. 
EPH.2.4	But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 
EPH.2.5	even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) 
EPH.2.6	and hath raised 
EPH.2.7	that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace, in 
EPH.2.8	For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: 
EPH.2.9	not of works, lest any man should boast. 
EPH.2.10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
EPH.2.11	Wherefore remember, that ye 
EPH.2.12	that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: 
EPH.2.13	but now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometime were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. 
EPH.2.14	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition 
EPH.2.15	 having abolished in his flesh the enmity, 
EPH.2.16	 and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: 
EPH.2.17	 and came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. 
EPH.2.18	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. 
EPH.2.19	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; 
EPH.2.20	and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner 
EPH.2.21	in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord: 
EPH.2.22	in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit.
EPH.3.1	For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, 
EPH.3.2	if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: 
EPH.3.3	how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words; 
EPH.3.4	 whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,) 
EPH.3.5	which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; 
EPH.3.6	that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.
EPH.3.7	Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. 
EPH.3.8	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 
EPH.3.9	and to make all 
EPH.3.10	to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly 
EPH.3.11	according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 
EPH.3.12	in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 
EPH.3.13	Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
EPH.3.14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
EPH.3.15	of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 
EPH.3.16	that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 
EPH.3.17	that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 
EPH.3.18	may be able to comprehend with all saints what 
EPH.3.19	and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.
EPH.3.20	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 
EPH.3.21	unto him 
EPH.4.1	I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, 
EPH.4.2	 with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; 
EPH.4.3	endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
EPH.4.4	 one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; 
EPH.4.5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of all, who 
EPH.4.7	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 
EPH.4.8	 Wherefore he saith,
EPH.4.8	When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive,
EPH.4.8	and gave gifts unto men.
EPH.4.9	(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? 
EPH.4.10	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) 
EPH.4.11	And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 
EPH.4.12	for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 
EPH.4.13	till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 
EPH.4.14	that we 
EPH.4.15	but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, 
EPH.4.16	 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
EPH.4.17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 
EPH.4.18	having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: 
EPH.4.19	who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. 
EPH.4.20	But ye have not so learned Christ; 
EPH.4.21	if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 
EPH.4.22	 that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; 
EPH.4.23	and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 
EPH.4.24	 and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
EPH.4.26	 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 
EPH.4.27	neither give place to the devil. 
EPH.4.28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with 
EPH.4.29	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. 
EPH.4.30	And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. 
EPH.4.31	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: 
EPH.4.32	 and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake
EPH.5.1	Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 
EPH.5.2	 and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savor.
EPH.5.3	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 
EPH.5.4	neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 
EPH.5.5	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 
EPH.5.6	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 
EPH.5.7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them. 
EPH.5.8	For ye were sometime darkness, but now 
EPH.5.9	(for the fruit of the Spirit 
EPH.5.10	proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. 
EPH.5.11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove 
EPH.5.12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. 
EPH.5.13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. 
EPH.5.14	Wherefore he saith,
EPH.5.14	Awake thou that sleepest,
EPH.5.14	and arise from the dead,
EPH.5.14	and Christ shall give thee light.
EPH.5.15	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 
EPH.5.16	 redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 
EPH.5.17	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord 
EPH.5.18	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; 
EPH.5.19	 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 
EPH.5.20	giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
EPH.5.21	submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
EPH.5.23	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. 
EPH.5.24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so 
EPH.5.25	 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 
EPH.5.26	that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 
EPH.5.27	that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 
EPH.5.28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. 
EPH.5.29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 
EPH.5.30	for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
EPH.5.31	 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. 
EPH.5.32	This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 
EPH.5.33	Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife 
EPH.6.2	 Honor thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; 
EPH.6.3	that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. 
EPH.6.4	 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
EPH.6.6	not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 
EPH.6.7	with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 
EPH.6.8	knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether 
EPH.6.9	 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
EPH.6.10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 
EPH.6.11	Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 
EPH.6.12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high 
EPH.6.13	Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 
EPH.6.14	 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 
EPH.6.15	 and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 
EPH.6.16	above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
EPH.6.17	 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 
EPH.6.18	praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; 
EPH.6.19	and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, 
EPH.6.20	for which I am an ambassador in bonds; that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
EPH.6.22	whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and 
EPH.6.23	Peace 
EPH.6.24	Grace 
PHP.1.1	To all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Phil´ippi, with the bishops and deacons:
PHP.1.2	Grace 
PHP.1.3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 
PHP.1.4	always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, 
PHP.1.5	for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 
PHP.1.6	being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform 
PHP.1.7	even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. 
PHP.1.8	For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 
PHP.1.9	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and 
PHP.1.10	that ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ; 
PHP.1.11	being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
PHP.1.12	But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things 
PHP.1.13	 so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other 
PHP.1.14	and many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
PHP.1.15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 
PHP.1.16	the one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: 
PHP.1.17	but the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel. 
PHP.1.18	What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
PHP.1.19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
PHP.1.20	according to my earnest expectation and 
PHP.1.21	For to me to live 
PHP.1.22	But if I live in the flesh, this 
PHP.1.23	For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: 
PHP.1.24	nevertheless to abide in the flesh 
PHP.1.25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
PHP.1.26	that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
PHP.1.27	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
PHP.1.28	and in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. 
PHP.1.29	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; 
PHP.1.30	 having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear 
PHP.2.1	If 
PHP.2.2	fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, 
PHP.2.3	 nothing 
PHP.2.4	Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. 
PHP.2.5	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 
PHP.2.6	who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 
PHP.2.7	but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 
PHP.2.8	and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 
PHP.2.9	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 
PHP.2.10	 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of 
PHP.2.11	and 
PHP.2.12	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: 
PHP.2.13	for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of 
PHP.2.14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 
PHP.2.15	 that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; 
PHP.2.16	holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain. 
PHP.2.17	Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 
PHP.2.18	For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
PHP.2.19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 
PHP.2.20	For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. 
PHP.2.21	For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. 
PHP.2.22	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. 
PHP.2.23	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. 
PHP.2.24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
PHP.2.25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphrodi´tus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. 
PHP.2.26	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. 
PHP.2.27	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 
PHP.2.28	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 
PHP.2.29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: 
PHP.2.30	because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
PHP.3.1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed 
PHP.3.2	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision. 
PHP.3.3	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. 
PHP.3.4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: 
PHP.3.5	 circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, 
PHP.3.6	 concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. 
PHP.3.7	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. 
PHP.3.8	Yea doubtless, and I count all things 
PHP.3.9	and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: 
PHP.3.10	that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; 
PHP.3.11	if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
PHP.3.12	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. 
PHP.3.13	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but 
PHP.3.14	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. 
PHP.3.15	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. 
PHP.3.16	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
PHP.3.18	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, 
PHP.3.19	whose end 
PHP.3.20	For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 
PHP.3.21	who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, 
PHP.4.2	I beseech Eu-o´di-as, and beseech Syn´tyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. 
PHP.4.3	And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and 
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord always: 
PHP.4.5	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord 
PHP.4.6	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.8	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things 
PHP.4.9	Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
PHP.4.10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. 
PHP.4.11	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, 
PHP.4.12	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 
PHP.4.13	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
PHP.4.14	Notwithstanding, ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. 
PHP.4.15	 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedo´nia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 
PHP.4.16	 For even in Thessaloni´ca ye sent once and again unto my necessity. 
PHP.4.17	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 
PHP.4.18	 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphrodi´tus the things 
PHP.4.19	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. 
PHP.4.20	Now unto God and our Father 
PHP.4.21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. 
PHP.4.22	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.
PHP.4.23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
COL.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy 
COL.1.2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colos´sae:
COL.1.2	Grace 
COL.1.3	We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, 
COL.1.4	since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love 
COL.1.5	for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; 
COL.1.6	which is come unto you, as 
COL.1.7	 as ye also learned of
COL.1.8	who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
COL.1.9	For this cause we also, since the day we heard 
COL.1.10	that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing,
COL.1.11	strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness; 
COL.1.12	giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: 
COL.1.13	who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated 
COL.1.15	who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: 
COL.1.16	for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether 
COL.1.17	and he is before all things, and by him all things consist: 
COL.1.18	 and he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. 
COL.1.19	For it pleased 
COL.1.20	 and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, 
COL.1.21	And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in 
COL.1.22	in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight: 
COL.1.23	if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and 
COL.1.24	who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church: 
COL.1.25	whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; 
COL.1.26	 the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: 
COL.1.27	to whom God would make known what 
COL.1.28	whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: 
COL.1.29	whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
COL.2.1	For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and 
COL.2.2	that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and
COL.2.3	in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
COL.2.4	And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. 
COL.2.5	For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
COL.2.6	As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, 
COL.2.7	rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
COL.2.8	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. 
COL.2.9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. 
COL.2.10	And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: 
COL.2.11	in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: 
COL.2.12	 buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with 
COL.2.13	 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; 
COL.2.14	 blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; 
COL.2.15	 having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
COL.2.17	which are a shadow of things to come; but the body 
COL.2.18	Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, 
COL.2.19	 and not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.
COL.2.20	Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, 
COL.2.21	(touch not; taste not; handle not; 
COL.2.22	which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men? 
COL.2.23	which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.
COL.3.2	Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. 
COL.3.3	For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	When Christ, 
COL.3.5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 
COL.3.6	for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 
COL.3.7	in the which ye also walked sometime, when ye lived in them. 
COL.3.8	But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. 
COL.3.9	 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; 
COL.3.10	 and have put on the new 
COL.3.11	where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scyth´i-an, bond 
COL.3.13	 forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also 
COL.3.14	And above all these things 
COL.3.15	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. 
COL.3.16	 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. 
COL.3.17	And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, 
COL.3.19	 Husbands, love 
COL.3.20	 Children, obey 
COL.3.21	 Fathers, provoke not your children 
COL.3.22	 Servants, obey in all things 
COL.3.23	and whatsoever ye do, do 
COL.3.24	knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. 
COL.3.25	 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
COL.4.2	Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; 
COL.4.3	withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: 
COL.4.4	that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
COL.4.6	Let your speech 
COL.4.8	whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; 
COL.4.9	 with Ones´imus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is 
COL.4.11	and Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only 
COL.4.12	 Ep´aphras, who is 
COL.4.13	For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them 
COL.4.14	 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you. 
COL.4.15	Salute the brethren which are in La-odice´a, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. 
COL.4.16	And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the La-odice´ans; and that ye likewise read the 
COL.4.17	 And say to Archip´pus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.
COL.4.18	The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace 
1TH.1.1	Unto the church of the Thessalo´ni-ans 
1TH.1.1	Grace 
1TH.1.2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; 
1TH.1.3	remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; 
1TH.1.4	knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
1TH.1.5	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake. 
1TH.1.6	 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost: 
1TH.1.7	so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedo´nia and Achai´a. 
1TH.1.8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedo´nia and Achai´a, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. 
1TH.1.9	For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God; 
1TH.1.10	and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, 
1TH.2.1	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain: 
1TH.2.2	 but even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Phil´ippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention. 
1TH.2.3	For our exhortation 
1TH.2.4	but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God 
1TH.2.6	nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor 
1TH.2.7	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children: 
1TH.2.8	so being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
1TH.2.9	For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. 
1TH.2.10	Ye 
1TH.2.11	as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father 
1TH.2.12	that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.13	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received 
1TH.2.14	 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they 
1TH.2.15	 who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: 
1TH.2.16	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
1TH.2.17	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire. 
1TH.2.18	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us. 
1TH.2.19	For what 
1TH.2.20	For ye are our glory and joy.
1TH.3.2	and sent Timothy, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 
1TH.3.3	that no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto. 
1TH.3.4	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know. 
1TH.3.5	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.
1TH.3.7	therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith: 
1TH.3.8	for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. 
1TH.3.9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; 
1TH.3.10	night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
1TH.3.11	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you. 
1TH.3.12	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all 
1TH.3.13	to the end he may stablish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
1TH.4.1	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort 
1TH.4.2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. 
1TH.4.3	For this is the will of God, 
1TH.4.4	that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor; 
1TH.4.5	not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: 
1TH.4.6	that no 
1TH.4.7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. 
1TH.4.8	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit.
1TH.4.9	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. 
1TH.4.10	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedo´nia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; 
1TH.4.11	and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; 
1TH.4.12	that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and 
1TH.4.13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. 
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 
1TH.4.15	 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive 
1TH.4.16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 
1TH.4.17	then we which are alive 
1TH.4.18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
1TH.5.1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. 
1TH.5.2	 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. 
1TH.5.3	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. 
1TH.5.4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. 
1TH.5.5	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. 
1TH.5.6	Therefore let us not sleep, as 
1TH.5.7	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. 
1TH.5.8	 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. 
1TH.5.9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TH.5.10	who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 
1TH.5.11	Wherefore comfort
1TH.5.12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 
1TH.5.13	and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. 
1TH.5.14	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all 
1TH.5.15	See that none render evil for evil unto any 
1TH.5.16	Rejoice evermore. 
1TH.5.17	Pray without ceasing. 
1TH.5.18	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 
1TH.5.19	Quench not the Spirit. 
1TH.5.20	Despise not prophesyings. 
1TH.5.21	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 
1TH.5.22	Abstain from all appearance
1TH.5.23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and 
1TH.5.24	Faithful 
1TH.5.25	Brethren, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
1TH.5.27	I charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
2TH.1.1	Unto the church of the Thessalo´ni-ans in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2TH.1.2	Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.3	We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; 
2TH.1.4	so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: 
2TH.1.5	 a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer: 
2TH.1.6	seeing 
2TH.1.7	and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, 
2TH.1.8	in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
2TH.1.9	who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; 
2TH.1.10	when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
2TH.1.11	Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of 
2TH.1.12	that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.2	that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. 
2TH.2.3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for 
2TH.2.4	 who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God
2TH.2.5	Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 
2TH.2.6	And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time. 
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth 
2TH.2.8	 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: 
2TH.2.10	and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 
2TH.2.11	And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 
2TH.2.12	that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2TH.2.13	But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: 
2TH.2.14	whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2TH.2.15	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.
2TH.2.16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given 
2TH.2.17	comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
2TH.3.1	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have 
2TH.3.2	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all 
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep 
2TH.3.4	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you. 
2TH.3.5	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for
2TH.3.6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. 
2TH.3.7	For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; 
2TH.3.8	neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you: 
2TH.3.9	not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us. 
2TH.3.10	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. 
2TH.3.11	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. 
2TH.3.12	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. 
2TH.3.13	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
2TH.3.14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. 
2TH.3.15	Yet count 
2TH.3.16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord 
2TH.3.17	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. 
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
1TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TI.1.2	Grace, mercy, 
1TI.1.3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedo´nia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, 
1TI.1.4	neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: 
1TI.1.5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and 
1TI.1.6	from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; 
1TI.1.7	desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
1TI.1.8	But we know that the law 
1TI.1.9	knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 
1TI.1.10	for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; 
1TI.1.11	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
1TI.1.12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 
1TI.1.13	 who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did 
1TI.1.14	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
1TI.1.15	This 
1TI.1.16	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. 
1TI.1.17	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, 
1TI.1.18	This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; 
1TI.1.19	holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away, concerning faith have made shipwreck: 
1TI.1.20	of whom is Hymene´us and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
1TI.2.1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, 
1TI.2.2	for kings, and 
1TI.2.3	For this 
1TI.2.4	who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 
1TI.2.5	For 
1TI.2.6	who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. 
1TI.2.7	 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, 
1TI.2.8	I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. 
1TI.2.9	 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; 
1TI.2.10	but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. 
1TI.2.11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. 
1TI.2.12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. 
1TI.2.13	 For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 
1TI.2.14	 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. 
1TI.2.15	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
1TI.3.1	This 
1TI.3.2	 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach; 
1TI.3.3	not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; 
1TI.3.4	one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; 
1TI.3.5	(for if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) 
1TI.3.6	not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he
1TI.3.7	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
1TI.3.8	Likewise 
1TI.3.9	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 
1TI.3.10	And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being 
1TI.3.11	Even so 
1TI.3.12	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. 
1TI.3.13	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: 
1TI.3.15	but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. 
1TI.3.16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness:
1TI.3.16	God
1TI.3.16	justified in the Spirit,
1TI.3.16	seen of angels,
1TI.3.16	preached unto the Gentiles,
1TI.3.16	believed on in the world,
1TI.3.16	received up into glory.
1TI.4.1	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 
1TI.4.2	speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 
1TI.4.3	forbidding to marry, 
1TI.4.4	For every creature of God 
1TI.4.5	for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
1TI.4.6	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. 
1TI.4.7	But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself 
1TI.4.8	For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 
1TI.4.9	This 
1TI.4.10	For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
1TI.4.11	These things command and teach. 
1TI.4.12	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
1TI.4.13	Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 
1TI.4.14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 
1TI.4.15	Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. 
1TI.4.16	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
1TI.5.1	Rebuke not an elder,
1TI.5.2	the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
1TI.5.3	Honor widows that are widows indeed. 
1TI.5.4	But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God. 
1TI.5.5	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. 
1TI.5.6	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. 
1TI.5.7	And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless. 
1TI.5.8	But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
1TI.5.9	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, 
1TI.5.10	well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work. 
1TI.5.11	But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; 
1TI.5.12	having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. 
1TI.5.13	And withal they learn 
1TI.5.14	I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. 
1TI.5.15	For some are already turned aside after Satan. 
1TI.5.16	If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
1TI.5.17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine. 
1TI.5.18	 For the Scripture saith,
1TI.5.18	Thou shalt not muzzle the ox
1TI.5.18	that treadeth out the corn.
1TI.5.18	And,
1TI.5.18	The laborer 
1TI.5.20	Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. 
1TI.5.21	I charge 
1TI.5.22	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.
1TI.5.23	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.
1TI.5.24	Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some 
1TI.5.25	Likewise also the good works 
1TI.6.1	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and 
1TI.6.2	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise 
1TI.6.2	These things teach and exhort. 
1TI.6.3	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, 
1TI.6.4	he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 
1TI.6.5	perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself. 
1TI.6.6	But godliness with contentment is great gain. 
1TI.6.7	For we brought nothing into 
1TI.6.8	And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. 
1TI.6.9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
1TI.6.11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. 
1TI.6.13	 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and 
1TI.6.14	that thou keep 
1TI.6.15	which in his times he shall show, 
1TI.6.16	who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom 
1TI.6.17	Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; 
1TI.6.18	that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; 
1TI.6.19	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
1TI.6.20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane 
1TI.6.21	which some professing have erred concerning the faith.
1TI.6.21	Grace 
2TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
2TI.1.2	Grace, mercy, 
2TI.1.3	I thank God, whom I serve from 
2TI.1.4	greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 
2TI.1.5	 when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. 
2TI.1.6	Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. 
2TI.1.7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
2TI.1.8	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; 
2TI.1.9	who hath saved us, and called 
2TI.1.10	but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel: 
2TI.1.11	 whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 
2TI.1.12	For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. 
2TI.1.13	Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.1.14	That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
2TI.1.15	This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygel´lus and Hermog´enes. 
2TI.1.16	The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiph´orus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: 
2TI.1.17	but, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found 
2TI.1.18	The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
2TI.2.1	Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.2	And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 
2TI.2.3	Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 
2TI.2.4	No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of 
2TI.2.5	And if a man also strive for masteries, 
2TI.2.6	The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits. 
2TI.2.7	Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
2TI.2.8	Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead, according to my gospel: 
2TI.2.9	wherein I suffer trouble, as an evildoer, 
2TI.2.10	Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 
2TI.2.11	 a faithful saying:
2TI.2.11	For if we be dead with 
2TI.2.12	if we deny 
2TI.2.13	if we believe not, 
2TI.2.13	he cannot deny himself.
2TI.2.14	Of these things put 
2TI.2.15	Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
2TI.2.16	But shun profane 
2TI.2.17	And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymene´us and Phile´tus; 
2TI.2.18	who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 
2TI.2.19	Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ
2TI.2.20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor. 
2TI.2.21	If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, 
2TI.2.22	Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
2TI.2.23	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. 
2TI.2.24	And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all 
2TI.2.25	in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; 
2TI.2.26	and 
2TI.3.1	This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 
2TI.3.2	For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
2TI.3.3	without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 
2TI.3.4	traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 
2TI.3.5	having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 
2TI.3.6	For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 
2TI.3.7	ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
2TI.3.8	 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
2TI.3.9	But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all 
2TI.3.10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience, 
2TI.3.11	 persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at An´ti-och, at Ico´ni-um, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of 
2TI.3.12	Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 
2TI.3.13	But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. 
2TI.3.14	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned 
2TI.3.15	and that from a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	All Scripture 
2TI.3.17	that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.
2TI.4.1	I charge 
2TI.4.2	preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine. 
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; 
2TI.4.4	and they shall turn away 
2TI.4.5	But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
2TI.4.6	For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. 
2TI.4.7	I have fought a good fight, I have finished 
2TI.4.8	henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
2TI.4.9	Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 
2TI.4.10	 for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessaloni´ca; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalma´tia. 
2TI.4.11	 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. 
2TI.4.12	 And Tych´icus have I sent to Ephesus. 
2TI.4.13	 The cloak that I left at Tro´as with Carpus, when thou comest, bring 
2TI.4.14	 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: 
2TI.4.15	of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words. 
2TI.4.16	At my first answer no man stood with me, but all 
2TI.4.17	Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and 
2TI.4.18	And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve 
2TI.4.20	 Eras´tus abode at Corinth: but Troph´imus have I left at Mile´tus sick. 
2TI.4.21	Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubu´lus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
2TI.4.22	The Lord Jesus Christ 
TIT.1.1	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 
TIT.1.2	in hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; 
TIT.1.3	but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
TIT.1.4	Grace, mercy, 
TIT.1.5	For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: 
TIT.1.6	 if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 
TIT.1.7	For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; 
TIT.1.8	but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men,
TIT.1.9	holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 
TIT.1.10	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: 
TIT.1.11	whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. 
TIT.1.12	One of themselves, 
TIT.1.13	This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 
TIT.1.14	not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. 
TIT.1.15	Unto the pure all things 
TIT.1.16	They profess that they know God; but in works they deny 
TIT.2.1	But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 
TIT.2.2	that the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 
TIT.2.3	The aged women likewise, that 
TIT.2.4	that they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 
TIT.2.5	 discreet, chaste, keepers
TIT.2.6	Young men likewise exhort to be soberminded. 
TIT.2.7	In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine 
TIT.2.8	sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. 
TIT.2.9	 servants to be obedient unto their own masters, 
TIT.2.10	not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 
TIT.2.12	teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 
TIT.2.13	looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 
TIT.2.14	 who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
TIT.2.15	These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
TIT.3.1	Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 
TIT.3.2	to speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, 
TIT.3.3	For we ourselves also were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, 
TIT.3.4	But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, 
TIT.3.5	not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 
TIT.3.6	which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 
TIT.3.7	that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
TIT.3.9	But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 
TIT.3.10	A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject; 
TIT.3.11	knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.
TIT.3.13	 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apol´los on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. 
TIT.3.14	And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
TIT.3.15	All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith.
TIT.3.15	Grace 
PHM.1.1	Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy 
PHM.1.1	Unto Phile´mon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer, 
PHM.1.2	 and to 
PHM.1.3	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHM.1.4	I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 
PHM.1.5	hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 
PHM.1.6	that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
PHM.1.7	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
PHM.1.8	Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, 
PHM.1.9	yet for love's sake I rather beseech 
PHM.1.10	 I beseech thee for my son Ones´imus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: 
PHM.1.11	which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: 
PHM.1.12	whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 
PHM.1.13	whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 
PHM.1.14	but without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
PHM.1.15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; 
PHM.1.16	not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? 
PHM.1.17	If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 
PHM.1.18	If he hath wronged thee, or oweth 
PHM.1.19	I Paul have written 
PHM.1.20	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
PHM.1.21	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. 
PHM.1.22	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
PHM.1.24	 Mark, Aristar´chus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers.
PHM.1.25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
HEB.1.1	God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 
HEB.1.2	hath in these last days spoken unto us by 
HEB.1.3	who being the brightness of 
HEB.1.4	being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
HEB.1.5	Thou art my Son,
HEB.1.5	this day have I begotten thee?
HEB.1.5	And again,
HEB.1.5	I will be to him a Father,
HEB.1.5	and he shall be to me a Son?
HEB.1.6	And let all the angels of God worship him.
HEB.1.7	Who maketh his angels spirits,
HEB.1.7	and his ministers a flame of fire.
HEB.1.8	Thy throne, O God, 
HEB.1.8	a sceptre of righteousness 
HEB.1.9	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;
HEB.1.9	therefore God, 
HEB.1.9	with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
HEB.1.10	Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth;
HEB.1.10	and the heavens are the works of thine hands.
HEB.1.11	They shall perish, but thou remainest:
HEB.1.11	and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
HEB.1.12	and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up,
HEB.1.12	and they shall be changed:
HEB.1.12	but thou art the same,
HEB.1.12	and thy years shall not fail.
HEB.1.13	Sit on my right hand,
HEB.1.13	until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
HEB.1.14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
HEB.2.1	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let 
HEB.2.2	For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward; 
HEB.2.3	how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard 
HEB.2.4	God also bearing 
HEB.2.5	For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. 
HEB.2.6	 But one in a certain place testified, saying,
HEB.2.6	What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
HEB.2.6	or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
HEB.2.7	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels;
HEB.2.7	thou crownedst him with glory and honor,
HEB.2.7	and didst set him over the works of thy hands:
HEB.2.8	thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.
HEB.2.8	For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing 
HEB.2.9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
HEB.2.10	For it became him, for whom 
HEB.2.11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified 
HEB.2.12	 saying,
HEB.2.12	I will declare thy name unto my brethren,
HEB.2.12	in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.
HEB.2.13	I will put my trust in him.
HEB.2.13	And again,
HEB.2.13	Behold I and the children which God hath given me.
HEB.2.14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; 
HEB.2.15	and deliver them, who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. 
HEB.2.16	For verily he took not on 
HEB.2.17	Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto 
HEB.2.18	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.
HEB.3.1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; 
HEB.3.2	 who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses 
HEB.3.3	For this 
HEB.3.4	For every house is builded by some 
HEB.3.5	And Moses verily 
HEB.3.6	but Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
HEB.3.7	Today if ye will hear his voice,
HEB.3.8	harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,
HEB.3.8	in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
HEB.3.9	when your fathers tempted me, proved me,
HEB.3.9	and saw my works forty years.
HEB.3.10	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation,
HEB.3.10	and said, They do always err in 
HEB.3.10	and they have not known my ways.
HEB.3.11	So I sware in my wrath,
HEB.3.11	They shall not enter into my rest.
HEB.3.12	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. 
HEB.3.13	But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 
HEB.3.14	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end; 
HEB.3.15	 while it is said,
HEB.3.15	Today if ye will hear his voice,
HEB.3.15	harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
HEB.3.17	But with whom was he grieved forty years? 
HEB.3.18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? 
HEB.3.19	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
HEB.4.1	Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left 
HEB.4.2	For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard 
HEB.4.3	 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said,
HEB.4.3	As I have sworn in my wrath,
HEB.4.3	if they shall enter into my rest:
HEB.4.3	although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 
HEB.4.4	 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh 
HEB.4.4	And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
HEB.4.5	If they shall enter into my rest.
HEB.4.6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: 
HEB.4.7	 again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, Today, after so long a time; as it is said,
HEB.4.7	Today if ye will hear his voice,
HEB.4.7	harden not your hearts.
HEB.4.9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. 
HEB.4.10	 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God 
HEB.4.11	Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. 
HEB.4.12	For the word of God 
HEB.4.13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things 
HEB.4.14	Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast 
HEB.4.15	For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as 
HEB.4.16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
HEB.5.1	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things 
HEB.5.2	who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. 
HEB.5.3	 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. 
HEB.5.4	 And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as 
HEB.5.5	Thou art my Son,
HEB.5.5	today have I begotten thee.
HEB.5.6	Thou 
HEB.5.6	after the order of Melchiz´edek.
HEB.5.8	though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; 
HEB.5.9	and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; 
HEB.5.10	called of God a high priest after the order of Melchiz´edek.
HEB.5.11	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing. 
HEB.5.12	 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which 
HEB.5.13	For every one that useth milk 
HEB.5.14	But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, 
HEB.6.1	Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
HEB.6.2	of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. 
HEB.6.3	And this will we do, if God permit. 
HEB.6.4	For 
HEB.6.5	and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, 
HEB.6.6	if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put 
HEB.6.7	For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: 
HEB.6.8	 but that which beareth thorns and briers 
HEB.6.9	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. 
HEB.6.10	For God 
HEB.6.11	And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: 
HEB.6.12	that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
HEB.6.13	For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, 
HEB.6.14	 saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. 
HEB.6.15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. 
HEB.6.16	For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation 
HEB.6.17	Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed 
HEB.6.18	that by two immutable things, in which 
HEB.6.19	 which 
HEB.6.20	 whither the forerunner is for us entered, 
HEB.7.2	to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; 
HEB.7.3	without father, without mother, without descent,
HEB.7.4	Now consider how great this man 
HEB.7.5	 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: 
HEB.7.6	but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. 
HEB.7.7	And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. 
HEB.7.8	And here men that die receive tithes; but there he 
HEB.7.9	And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham. 
HEB.7.10	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchiz´edek met him.
HEB.7.11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need 
HEB.7.12	For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. 
HEB.7.13	For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. 
HEB.7.14	For 
HEB.7.15	And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchiz´edek there ariseth another priest, 
HEB.7.16	who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. 
HEB.7.17	 For he testifieth,
HEB.7.17	Thou 
HEB.7.17	after the order of Melchiz´edek.
HEB.7.18	For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. 
HEB.7.19	For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope 
HEB.7.20	And inasmuch as not without an oath 
HEB.7.21	 (for those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him,
HEB.7.21	The Lord sware and will not repent,
HEB.7.21	Thou 
HEB.7.21	after the order of Melchiz´edek:)
HEB.7.22	by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
HEB.7.23	And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: 
HEB.7.24	but this 
HEB.7.25	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
HEB.7.26	For such a high priest became us, 
HEB.7.27	 who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. 
HEB.7.28	For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, 
HEB.8.2	a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. 
HEB.8.3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore 
HEB.8.4	For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: 
HEB.8.5	 who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, 
HEB.8.6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. 
HEB.8.7	For if that first 
HEB.8.8	Behold, the days come, saith the Lord,
HEB.8.8	when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
HEB.8.9	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,
HEB.8.9	in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;
HEB.8.9	because they continued not in my covenant,
HEB.8.9	and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
HEB.8.10	For this 
HEB.8.10	after those days, saith the Lord;
HEB.8.10	I will put my laws into their mind,
HEB.8.10	and write them in their hearts:
HEB.8.10	and I will be to them a God,
HEB.8.10	and they shall be to me a people:
HEB.8.11	and they shall not teach every man his neighbor,
HEB.8.11	and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord:
HEB.8.11	for all shall know me,
HEB.8.11	from the least to the greatest.
HEB.8.12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness,
HEB.8.12	and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
HEB.8.13	In that he saith, A new 
HEB.9.1	Then verily the first 
HEB.9.2	 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein 
HEB.9.3	 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all; 
HEB.9.4	 which had the golden censer,
HEB.9.5	 and over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
HEB.9.7	 But into the second 
HEB.9.8	the Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: 
HEB.9.9	which 
HEB.9.10	 only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed 
HEB.9.11	But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; 
HEB.9.12	neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption 
HEB.9.13	 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; 
HEB.9.14	how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
HEB.9.15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions 
HEB.9.16	For where a testament 
HEB.9.17	For a testament 
HEB.9.18	Whereupon neither the first 
HEB.9.19	 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book and all the people, 
HEB.9.20	saying, This 
HEB.9.21	 Moreover he sprinkled likewise with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. 
HEB.9.22	 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
HEB.9.24	For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, 
HEB.9.25	nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; 
HEB.9.26	for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
HEB.9.27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: 
HEB.9.28	so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
HEB.10.1	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, 
HEB.10.2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. 
HEB.10.3	But in those 
HEB.10.4	For 
HEB.10.5	Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not,
HEB.10.5	but a body hast thou prepared me:
HEB.10.6	in burnt offerings and 
HEB.10.7	Then said I, Lo, I come
HEB.10.7	(in the volume of the book it is written of me)
HEB.10.7	to do thy will, O God.
HEB.10.8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and 
HEB.10.9	then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. 
HEB.10.10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once 
HEB.10.12	 but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; 
HEB.10.13	from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. 
HEB.10.14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. 
HEB.10.15	 the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
HEB.10.16	after those days, saith the Lord;
HEB.10.16	I will put my laws into their hearts,
HEB.10.16	and in their minds will I write them;
HEB.10.18	Now where remission of these 
HEB.10.19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, 
HEB.10.20	by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 
HEB.10.21	and 
HEB.10.22	 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 
HEB.10.23	Let us hold fast the profession of 
HEB.10.24	and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: 
HEB.10.25	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some 
HEB.10.26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, 
HEB.10.27	 but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. 
HEB.10.28	 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: 
HEB.10.29	 of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? 
HEB.10.30	 For we know him that hath said,
HEB.10.30	Vengeance 
HEB.10.30	I will recompense, saith the Lord.
HEB.10.30	And again,
HEB.10.30	The Lord shall judge his people.
HEB.10.32	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; 
HEB.10.33	partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. 
HEB.10.34	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds,
HEB.10.35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. 
HEB.10.36	For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
HEB.10.37	and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
HEB.10.38	Now the just shall live by faith:
HEB.10.38	but if 
HEB.10.38	my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
HEB.10.39	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
HEB.11.1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 
HEB.11.2	For by it the elders obtained a good report. 
HEB.11.3	 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
HEB.11.5	 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 
HEB.11.6	But without faith 
HEB.11.7	 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
HEB.11.9	 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as 
HEB.11.10	for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker 
HEB.11.11	 Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. 
HEB.11.12	 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, 
HEB.11.14	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. 
HEB.11.15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that 
HEB.11.16	But now they desire a better 
HEB.11.18	 of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: 
HEB.11.19	accounting that God 
HEB.11.20	 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 
HEB.11.21	 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, 
HEB.11.22	 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
HEB.11.24	 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
HEB.11.25	choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; 
HEB.11.26	esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward. 
HEB.11.27	 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 
HEB.11.28	 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
HEB.11.30	 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. 
HEB.11.31	 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.
HEB.11.33	 who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 
HEB.11.34	 quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. 
HEB.11.35	 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: 
HEB.11.36	 and others had trial of 
HEB.11.37	 they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; 
HEB.11.38	of whom the world was not worthy: they wandered in deserts, and 
HEB.11.39	And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: 
HEB.11.40	God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
HEB.12.1	Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset 
HEB.12.2	looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of 
HEB.12.3	For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. 
HEB.12.4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. 
HEB.12.5	 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children,
HEB.12.5	My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,
HEB.12.5	nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
HEB.12.6	for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,
HEB.12.6	and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
HEB.12.7	If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? 
HEB.12.8	But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. 
HEB.12.9	Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected 
HEB.12.10	For they verily for a few days chastened 
HEB.12.11	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
HEB.12.13	 and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. 
HEB.12.14	Follow peace with all 
HEB.12.15	 looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble 
HEB.12.16	 lest there 
HEB.12.17	 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
HEB.12.19	and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which 
HEB.12.20	 (for they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
HEB.12.21	 and so terrible was the sight, 
HEB.12.22	but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, 
HEB.12.23	to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, 
HEB.12.24	 and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than 
HEB.12.26	 whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. 
HEB.12.27	And this 
HEB.12.28	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: 
HEB.12.29	 for our God 
HEB.13.1	Let brotherly love continue. 
HEB.13.2	 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. 
HEB.13.3	Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; 
HEB.13.4	Marriage 
HEB.13.5	I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
HEB.13.6	The Lord 
HEB.13.6	and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
HEB.13.7	Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever. 
HEB.13.9	Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines: for 
HEB.13.10	We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. 
HEB.13.11	 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. 
HEB.13.12	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. 
HEB.13.13	Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 
HEB.13.14	For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. 
HEB.13.15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of 
HEB.13.16	But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
HEB.13.17	Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that 
HEB.13.18	Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. 
HEB.13.19	But I beseech 
HEB.13.20	Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, 
HEB.13.21	make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom 
HEB.13.22	And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words. 
HEB.13.23	Know ye that 
HEB.13.24	Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. 
HEB.13.25	Grace 
JAS.1.1	To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad,
JAS.1.1	Greeting.
JAS.1.2	My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 
JAS.1.3	knowing 
JAS.1.4	But let patience have 
JAS.1.5	If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all 
JAS.1.6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 
JAS.1.7	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. 
JAS.1.8	A double-minded man 
JAS.1.9	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 
JAS.1.10	 but the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. 
JAS.1.11	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
JAS.1.12	Blessed 
JAS.1.13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: 
JAS.1.14	but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. 
JAS.1.15	Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it is finished,
JAS.1.16	Do not err, my beloved brethren. 
JAS.1.17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. 
JAS.1.18	Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
JAS.1.19	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: 
JAS.1.20	for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. 
JAS.1.21	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
JAS.1.22	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. 
JAS.1.23	For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: 
JAS.1.24	for he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. 
JAS.1.25	But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth 
JAS.1.26	If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion 
JAS.1.27	Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, 
JAS.2.1	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
JAS.2.2	For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 
JAS.2.3	and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: 
JAS.2.4	are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? 
JAS.2.5	Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 
JAS.2.6	But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? 
JAS.2.7	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
JAS.2.9	but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. 
JAS.2.10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one 
JAS.2.11	 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. 
JAS.2.12	So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. 
JAS.2.13	For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
JAS.2.14	What 
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, 
JAS.2.16	and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be 
JAS.2.17	Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
JAS.2.18	Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works. 
JAS.2.19	Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. 
JAS.2.20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 
JAS.2.21	 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 
JAS.2.22	Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? 
JAS.2.23	 And the Scripture was fulfilled which saith,
JAS.2.23	Abraham believed God,
JAS.2.23	and it was imputed unto him for righteousness:
JAS.2.23	and he was called the Friend of God. 
JAS.2.24	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 
JAS.2.25	 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent 
JAS.2.26	For as the body without the spirit
JAS.3.1	My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. 
JAS.3.2	For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same 
JAS.3.3	Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. 
JAS.3.4	Behold also the ships, which though 
JAS.3.5	Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
JAS.3.6	And the tongue 
JAS.3.7	For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: 
JAS.3.8	but the tongue can no man tame; 
JAS.3.9	 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. 
JAS.3.10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. 
JAS.3.11	Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet 
JAS.3.12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so 
JAS.3.13	Who 
JAS.3.14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 
JAS.3.15	This wisdom descendeth not from above, but 
JAS.3.16	For where envying and strife 
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, 
JAS.3.18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
JAS.4.1	From whence 
JAS.4.2	Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 
JAS.4.3	Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume 
JAS.4.4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. 
JAS.4.5	Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth
JAS.4.6	 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith,
JAS.4.6	God resisteth the proud,
JAS.4.6	but giveth grace unto the humble.
JAS.4.7	Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
JAS.4.8	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse 
JAS.4.9	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
JAS.4.11	Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of 
JAS.4.12	There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
JAS.4.14	whereas ye know not what 
JAS.4.15	For that ye 
JAS.4.16	But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. 
JAS.4.17	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth 
JAS.5.1	Go to now, 
JAS.5.2	 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. 
JAS.5.4	 Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sab´a-oth. 
JAS.5.5	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. 
JAS.5.6	Ye have condemned 
JAS.5.7	Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. 
JAS.5.8	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. 
JAS.5.9	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. 
JAS.5.10	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. 
JAS.5.11	 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
JAS.5.13	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. 
JAS.5.14	 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: 
JAS.5.15	and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. 
JAS.5.16	Confess 
JAS.5.17	 Eli´jah was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. 
JAS.5.18	 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
JAS.5.19	Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; 
JAS.5.20	 let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
1PE.1.1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
1PE.1.1	To the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappado´cia, Asia, and Bithyn´i-a, 
1PE.1.2	elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ:
1PE.1.2	Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
1PE.1.3	Blessed 
1PE.1.4	to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 
1PE.1.5	who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
1PE.1.6	Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: 
1PE.1.7	that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 
1PE.1.8	whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see 
1PE.1.9	receiving the end of your faith, 
1PE.1.10	Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace 
1PE.1.11	searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. 
1PE.1.12	Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
1PE.1.13	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 
1PE.1.14	as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: 
1PE.1.15	but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; 
1PE.1.16	 because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. 
1PE.1.17	And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning 
1PE.1.18	forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, 
1PE.1.19	but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: 
1PE.1.20	who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, 
1PE.1.21	who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
1PE.1.22	Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, 
1PE.1.23	being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.
1PE.1.24	and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.
1PE.1.24	The grass withereth,
1PE.1.24	and the flower thereof falleth away:
1PE.1.25	but the word of the Lord endureth for ever.
1PE.1.25	And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
1PE.2.1	Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, 
1PE.2.2	as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: 
1PE.2.3	 if so be ye have tasted that the Lord 
1PE.2.4	To whom coming, 
1PE.2.5	ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 
1PE.2.6	 Wherefore also it is contained in the Scripture,
1PE.2.6	Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious:
1PE.2.6	and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
1PE.2.7	the stone which the builders disallowed,
1PE.2.7	the same is made the head of the corner,
1PE.2.8	and a rock of offense,
1PE.2.10	 which in time past 
1PE.2.11	Dearly beloved, I beseech 
1PE.2.12	having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by 
1PE.2.13	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; 
1PE.2.14	or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. 
1PE.2.15	For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: 
1PE.2.16	as free, and not using 
1PE.2.17	Honor all 
1PE.2.18	Servants, 
1PE.2.19	For this 
1PE.2.20	For what glory 
1PE.2.21	For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: 
1PE.2.22	 who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 
1PE.2.23	 who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed 
1PE.2.24	 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. 
1PE.2.25	 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
1PE.3.2	while they behold your chaste conversation 
1PE.3.3	 Whose adorning, let it not be that outward 
1PE.3.4	but 
1PE.3.5	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: 
1PE.3.6	 even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
1PE.3.8	Finally, 
1PE.3.9	not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
1PE.3.10	and see good days,
1PE.3.10	let him refrain his tongue from evil,
1PE.3.10	and his lips that they speak no guile:
1PE.3.11	let him eschew evil, and do good;
1PE.3.11	let him seek peace, and ensue it.
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the Lord 
1PE.3.12	and his ears 
1PE.3.12	but the face of the Lord 
1PE.3.13	And who 
1PE.3.15	but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and 
1PE.3.16	having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. 
1PE.3.17	For 
1PE.3.18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: 
1PE.3.19	by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; 
1PE.3.20	 which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. 
1PE.3.21	The like figure whereunto 
1PE.3.22	who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
1PE.4.1	Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; 
1PE.4.2	that he no longer should live the rest of 
1PE.4.3	For the time past of 
1PE.4.4	wherein they think it strange that ye run not with 
1PE.4.5	who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. 
1PE.4.6	For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
1PE.4.7	But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. 
1PE.4.8	 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. 
1PE.4.9	Use hospitality one to another without grudging. 
1PE.4.10	As every man hath received the gift, 
1PE.4.11	If any man speak, 
1PE.4.12	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: 
1PE.4.13	but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. 
1PE.4.14	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy 
1PE.4.15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or 
1PE.4.16	Yet if 
1PE.4.17	For the time 
1PE.4.18	 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? 
1PE.4.19	Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls 
1PE.5.1	The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 
1PE.5.2	 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight 
1PE.5.3	neither as being lords over 
1PE.5.4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. 
1PE.5.5	 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all 
1PE.5.7	casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 
1PE.5.8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 
1PE.5.9	whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. 
1PE.5.10	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle 
1PE.5.11	To him 
1PE.5.13	 The 
1PE.5.14	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity.
1PE.5.14	Peace 
2PE.1.1	Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
2PE.1.1	To them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
2PE.1.2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.
2PE.1.3	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that 
2PE.1.4	whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. 
2PE.1.5	And besides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; 
2PE.1.6	and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; 
2PE.1.7	and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity. 
2PE.1.8	For if these things be in you, and abound, they make 
2PE.1.9	But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. 
2PE.1.10	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: 
2PE.1.11	for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.12	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know 
2PE.1.13	Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting 
2PE.1.14	knowing that shortly I must put off 
2PE.1.15	Moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
2PE.1.16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 
2PE.1.17	 For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 
2PE.1.18	And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. 
2PE.1.19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: 
2PE.1.20	knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation. 
2PE.1.21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake 
2PE.2.1	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. 
2PE.2.2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. 
2PE.2.3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.
2PE.2.4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast 
2PE.2.5	 and spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth 
2PE.2.6	 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomor´rah into ashes condemned 
2PE.2.7	 and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: 
2PE.2.8	(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed 
2PE.2.9	the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: 
2PE.2.10	but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.
2PE.2.10	Presumptuous 
2PE.2.11	Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. 
2PE.2.12	But these, as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; 
2PE.2.13	and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, 
2PE.2.14	having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: a heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: 
2PE.2.15	 which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Ba´laam 
2PE.2.16	but was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbade the madness of the prophet.
2PE.2.17	These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. 
2PE.2.18	For when they speak great swelling 
2PE.2.19	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. 
2PE.2.20	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. 
2PE.2.21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known 
2PE.2.22	 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog 
2PE.3.1	This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in 
2PE.3.2	that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles
2PE.3.3	 knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, 
2PE.3.4	and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as 
2PE.3.5	 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: 
2PE.3.6	 whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: 
2PE.3.7	but the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 
2PE.3.10	 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
2PE.3.12	looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? 
2PE.3.13	 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
2PE.3.14	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. 
2PE.3.15	And account 
2PE.3.16	as also in all 
2PE.3.17	Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know 
2PE.3.18	But grow in grace, and 
1JN.1.2	 (for the life was manifested, and we have seen 
1JN.1.3	that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship 
1JN.1.4	And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
1JN.1.5	This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 
1JN.1.6	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: 
1JN.1.7	but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
1JN.1.8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us 
1JN.1.10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
1JN.2.1	My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 
1JN.2.2	and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for 
1JN.2.3	And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 
1JN.2.4	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
1JN.2.5	But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 
1JN.2.6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
1JN.2.7	Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. 
1JN.2.8	 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. 
1JN.2.9	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. 
1JN.2.10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. 
1JN.2.11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.
1JN.2.12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. 
1JN.2.13	I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him 
1JN.2.14	I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him 
1JN.2.15	Love not the world, neither the things 
1JN.2.16	For all that 
1JN.2.17	And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
1JN.2.18	Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. 
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would 
1JN.2.20	But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 
1JN.2.21	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 
1JN.2.22	Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. 
1JN.2.23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: 
1JN.2.24	Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. 
1JN.2.25	And this is the promise that he hath promised us, 
1JN.2.26	These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. 
1JN.2.27	But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
1JN.2.28	And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 
1JN.2.29	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.
1JN.3.2	Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 
1JN.3.3	And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
1JN.3.4	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. 
1JN.3.5	 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. 
1JN.3.6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 
1JN.3.7	Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 
1JN.3.8	He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 
1JN.3.9	Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 
1JN.3.10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
1JN.3.12	 Not as Cain, 
1JN.3.13	Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 
1JN.3.14	 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not 
1JN.3.15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 
1JN.3.16	Hereby perceive we the love 
1JN.3.17	But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels 
1JN.3.18	My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
1JN.3.19	And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. 
1JN.3.20	For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 
1JN.3.21	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, 
1JN.3.22	And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 
1JN.3.23	 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 
1JN.3.24	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
1JN.4.1	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 
1JN.4.2	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 
1JN.4.3	and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that 
1JN.4.4	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 
1JN.4.5	They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 
1JN.4.6	We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
1JN.4.7	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 
1JN.4.8	He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love. 
1JN.4.9	In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 
1JN.4.10	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son 
1JN.4.11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 
1JN.4.12	 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
1JN.4.13	Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 
1JN.4.14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son 
1JN.4.15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. 
1JN.4.16	And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. 
1JN.4.17	Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. 
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. 
1JN.4.19	We love him, because he first loved us. 
1JN.4.20	If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? 
1JN.4.21	And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
1JN.5.1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. 
1JN.5.2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. 
1JN.5.3	 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. 
1JN.5.4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, 
1JN.5.5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
1JN.5.6	This is he that came by water and blood, 
1JN.5.7	For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. 
1JN.5.8	And there are three that bear witness in earth,
1JN.5.9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. 
1JN.5.10	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. 
1JN.5.11	 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
1JN.5.12	He that hath the Son hath life; 
1JN.5.13	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
1JN.5.14	And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: 
1JN.5.15	and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. 
1JN.5.16	If any man see his brother sin a sin 
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
1JN.5.18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself,
1JN.5.20	And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, 
1JN.5.21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
2JN.1.1	The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; 
2JN.1.2	for the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.
2JN.1.3	Grace be with you, mercy, 
2JN.1.4	I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. 
2JN.1.5	 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. 
2JN.1.6	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. 
2JN.1.7	For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. 
2JN.1.8	Look to yourselves, that we
2JN.1.9	Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. 
2JN.1.10	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into 
2JN.1.11	for he that biddeth him God-speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
2JN.1.12	Having many things to write unto you, I would not 
2JN.1.13	The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
3JN.1.2	Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 
3JN.1.3	For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. 
3JN.1.4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
3JN.1.5	Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; 
3JN.1.6	which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: 
3JN.1.7	because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. 
3JN.1.8	We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow helpers to the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote unto the church: but Diot´re-phes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. 
3JN.1.10	Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth 
3JN.1.11	Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. 
3JN.1.12	Deme´tri-us hath good report of all 
3JN.1.13	I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee: 
3JN.1.14	but I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.
3JN.1.14	Peace 
JUD.1.1	To them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, 
JUD.1.2	Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
JUD.1.3	Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort 
JUD.1.4	For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and
JUD.1.6	And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. 
JUD.1.7	 Even as Sodom and Gomor´rah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
JUD.1.8	Likewise also these 
JUD.1.9	 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. 
JUD.1.10	But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves. 
JUD.1.11	 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Ba´laam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah. 
JUD.1.12	These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds 
JUD.1.13	raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
JUD.1.15	to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard 
JUD.1.16	These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling 
JUD.1.17	But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
JUD.1.18	 how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. 
JUD.1.19	These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. 
JUD.1.20	But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, 
JUD.1.21	keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. 
JUD.1.22	And of some have compassion, making a difference:
JUD.1.23	and others save with fear, pulling 
JUD.1.24	Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present 
JUD.1.25	to the only wise God our Saviour, 
REV.1.1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified 
REV.1.2	who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. 
REV.1.3	Blessed 
REV.1.4	Grace 
REV.1.5	 and from Jesus Christ, 
REV.1.5	Unto him that loved us, and washed
REV.1.6	 and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him 
REV.1.7	 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they 
REV.1.9	I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
REV.1.10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 
REV.1.11	saying, I am Alpha and Ome´ga, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send 
REV.1.12	And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 
REV.1.13	 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks 
REV.1.14	 His head and 
REV.1.15	 and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 
REV.1.16	And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance 
REV.1.18	 he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell
REV.1.19	Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; 
REV.1.20	the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.
REV.2.1	Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.
REV.2.2	I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: 
REV.2.3	and hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast labored, and hast not fainted. 
REV.2.4	Nevertheless I have 
REV.2.5	Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. 
REV.2.6	But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicola´itans, which I also hate. 
REV.2.7	 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
REV.2.9	I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and 
REV.2.10	Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast 
REV.2.11	 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
REV.2.12	And to the angel of the church in Per´gamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges.
REV.2.13	I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, 
REV.2.14	 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Ba´laam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. 
REV.2.15	So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicola´itans, which thing I hate.
REV.2.16	Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. 
REV.2.17	 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth 
REV.2.18	And unto the angel of the church in Thy-ati´ra write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet 
REV.2.19	I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last 
REV.2.20	 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jez´ebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. 
REV.2.21	And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. 
REV.2.22	Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. 
REV.2.23	 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. 
REV.2.24	But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thy-ati´ra, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. 
REV.2.25	But that which ye have 
REV.2.26	 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: 
REV.2.27	and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. 
REV.2.28	And I will give him the morning star. 
REV.2.29	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
REV.3.1	And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars.
REV.3.1	I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. 
REV.3.2	Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. 
REV.3.3	 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. 
REV.3.4	Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy. 
REV.3.5	 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. 
REV.3.6	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
REV.3.8	I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. 
REV.3.9	 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. 
REV.3.10	Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. 
REV.3.11	Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. 
REV.3.12	 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, 
REV.3.13	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
REV.3.15	I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. 
REV.3.16	So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. 
REV.3.17	Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: 
REV.3.18	I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and 
REV.3.19	 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. 
REV.3.20	Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. 
REV.3.21	To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. 
REV.3.22	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
REV.4.1	After this I looked, and, behold, a door 
REV.4.2	 And immediately I was in the Spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and 
REV.4.3	And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and 
REV.4.4	And round about the throne 
REV.4.5	 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and 
REV.4.6	And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, 
REV.4.7	And the first beast 
REV.4.8	 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about 
REV.4.8	Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
REV.4.8	which was, and is, and is to come.
REV.4.9	And when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, 
REV.4.10	the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
REV.4.11	Thou art worthy, O Lord,
REV.4.11	to receive glory and honor and power:
REV.4.11	for thou hast created all things,
REV.4.11	and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
REV.5.2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? 
REV.5.3	And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. 
REV.5.4	And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. 
REV.5.5	 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
REV.5.7	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. 
REV.5.8	 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four 
REV.5.9	And they sung a new song, saying,
REV.5.9	Thou art worthy to take the book,
REV.5.9	and to open the seals thereof:
REV.5.9	for thou wast slain,
REV.5.9	and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood
REV.5.9	out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
REV.5.10	and we
REV.5.12	saying with a loud voice,
REV.5.12	Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.
REV.5.13	And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying,
REV.5.13	Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, 
REV.5.14	And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four 
REV.6.1	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
REV.6.2	 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
REV.6.3	And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.
REV.6.4	 And there went out another horse 
REV.6.6	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and 
REV.6.7	And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
REV.6.8	 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell
REV.6.9	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 
REV.6.10	and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 
REV.6.11	And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they 
REV.6.13	 and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. 
REV.6.14	 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. 
REV.6.15	 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; 
REV.6.16	 and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: 
REV.6.17	 for the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
REV.7.2	And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 
REV.7.3	 saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. 
REV.7.4	And I heard the number of them which were sealed: 
REV.7.5	Of the tribe of Judah 
REV.7.5	Of the tribe of Reuben 
REV.7.5	Of the tribe of Gad 
REV.7.6	Of the tribe of Asher 
REV.7.6	Of the tribe of Naph´tali 
REV.7.6	Of the tribe of Manas´seh 
REV.7.7	Of the tribe of Simeon 
REV.7.7	Of the tribe of Levi 
REV.7.7	Of the tribe of Is´sachar 
REV.7.8	Of the tribe of Zeb´ulun 
REV.7.8	Of the tribe of Joseph 
REV.7.8	Of the tribe of Benjamin 
REV.7.9	After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; 
REV.7.10	and cried with a loud voice, saying,
REV.7.10	Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
REV.7.11	And all the angels stood round about the throne, and 
REV.7.12	saying,
REV.7.12	Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, 
REV.7.13	And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? 
REV.7.14	 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
REV.7.15	Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. 
REV.7.16	 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. 
REV.7.17	 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
REV.8.1	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. 
REV.8.2	And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. 
REV.8.3	 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer 
REV.8.4	And the smoke of the incense, 
REV.8.5	 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast 
REV.8.6	And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
REV.8.8	And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; 
REV.8.9	and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.11	and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
REV.8.13	And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!
REV.9.1	And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. 
REV.9.2	And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. 
REV.9.3	 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 
REV.9.4	 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. 
REV.9.5	And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment 
REV.9.6	 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
REV.9.8	 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as 
REV.9.9	 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings 
REV.9.10	And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power 
REV.9.11	And they had a king over them, 
REV.9.12	One woe is past; 
REV.9.14	saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphra´tes. 
REV.9.15	And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. 
REV.9.16	And the number of the army of the horsemen 
REV.9.17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses 
REV.9.18	By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. 
REV.9.19	For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails 
REV.9.21	neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
REV.10.1	And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow 
REV.10.2	and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and 
REV.10.3	and cried with a loud voice, as 
REV.10.4	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. 
REV.10.5	 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, 
REV.10.6	and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:
REV.10.7	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
REV.10.9	And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take 
REV.10.10	And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. 
REV.10.11	And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
REV.11.2	 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty 
REV.11.3	And I will give 
REV.11.5	And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. 
REV.11.6	 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. 
REV.11.7	 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. 
REV.11.8	 And their dead bodies 
REV.11.9	And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. 
REV.11.10	And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. 
REV.11.11	 And after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. 
REV.11.12	 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. 
REV.11.13	 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	The second woe is past; 
REV.11.15	The kingdoms of this world are become 
REV.11.16	And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, 
REV.11.17	saying,
REV.11.17	We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. 
REV.11.18	 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.
REV.12.2	 and she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. 
REV.12.3	 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. 
REV.12.4	 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. 
REV.12.5	 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and 
REV.12.6	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred 
REV.12.8	and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 
REV.12.9	 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 
REV.12.10	 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven,
REV.12.10	Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. 
REV.12.11	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. 
REV.12.12	Therefore rejoice, 
REV.12.13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man 
REV.12.14	 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. 
REV.12.15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. 
REV.12.16	And the earth helped the woman; and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. 
REV.12.17	And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
REV.13.2	 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as 
REV.13.3	And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. 
REV.13.4	And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who 
REV.13.6	And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. 
REV.13.7	 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. 
REV.13.8	 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. 
REV.13.9	If any man have an ear, let him hear. 
REV.13.10	 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
REV.13.11	And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 
REV.13.12	And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 
REV.13.13	And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, 
REV.13.14	and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by 
REV.13.15	And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. 
REV.13.16	And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 
REV.13.17	and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 
REV.13.18	Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number 
REV.14.2	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: 
REV.14.3	and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred 
REV.14.4	These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, 
REV.14.5	 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.
REV.14.6	And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 
REV.14.7	saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
REV.14.9	And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive 
REV.14.10	 the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 
REV.14.11	 and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
REV.14.12	Here is the patience of the saints: here 
REV.14.13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed 
REV.14.15	 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. 
REV.14.16	And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
REV.14.17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. 
REV.14.19	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast 
REV.14.20	 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand 
REV.15.1	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.
REV.15.2	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, 
REV.15.3	 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,
REV.15.3	Great and marvelous 
REV.15.3	Lord God Almighty;
REV.15.3	just and true 
REV.15.3	thou King of saints.
REV.15.4	For 
REV.15.4	for all nations shall come and worship before thee;
REV.15.4	for thy judgments are made manifest.
REV.15.6	and the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. 
REV.15.7	And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 
REV.15.8	 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
REV.16.1	And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
REV.16.3	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead 
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be,
REV.16.6	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. 
REV.16.7	And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous 
REV.16.8	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. 
REV.16.9	And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.
REV.16.11	and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
REV.16.13	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs 
REV.16.14	For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, 
REV.16.15	 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed 
REV.16.16	 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armaged´don.
REV.16.17	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. 
REV.16.18	 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, 
REV.16.19	 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. 
REV.16.20	 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. 
REV.16.21	 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, 
REV.17.2	 with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. 
REV.17.3	 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 
REV.17.4	 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: 
REV.17.5	and upon her forehead 
REV.17.6	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.
REV.17.6	And when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. 
REV.17.7	And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns. 
REV.17.8	 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. 
REV.17.9	And here 
REV.17.10	And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, 
REV.17.11	And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. 
REV.17.12	 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. 
REV.17.13	These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. 
REV.17.14	These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him 
REV.17.15	And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. 
REV.17.16	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. 
REV.17.17	For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. 
REV.17.18	And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
REV.18.1	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. 
REV.18.2	 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. 
REV.18.3	 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. 
REV.18.4	 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. 
REV.18.5	 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. 
REV.18.6	 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double. 
REV.18.7	 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. 
REV.18.8	Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong 
REV.18.10	standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
REV.18.12	the merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble, 
REV.18.13	and cinnamon, and odors, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men. 
REV.18.14	And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all. 
REV.18.15	The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, 
REV.18.16	and saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! 
REV.18.17	For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, 
REV.18.18	and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What 
REV.18.19	And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate. 
REV.18.20	 Rejoice over her, 
REV.18.23	and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. 
REV.18.24	 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.
REV.19.1	And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying,
REV.19.1	Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God: 
REV.19.2	 for true and righteous 
REV.19.4	And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia. 
REV.19.5	 And a voice came out of the throne, saying,
REV.19.5	Praise our God, all ye his servants,
REV.19.5	and ye that fear him, both small and great.
REV.19.6	Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. 
REV.19.7	Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. 
REV.19.8	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
REV.19.10	And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See 
REV.19.12	 His eyes 
REV.19.13	And he 
REV.19.14	And the armies 
REV.19.15	 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. 
REV.19.16	And he hath on 
REV.19.18	that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all 
REV.19.19	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. 
REV.19.20	 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. 
REV.19.21	And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which 
REV.20.1	And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 
REV.20.2	 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 
REV.20.3	and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
REV.20.5	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This 
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy 
REV.20.7	And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, 
REV.20.8	 and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom 
REV.20.9	And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. 
REV.20.10	And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet 
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is 
REV.20.13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell
REV.20.14	And death and hell
REV.20.15	And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
REV.21.2	 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 
REV.21.3	 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God 
REV.21.4	 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
REV.21.5	And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. 
REV.21.6	 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Ome´ga, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. 
REV.21.7	 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. 
REV.21.8	But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
REV.21.9	And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. 
REV.21.10	 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, 
REV.21.11	having the glory of God: and her light 
REV.21.12	 and had a wall great and high, 
REV.21.13	on the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. 
REV.21.14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
REV.21.16	And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. 
REV.21.17	And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred 
REV.21.18	 And the building of the wall of it was 
REV.21.19	And the foundations of the wall of the city 
REV.21.20	the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. 
REV.21.21	And the twelve gates 
REV.21.22	And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. 
REV.21.23	 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb 
REV.21.24	And the nations of them which are saved
REV.21.25	 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there. 
REV.21.26	And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it. 
REV.21.27	 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither 
REV.22.2	 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, 
REV.22.3	 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: 
REV.22.4	and they shall see his face; and his name 
REV.22.5	 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
REV.22.6	And he said unto me, These sayings 
REV.22.7	Behold, I come quickly.
REV.22.7	Blessed 
REV.22.8	And I John saw these things, and heard 
REV.22.9	Then saith he unto me, See 
REV.22.10	And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand. 
REV.22.11	 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
REV.22.13	 I am Alpha and Ome´ga, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
REV.22.15	For without 
REV.22.19	and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book
REV.22.20	He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
REV.22.21	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
