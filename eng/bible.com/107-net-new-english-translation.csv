GEN.1.8	 God called the expanse “sky.”
GEN.1.9	 God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place
GEN.1.10	 God called the dry ground “land”
GEN.1.11	 God said, “Let the land produce vegetation:
GEN.1.12	 The land produced vegetation – plants yielding seeds according to their kinds, and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.13	 There was evening, and there was morning, a third day.
GEN.1.14	 God said, “Let there be lights
GEN.1.15	 and let them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.” It was so. 
GEN.1.16	 God made two great lights
GEN.1.17	 God placed the lights
GEN.1.18	 to preside over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness.
GEN.1.19	 There was evening, and there was morning, a fourth day.
GEN.1.20	 God said, “Let the water swarm with swarms
GEN.1.21	 God created the great sea creatures
GEN.1.22	 God blessed them
GEN.1.23	 There was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day. 
GEN.1.24	 God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: cattle, creeping things, and wild animals, each according to its kind.”
GEN.1.25	 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the cattle according to their kinds, and all the creatures that creep along the ground according to their kinds. God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.26	 Then God said, “Let us make
GEN.1.27	 God created humankind
GEN.1.27	in the image of God he created them,

GEN.2.17	 but
GEN.2.18	 The 
GEN.2.19	 The 
GEN.2.20	 So the man named all the animals, the birds of the air, and the living creatures of the field, but for Adam

GEN.3.7	 Then the eyes of both of them opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.

GEN.3.9	 But the 
GEN.3.10	 The man replied,

GEN.3.20	 The man

GEN.4.5	 but with Cain and his offering he was not pleased.
GEN.4.6	 Then the 
GEN.4.7	 Is it not true
GEN.4.8	 Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.”
GEN.4.9	 Then the 
GEN.4.10	 But the 
GEN.4.11	 So now, you are banished

GEN.4.13	 Then Cain said to the 
GEN.4.14	 Look! You are driving me off the land
GEN.4.15	 But the 
GEN.4.16	 So Cain went out from the presence of the 
GEN.4.17	 Cain had marital relations

GEN.4.20	 Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the first
GEN.4.21	 The name of his brother was Jubal; he was the first of all who play the harp and the flute. 
GEN.4.22	 Now Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain, who heated metal and shaped
GEN.4.23	 Lamech said to his wives, 
GEN.4.23	“Adah and Zillah! Listen to me! 
GEN.4.23	You wives of Lamech, hear my words! 
GEN.4.23	I have killed a man for wounding me, 
GEN.4.23	a young man
GEN.4.24	 If Cain is to be avenged seven times as much, 
GEN.4.24	then Lamech seventy-seven times!”
GEN.4.25	 And Adam had marital relations
GEN.4.26	 And a son was also born to Seth, whom he named Enosh. At that time people
GEN.5.1	 This is the record
GEN.5.1	When God created humankind,
GEN.5.2	 He created them male and female; when they were created, he blessed them and named them “humankind.”

GEN.5.32	 After Noah was 500 years old, he
GEN.6.1	 When humankind
GEN.6.2	 the sons of God
GEN.6.3	 So the 
GEN.6.4	 The Nephilim
GEN.6.5	 But the 
GEN.6.6	 The 
GEN.6.7	 So the 
GEN.6.8	 But
GEN.6.9	 This is the account of Noah.
GEN.6.9	Noah was a godly man; he was blameless
GEN.6.9	among his contemporaries.
GEN.6.10	 Noah had
GEN.6.11	 The earth was ruined
GEN.6.12	 God saw the earth, and indeed
GEN.6.13	 So God said
GEN.6.14	 Make
GEN.6.15	 This is how you should make it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
GEN.6.16	 Make a roof for the ark and finish it, leaving 18 inches
GEN.6.17	 I am about to bring
GEN.6.18	 but I will confirm
GEN.6.19	 You must bring into the ark two of every kind of living creature from all flesh,
GEN.6.20	 Of the birds after their kinds, and of the cattle after their kinds, and of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every kind will come to you so you can keep them alive.
GEN.6.21	 And you must take
GEN.6.22	 And Noah did all
GEN.7.1	 The 
GEN.7.2	 You must take with you seven
GEN.7.3	 and also seven
GEN.7.4	 For in seven days
GEN.7.5	 And Noah did all
GEN.7.6	 Noah
GEN.7.7	 Noah entered the ark along with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives because
GEN.7.8	 Pairs
GEN.7.9	 male and female, came into the ark to Noah,
GEN.7.10	 And after seven days the floodwaters engulfed the earth.
GEN.7.11	 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month – on that day all the fountains of the great deep
GEN.7.12	 And the rain fell
GEN.7.13	 On that very day Noah entered the ark, accompanied by his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, along with his wife and his sons’ three wives.
GEN.7.14	 They entered,
GEN.7.15	 Pairs
GEN.7.16	 Those that entered were male and female,
GEN.7.17	 The flood engulfed the earth for forty days. As the waters increased, they lifted the ark and raised it above the earth. 
GEN.7.18	 The waters completely overwhelmed
GEN.7.19	 The waters completely inundated
GEN.7.20	 The waters rose more than twenty feet
GEN.7.21	 And all living things
GEN.7.22	 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life
GEN.7.23	 So the 
GEN.7.24	 The waters prevailed over
GEN.8.1	 But God remembered
GEN.8.2	 The fountains of the deep and the floodgates of heaven were closed,
GEN.8.3	 The waters kept receding steadily
GEN.8.4	 On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on one of the mountains of Ararat.
GEN.8.5	 The waters kept on receding
GEN.8.6	 At the end of forty days,
GEN.8.7	 and sent out a raven; it kept flying
GEN.8.8	 Then Noah
GEN.8.9	 The dove could not find a resting place for its feet because water still covered
GEN.8.10	 He waited seven more days and then sent out the dove again from the ark. 
GEN.8.11	 When
GEN.8.12	 He waited another seven days and sent the dove out again,
GEN.8.13	 In Noah’s six hundred and first year,
GEN.8.14	 And by the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth
GEN.8.15	 Then God spoke to Noah and said, 
GEN.8.16	 “Come out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you. 
GEN.8.17	 Bring out with you all the living creatures that are with you. Bring out
GEN.8.18	 Noah went out along with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives. 
GEN.8.19	 Every living creature, every creeping thing, every bird, and everything that moves on the earth went out of the ark in their groups. 
GEN.8.20	 Noah built an altar to the 
GEN.8.21	 And the 
GEN.8.22	 “While the earth continues to exist,
GEN.8.22	planting time
GEN.8.22	cold and heat, 
GEN.8.22	summer and winter, 
GEN.8.22	and day and night will not cease.”
GEN.9.1	 Then God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. 
GEN.9.2	 Every living creature of the earth and every bird of the sky will be terrified of you.
GEN.9.3	 You may eat any moving thing that lives.
GEN.9.4	 But
GEN.9.5	 For your lifeblood
GEN.9.6	 “Whoever sheds human blood,
GEN.9.6	by other humans
GEN.9.6	must his blood be shed; 
GEN.9.6	for in God’s image
GEN.9.6	God
GEN.9.7	 But as for you,
GEN.9.8	 God said to Noah and his sons,
GEN.9.9	 “Look! I now confirm
GEN.9.10	 and with every living creature that is with you, including the birds, the domestic animals, and every living creature of the earth with you, all those that came out of the ark with you – every living creature of the earth.
GEN.9.11	 I confirm
GEN.9.12	 And God said, “This is the guarantee
GEN.9.13	 I will place
GEN.9.14	 Whenever
GEN.9.15	 then I will remember my covenant with you
GEN.9.16	 When the rainbow is in the clouds, I will notice it and remember
GEN.9.17	 So God said to Noah, “This is the guarantee of the covenant that I am confirming between me and all living things
GEN.9.18	 The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Now Ham was the father of Canaan.)
GEN.9.19	 These were the sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was populated.
GEN.9.20	 Noah, a man of the soil,
GEN.9.21	 When he drank some of the wine, he got drunk and uncovered himself
GEN.9.22	 Ham, the father of Canaan,
GEN.9.23	 Shem and Japheth took the garment
GEN.9.24	 When Noah awoke from his drunken stupor
GEN.9.25	 So he said,
GEN.9.25	“Cursed
GEN.9.25	The lowest of slaves
GEN.9.25	he will be to his brothers.”
GEN.9.26	 He also said,
GEN.9.26	“Worthy of praise is
GEN.9.26	May Canaan be the slave of Shem!
GEN.9.27	 May God enlarge Japheth’s territory and numbers!
GEN.9.27	May he live
GEN.9.27	and may Canaan be his slave!”
GEN.9.28	 After the flood Noah lived 350 years. 
GEN.9.29	 The entire lifetime of Noah was 950 years, and then he died.
GEN.10.1	 This is the account
GEN.10.2	 The sons of Japheth
GEN.10.3	 The sons of Gomer were
GEN.10.4	 The sons of Javan were Elishah,
GEN.10.5	 From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to its language, according to their families, by their nations.
GEN.10.6	 The sons of Ham were Cush,
GEN.10.7	 The sons of Cush were Seba,
GEN.10.8	 Cush was the father of
GEN.10.9	 He was a mighty hunter
GEN.10.10	 The primary regions
GEN.10.11	 From that land he went
GEN.10.12	 and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city Calah.
GEN.10.13	 Mizraim
GEN.10.14	 Pathrusites,
GEN.10.15	 Canaan was the father of
GEN.10.16	 the Jebusites,
GEN.10.17	 Hivites,
GEN.10.18	 Arvadites,
GEN.10.19	 and the borders of Canaan extended
GEN.10.20	 These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, and by their nations.
GEN.10.21	 And sons were also born
GEN.10.22	 The sons of Shem were Elam,
GEN.10.23	 The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
GEN.10.24	 Arphaxad was the father of

GEN.10.26	 Joktan was the father of
GEN.10.27	 Hadoram, Uzal,
GEN.10.28	 Obal,
GEN.10.29	 Ophir,
GEN.10.30	 Their dwelling place was from Mesha all the way to
GEN.10.31	 These are the sons of Shem according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, and according to their nations.
GEN.10.32	 These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, by their nations, and from these the nations spread
GEN.11.1	 The whole earth
GEN.11.2	 When the people
GEN.11.3	 Then they said to one another,
GEN.11.4	 Then they said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens
GEN.11.5	 But the 
GEN.11.6	 And the 
GEN.11.7	 Come, let’s go down and confuse
GEN.11.8	 So the 
GEN.11.9	 That is why its name was called
GEN.11.10	 This is the account of Shem.
GEN.11.10	Shem was 100 old when he became the father of Arphaxad, two years after the flood. 
GEN.11.11	 And after becoming the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other
GEN.11.12	 When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah. 
GEN.11.13	 And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other

GEN.11.17	 And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.18	 When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu. 
GEN.11.19	 And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	 When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug. 
GEN.11.21	 And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	 When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor. 
GEN.11.23	 And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.24	 When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah. 
GEN.11.25	 And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	 When Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	 This is the account of Terah.
GEN.11.27	Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot. 
GEN.11.28	 Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans,
GEN.11.29	 And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai,
GEN.11.30	 But Sarai was barren; she had no children. 
GEN.11.31	 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (the son of Haran), and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and with them he set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. When they came to Haran, they settled there. 
GEN.11.32	 The lifetime
GEN.12.1	 Now the 
GEN.12.1	“Go out
GEN.12.1	to the land that I will show you.
GEN.12.2	 Then I will make you
GEN.12.2	and I will make your name great,
GEN.12.2	so that you will exemplify divine blessing.
GEN.12.3	 I will bless those who bless you,
GEN.12.3	but the one who treats you lightly
GEN.12.3	and all the families of the earth will bless one another
GEN.12.4	 So Abram left,
GEN.12.5	 And Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew
GEN.12.6	 Abram traveled through the land as far as the oak tree
GEN.12.7	 The 
GEN.12.8	 Then he moved from there to the hill country east of Bethel
GEN.12.9	 Abram continually journeyed by stages
GEN.12.10	 There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt
GEN.12.11	 As he approached
GEN.12.12	 When the Egyptians see you they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will keep you alive.
GEN.12.13	 So tell them
GEN.12.14	 When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. 
GEN.12.15	 When Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. So Abram’s wife
GEN.12.16	 and he did treat Abram well
GEN.12.17	 But the 
GEN.12.18	 So Pharaoh summoned Abram and said, “What is this
GEN.12.19	 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her
GEN.12.20	 Pharaoh gave his men orders about Abram,
GEN.13.1	 So Abram went up from Egypt into the Negev.
GEN.13.2	 (Now Abram was very wealthy
GEN.13.3	 And he journeyed from place to place
GEN.13.4	 This was the place where he had first built the altar,
GEN.13.5	 Now Lot, who was traveling
GEN.13.6	 But the land could
GEN.13.7	 So there were quarrels
GEN.13.8	 Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no quarreling between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are close relatives.
GEN.13.9	 Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself now from me. If you go
GEN.13.10	 Lot looked up and saw
GEN.13.11	 Lot chose for himself the whole region of the Jordan and traveled
GEN.13.11	So the relatives separated from each other.
GEN.13.12	 Abram settled in the land of Canaan, but Lot settled among the cities of the Jordan plain
GEN.13.13	 (Now
GEN.13.14	 After Lot had departed, the 
GEN.13.15	 I will give all the land that you see to you and your descendants
GEN.13.16	 And I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone is able to count the dust of the earth, then your descendants also can be counted.
GEN.13.17	 Get up and
GEN.13.18	 So Abram moved his tents and went to live
GEN.14.1	 At that time
GEN.14.2	 went to war
GEN.14.3	 These last five kings
GEN.14.4	 For twelve years
GEN.14.5	 In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings who were his allies came and defeated
GEN.14.6	 and the Horites in their hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran, which is near the desert.
GEN.14.7	 Then they attacked En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh) again,
GEN.14.8	 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out and prepared for battle. In the Valley of Siddim they met
GEN.14.9	 Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of nations,
GEN.14.10	 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits.
GEN.14.11	 The four victorious kings
GEN.14.12	 They also took Abram’s nephew
GEN.14.13	 A fugitive
GEN.14.14	 When Abram heard that his nephew
GEN.14.15	 Then, during the night,
GEN.14.16	 He retrieved all the stolen property.
GEN.14.17	 After Abram
GEN.14.18	 Melchizedek king of Salem
GEN.14.19	 He blessed Abram, saying, 
GEN.14.19	“Blessed be Abram by
GEN.14.19	Creator
GEN.14.20	 Worthy of praise is
GEN.14.20	who delivered
GEN.14.20	Abram gave Melchizedek
GEN.14.21	 Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and take the possessions for yourself.” 
GEN.14.22	 But Abram replied to the king of Sodom, “I raise my hand
GEN.14.23	 that I will take nothing
GEN.14.24	 I will take nothing
GEN.15.1	 After these things the word of the 
GEN.15.2	 But Abram said, “O sovereign 
GEN.15.3	 Abram added,
GEN.15.4	 But look,
GEN.15.5	 The 
GEN.15.6	 Abram believed
GEN.15.7	 The 
GEN.15.8	 But
GEN.15.9	 The 
GEN.15.10	 So Abram
GEN.15.11	 When birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	 When the sun went down, Abram fell sound asleep,
GEN.15.13	 Then the 
GEN.15.14	 But I will execute judgment on the nation that they will serve.
GEN.15.15	 But as for you,
GEN.15.16	 In the fourth generation
GEN.15.17	 When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking firepot with a flaming torch
GEN.15.18	 That day the 
GEN.15.19	 the land
GEN.15.20	 Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, 
GEN.15.21	 Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	 Now Sarai,
GEN.16.2	 So Sarai said to Abram, “Since
GEN.16.3	 So after Abram had lived
GEN.16.4	 He had sexual relations with
GEN.16.5	 Then Sarai said to Abram, “You have brought this wrong on me!
GEN.16.6	 Abram said to Sarai, “Since your
GEN.16.7	 The 
GEN.16.8	 He said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” She replied, “I’m running away from
GEN.16.9	 Then the 
GEN.16.10	 I will greatly multiply your descendants,” the 
GEN.16.11	 Then the 
GEN.16.11	“You are now
GEN.16.11	and are about to give birth
GEN.16.11	You are to name him Ishmael,
GEN.16.11	for the 
GEN.16.12	 He will be a wild donkey
GEN.16.12	He will be hostile to everyone,
GEN.16.12	and everyone will be hostile to him.
GEN.16.12	He will live away from
GEN.16.13	 So Hagar named the 
GEN.16.14	 That is why the well was called
GEN.16.15	 So Hagar gave birth to Abram’s son, whom Abram named Ishmael.
GEN.16.16	 (Now
GEN.17.1	 When Abram was 99 years old,
GEN.17.2	 Then I will confirm my covenant
GEN.17.3	 Abram bowed down with his face to the ground,
GEN.17.4	 “As for me,
GEN.17.5	 No longer will your name be
GEN.17.6	 I will make you
GEN.17.7	 I will confirm
GEN.17.8	 I will give the whole land of Canaan – the land where you are now residing
GEN.17.9	 Then God said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep
GEN.17.10	 This is my requirement that you and your descendants after you must keep:
GEN.17.11	 You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskins. This will be a reminder
GEN.17.12	 Throughout your generations every male among you who is eight days old
GEN.17.13	 They must indeed be circumcised,
GEN.17.14	 Any uncircumcised male
GEN.17.15	 Then God said to Abraham, “As for your wife, you must no longer call her Sarai;
GEN.17.16	 I will bless her and will give you a son through her. I will bless her and she will become a mother of nations.
GEN.17.17	 Then Abraham bowed down with his face to the ground and laughed
GEN.17.18	 Abraham said to God, “O that
GEN.17.19	 God said, “No, Sarah your wife is going to bear you a son, and you will name him Isaac.
GEN.17.20	 As for Ishmael, I have heard you.
GEN.17.21	 But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.” 
GEN.17.22	 When he finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
GEN.17.23	 Abraham took his son Ishmael and every male in his household (whether born in his house or bought with money)
GEN.17.24	 Now Abraham was 99 years old
GEN.17.25	 his son Ishmael was thirteen years old
GEN.17.26	 Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised on the very same day. 
GEN.17.27	 All the men of his household, whether born in his household or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	 The 
GEN.18.2	 Abraham
GEN.18.3	 He said, “My lord,
GEN.18.4	 Let a little water be brought so that
GEN.18.5	 And let me get
GEN.18.6	 So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick! Take
GEN.18.7	 Then Abraham ran to the herd and chose a fine, tender calf, and gave it to a servant,
GEN.18.8	 Abraham
GEN.18.9	 Then they asked him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” He replied, “There,
GEN.18.10	 One of them
GEN.18.11	 Abraham and Sarah were old and advancing in years;
GEN.18.12	 So Sarah laughed to herself, thinking,
GEN.18.13	 The 
GEN.18.14	 Is anything impossible
GEN.18.15	 Then Sarah lied, saying, “I did not laugh,” because she was afraid. But the 
GEN.18.16	 When the men got up to leave,
GEN.18.17	 Then the 
GEN.18.18	 After all, Abraham
GEN.18.19	 I have chosen him
GEN.18.20	 So the 
GEN.18.21	 that I must go down
GEN.18.22	 The two men turned
GEN.18.23	 Abraham approached and said, “Will you sweep away the godly along with the wicked? 
GEN.18.24	 What if there are fifty godly people in the city? Will you really wipe it out and not spare
GEN.18.25	 Far be it from you to do such a thing – to kill the godly with the wicked, treating the godly and the wicked alike! Far be it from you! Will not the judge
GEN.18.26	 So the 
GEN.18.27	 Then Abraham asked, “Since I have undertaken to speak to the Lord
GEN.18.28	 what if there are five less than the fifty godly people? Will you destroy
GEN.18.29	 Abraham
GEN.18.30	 Then Abraham
GEN.18.31	 Abraham
GEN.18.32	 Finally Abraham
GEN.18.33	 The 
GEN.19.1	 The two angels came to Sodom in the evening while
GEN.19.2	 He said, “Here, my lords, please turn aside to your servant’s house. Stay the night
GEN.19.3	 But he urged
GEN.19.4	 Before they could lie down to sleep,
GEN.19.5	 They shouted to Lot,
GEN.19.6	 Lot went outside to them, shutting the door behind him. 
GEN.19.7	 He said, “No, my brothers! Don’t act so wickedly!
GEN.19.8	 Look, I have two daughters who have never had sexual relations with
GEN.19.9	 “Out of our way!”
GEN.19.10	 So the men inside
GEN.19.11	 Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, from the youngest to the oldest,
GEN.19.12	 Then the two visitors
GEN.19.13	 because we are about to destroy
GEN.19.14	 Then Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law who were going to marry his daughters.
GEN.19.15	 At dawn
GEN.19.16	 When Lot
GEN.19.17	 When they had brought them outside, they
GEN.19.18	 But Lot said to them, “No, please, Lord!
GEN.19.19	 Your
GEN.19.20	 Look, this town
GEN.19.21	 “Very well,” he replied,
GEN.19.22	 Run there quickly,
GEN.19.23	 The sun had just risen
GEN.19.24	 Then the 
GEN.19.25	 So he overthrew those cities and all that region,
GEN.19.26	 But Lot’s
GEN.19.27	 Abraham got up early in the morning and went
GEN.19.28	 He looked out toward
GEN.19.29	 So when God destroyed
GEN.19.30	 Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and settled in the mountains because he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters. 
GEN.19.31	 Later the older daughter said
GEN.19.32	 Come, let’s make our father drunk with wine
GEN.19.33	 So that night they made their father drunk with wine,
GEN.19.34	 So in the morning the older daughter
GEN.19.35	 So they made their father drunk
GEN.19.36	 In this way both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. 
GEN.19.37	 The older daughter
GEN.19.38	 The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi.
GEN.20.1	 Abraham journeyed from there to the Negev
GEN.20.2	 Abraham said about his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her.
GEN.20.3	 But God appeared
GEN.20.4	 Now Abimelech had not gone near her. He said, “Lord,
GEN.20.5	 Did Abraham
GEN.20.6	 Then in the dream God replied to him, “Yes, I know that you have done this with a clear conscience.
GEN.20.7	 But now give back the man’s wife. Indeed
GEN.20.8	 Early in the morning
GEN.20.9	 Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? What sin did I commit against you that would cause you to bring such great guilt on me and my kingdom?
GEN.20.10	 Then Abimelech asked
GEN.20.11	 Abraham replied, “Because I thought,
GEN.20.12	 What’s more,
GEN.20.13	 When God made me wander
GEN.20.14	 So Abimelech gave
GEN.20.15	 Then Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you; live wherever you please.”
GEN.20.16	 To Sarah he said, “Look, I have given a thousand pieces of silver
GEN.20.17	 Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, as well as his wife and female slaves so that they were able to have children. 
GEN.20.18	 For the 
GEN.21.1	 The 
GEN.21.2	 So Sarah became pregnant
GEN.21.3	 Abraham named his son – whom Sarah bore to him – Isaac.
GEN.21.4	 When his son Isaac was eight days old,
GEN.21.5	 (Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.)
GEN.21.6	 Sarah said, “God has made me laugh.
GEN.21.7	 She went on to say,
GEN.21.8	 The child grew and was weaned. Abraham prepared
GEN.21.9	 But Sarah noticed
GEN.21.10	 So she said to Abraham, “Banish
GEN.21.11	 Sarah’s demand displeased Abraham greatly because Ishmael was his son.
GEN.21.12	 But God said to Abraham, “Do not be upset
GEN.21.13	 But I will also make the son of the slave wife into a great nation, for he is your descendant too.”
GEN.21.14	 Early in the morning Abraham took
GEN.21.15	 When the water in the skin was gone, she shoved
GEN.21.16	 Then she went and sat down by herself across from him at quite a distance, about a bowshot
GEN.21.17	 But God heard the boy’s voice.
GEN.21.18	 Get up! Help the boy up and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.” 
GEN.21.19	 Then God enabled Hagar to see a well of water.
GEN.21.20	 God was with the boy as he grew. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer. 
GEN.21.21	 He lived in the wilderness of Paran.
GEN.21.22	 At that time Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “God is with you
GEN.21.23	 Now swear to me right here in God’s name
GEN.21.24	 Abraham said, “I swear to do this.”
GEN.21.25	 But Abraham lodged a complaint
GEN.21.26	 “I do not know who has done this thing,” Abimelech replied. “Moreover,
GEN.21.27	 Abraham took some sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech. The two of them made a treaty.
GEN.21.28	 Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs apart from the flock by themselves. 
GEN.21.29	 Abimelech asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these
GEN.21.30	 He replied, “You must take these seven ewe lambs from my hand as legal proof
GEN.21.31	 That is why he named that place
GEN.21.32	 So they made a treaty
GEN.21.33	 Abraham
GEN.21.34	 So Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for quite some time.
GEN.22.1	 Some time after these things God tested
GEN.22.2	 God
GEN.22.3	 Early in the morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey.
GEN.22.4	 On the third day Abraham caught sight of
GEN.22.5	 So he
GEN.22.6	 Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac. Then he took the fire and the knife in his hand,
GEN.22.7	 Isaac said to his father Abraham,
GEN.22.8	 “God will provide
GEN.22.9	 When they came to the place God had told him about, Abraham built the altar there
GEN.22.10	 Then Abraham reached out his hand, took the knife, and prepared to slaughter
GEN.22.11	 But the 
GEN.22.12	 “Do not harm the boy!”
GEN.22.13	 Abraham looked up
GEN.22.14	 And Abraham called the name of that place “The 
GEN.22.15	 The 
GEN.22.16	 and said, “‘I solemnly swear by my own name,’
GEN.22.17	 I will indeed bless you,
GEN.22.18	 Because you have obeyed me,
GEN.22.19	 Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set out together
GEN.22.20	 After these things Abraham was told, “Milcah
GEN.22.21	 Uz the firstborn, his brother Buz, Kemuel (the father of Aram),
GEN.22.22	 Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	 (Now
GEN.22.24	 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore him children – Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	 Sarah lived 127 years.
GEN.23.2	 Then she
GEN.23.3	 Then Abraham got up from mourning his dead wife
GEN.23.4	 “I am a temporary settler
GEN.23.5	 The sons of Heth answered Abraham,
GEN.23.6	 “Listen, sir,
GEN.23.7	 Abraham got up and bowed down to the local people,
GEN.23.8	 Then he said to them, “If you agree
GEN.23.9	 if he will sell
GEN.23.10	 (Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth.) Ephron the Hethite
GEN.23.11	 “No, my lord! Hear me out. I sell
GEN.23.12	 Abraham bowed before the local people 
GEN.23.13	 and said to Ephron in their hearing, “Hear me, if you will. I pay
GEN.23.14	 Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 
GEN.23.15	 “Hear me, my lord. The land is worth
GEN.23.16	 So Abraham agreed to Ephron’s price
GEN.23.17	 So Abraham secured
GEN.23.18	 as his property in the presence of the sons of Heth before all who entered the gate of Ephron’s city.
GEN.23.19	 After this Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah next to Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.20	 So Abraham secured the field and the cave that was in it as a burial site
GEN.24.1	 Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years,
GEN.24.2	 Abraham said to his servant, the senior one
GEN.24.3	 so that I may make you solemnly promise
GEN.24.4	 You must go instead to my country and to my relatives
GEN.24.5	 The servant asked him, “What if the woman is not willing to come back with me
GEN.24.6	 “Be careful
GEN.24.7	 “The 
GEN.24.8	 But if the woman is not willing to come back with you,
GEN.24.9	 So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and gave his solemn promise he would carry out his wishes.
GEN.24.10	 Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed with all kinds of gifts from his master at his disposal.
GEN.24.11	 He made the camels kneel down by the well
GEN.24.12	 He prayed, “O 
GEN.24.13	 Here I am, standing by the spring,
GEN.24.14	 I will say to a young woman, ‘Please lower your jar so I may drink.’ May the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac reply, ‘Drink, and I’ll give your camels water too.’
GEN.24.15	 Before he had finished praying, there came Rebekah
GEN.24.16	 Now the young woman was very beautiful. She was a virgin; no man had ever had sexual relations with her.
GEN.24.17	 Abraham’s servant
GEN.24.18	 “Drink, my lord,” she replied, and quickly lowering
GEN.24.19	 When she had done so,
GEN.24.20	 She quickly emptied
GEN.24.21	 Silently the man watched her with interest to determine
GEN.24.22	 After the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka
GEN.24.23	 “Whose daughter are you?” he asked.
GEN.24.24	 She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom Milcah bore to Nahor.
GEN.24.25	 We have plenty of straw and feed,” she added,
GEN.24.26	 The man bowed his head and worshiped the 
GEN.24.27	 saying “Praised be the 
GEN.24.28	 The young woman ran and told her mother’s household all about
GEN.24.29	 (Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban.)
GEN.24.30	 When he saw the bracelets on his sister’s wrists and the nose ring
GEN.24.31	 Laban said to him,
GEN.24.32	 So Abraham’s servant
GEN.24.33	 When food was served,
GEN.24.34	 “I am the servant of Abraham,” he began. 
GEN.24.35	 “The 
GEN.24.36	 My master’s wife Sarah bore a son to him
GEN.24.37	 My master made me swear an oath. He said, ‘You must not acquire a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, 
GEN.24.38	 but you must go to the family of my father and to my relatives to find
GEN.24.39	 But I said to my master, ‘What if the woman does not want to go
GEN.24.40	 He answered, ‘The 
GEN.24.41	 You will be free from your oath
GEN.24.42	 When I came to the spring today, I prayed, ‘O 
GEN.24.43	 Here I am, standing by the spring.
GEN.24.44	 Then she will reply to me, “Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too.” May that woman be the one whom the 
GEN.24.45	 “Before I finished praying in my heart,
GEN.24.46	 She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll give your camels water too.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels water. 
GEN.24.47	 Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘The daughter of Bethuel the son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to Nahor.’
GEN.24.48	 Then I bowed down and worshiped the 
GEN.24.49	 Now, if you will show faithful love to my master, tell me. But if not, tell me as well, so that I may go on my way.”
GEN.24.50	 Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “This is the 
GEN.24.51	 Rebekah stands here before you. Take her and go so that she may become
GEN.24.52	 When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground before the 
GEN.24.53	 Then he
GEN.24.54	 After this, he and the men who were with him ate a meal and stayed there overnight.
GEN.24.54	When they got up in the morning, he said, “Let me leave now so I can return to my master.”
GEN.24.55	 But Rebekah’s
GEN.24.56	 But he said to them, “Don’t detain me – the 
GEN.24.57	 Then they said, “We’ll call the girl and find out what she wants to do.”
GEN.24.58	 So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Do you want
GEN.24.59	 So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, accompanied by her female attendant, with Abraham’s servant and his men. 
GEN.24.60	 They blessed Rebekah with these words:
GEN.24.60	“Our sister, may you become the mother
GEN.24.60	May your descendants possess the strongholds
GEN.24.61	 Then Rebekah and her female servants mounted the camels and rode away with
GEN.24.62	 Now
GEN.24.63	 He
GEN.24.64	 Rebekah looked up
GEN.24.65	 and asked
GEN.24.66	 The servant told Isaac everything that had happened. 
GEN.24.67	 Then Isaac brought Rebekah
GEN.25.1	 Abraham had taken
GEN.25.2	 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	 Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan.
GEN.25.4	 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants
GEN.25.5	 Everything he owned Abraham left to his son Isaac. 
GEN.25.6	 But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines
GEN.25.7	 Abraham lived a total of
GEN.25.8	 Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man who had lived a full life.
GEN.25.9	 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah
GEN.25.10	 This was the field Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth.
GEN.25.11	 After Abraham’s death, God blessed
GEN.25.12	 This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael,
GEN.25.13	 These are the names of Ishmael’s sons, by their names according to their records:
GEN.25.14	 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their settlements and their camps – twelve princes
GEN.25.17	 Ishmael lived a total of
GEN.25.18	 His descendants
GEN.25.19	 This is the account of Isaac,
GEN.25.19	Abraham became the father of Isaac. 
GEN.25.20	 When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah,
GEN.25.21	 Isaac prayed to
GEN.25.22	 But the children struggled
GEN.25.23	 and the 
GEN.25.23	“Two nations
GEN.25.23	and two peoples will be separated from within you.
GEN.25.23	One people will be stronger than the other,
GEN.25.23	and the older will serve the younger.”
GEN.25.24	 When the time came for Rebekah to give birth,
GEN.25.25	 The first came out reddish
GEN.25.26	 When his brother came out with
GEN.25.27	 When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled
GEN.25.28	 Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for fresh game,
GEN.25.29	 Now Jacob cooked some stew,
GEN.25.30	 So Esau said to Jacob, “Feed
GEN.25.31	 But Jacob replied, “First
GEN.25.32	 “Look,” said Esau, “I’m about to die! What use is the birthright to me?”
GEN.25.33	 But Jacob said, “Swear an oath to me now.”
GEN.25.34	 Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew; Esau ate and drank, then got up and went out.
GEN.26.1	 There was a famine in the land, subsequent to the earlier famine that occurred
GEN.26.2	 The 
GEN.26.3	 Stay
GEN.26.4	 I will multiply your descendants so they will be as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them
GEN.26.5	 All this will come to pass
GEN.26.6	 So Isaac settled in Gerar.
GEN.26.7	 When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he replied, “She is my sister.”
GEN.26.8	 After Isaac
GEN.26.9	 So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, “She is really
GEN.26.10	 Then Abimelech exclaimed, “What in the world have you done to us?
GEN.26.11	 So Abimelech commanded all the people, “Whoever touches
GEN.26.12	 When Isaac planted in that land, he reaped in the same year a hundred times what he had sown,
GEN.26.13	 The man became wealthy.
GEN.26.14	 He had
GEN.26.15	 So the Philistines took dirt and filled up
GEN.26.16	 Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Leave us and go elsewhere,
GEN.26.17	 So Isaac left there and settled in the Gerar Valley.
GEN.26.18	 Isaac reopened
GEN.26.19	 When Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well with fresh flowing
GEN.26.20	 the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled
GEN.26.21	 His servants
GEN.26.22	 Then he moved away from there and dug another well. They did not quarrel over it, so Isaac
GEN.26.23	 From there Isaac
GEN.26.24	 The 
GEN.26.25	 Then Isaac built an altar there and worshiped
GEN.26.26	 Now Abimelech had come
GEN.26.27	 Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me? You hate me
GEN.26.28	 They replied, “We could plainly see
GEN.26.29	 so that
GEN.26.30	 So Isaac
GEN.26.31	 Early in the morning the men made a treaty with each other.
GEN.26.32	 That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. “We’ve found water,” they reported.
GEN.26.33	 So he named it Shibah;
GEN.26.34	 When
GEN.26.35	 They caused Isaac and Rebekah great anxiety.
GEN.27.1	 When
GEN.27.2	 Isaac
GEN.27.3	 Therefore, take your weapons – your quiver and your bow – and go out into the open fields and hunt down some wild game
GEN.27.4	 Then prepare for me some tasty food, the kind I love, and bring it to me. Then
GEN.27.5	 Now Rebekah had been listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau.
GEN.27.6	 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father tell your brother Esau, 
GEN.27.7	 ‘Bring me some wild game and prepare for me some tasty food. Then I will eat
GEN.27.8	 Now then, my son, do
GEN.27.9	 Go to the flock and get me two of the best young goats. I’ll prepare
GEN.27.10	 Then you will take
GEN.27.11	 “But Esau my brother is a hairy man,” Jacob protested to his mother Rebekah, “and I have smooth skin!
GEN.27.12	 My father may touch me! Then he’ll think I’m mocking him
GEN.27.13	 So his mother told him, “Any curse against you will fall on me,
GEN.27.14	 So he went and got the goats
GEN.27.15	 Then Rebekah took her older son Esau’s best clothes, which she had with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. 
GEN.27.16	 She put the skins of the young goats
GEN.27.17	 Then she handed
GEN.27.18	 He went to his father and said, “My father!” Isaac
GEN.27.19	 Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I’ve done as you told me. Now sit up
GEN.27.20	 But Isaac asked his son, “How in the world
GEN.27.21	 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come closer so I can touch you,
GEN.27.22	 So Jacob went over to his father Isaac, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s, but the hands are Esau’s.” 
GEN.27.23	 He did not recognize him because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau’s hands. So Isaac blessed Jacob.
GEN.27.24	 Then he asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” “I am,” Jacob
GEN.27.25	 Isaac
GEN.27.26	 Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here and kiss me, my son.” 
GEN.27.27	 So Jacob
GEN.27.27	“Yes,
GEN.27.27	like the scent of an open field
GEN.27.27	which the 
GEN.27.28	 May God give you
GEN.27.28	the dew of the sky
GEN.27.28	and the richness
GEN.27.28	and plenty of grain and new wine.
GEN.27.29	 May peoples serve you
GEN.27.29	and nations bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	You will be
GEN.27.29	and the sons of your mother will bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	May those who curse you be cursed,
GEN.27.29	and those who bless you be blessed.”
GEN.27.30	 Isaac had just finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely left
GEN.27.31	 He also prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Esau
GEN.27.32	 His father Isaac asked,
GEN.27.33	 Isaac began to shake violently
GEN.27.34	 When Esau heard
GEN.27.35	 But Isaac
GEN.27.36	 Esau exclaimed, “‘Jacob’ is the right name for him!
GEN.27.37	 Isaac replied to Esau, “Look! I have made him lord over you. I have made all his relatives his servants and provided him with grain and new wine. What is left that I can do for you, my son?” 
GEN.27.38	 Esau said to his father, “Do you have only that one blessing, my father? Bless me too!”
GEN.27.39	 So his father Isaac said to him,
GEN.27.39	“Indeed,
GEN.27.39	away from the richness
GEN.27.39	and away from the dew of the sky above.
GEN.27.40	 You will live by your sword
GEN.27.40	but you will serve your brother.
GEN.27.40	When you grow restless,
GEN.27.40	you will tear off his yoke
GEN.27.40	from your neck.”
GEN.27.41	 So Esau hated
GEN.27.42	 When Rebekah heard what her older son Esau had said,
GEN.27.43	 Now then, my son, do what I say.
GEN.27.44	 Live with him for a little while
GEN.27.45	 Stay there
GEN.27.46	 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am deeply depressed
GEN.28.1	 So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him, “You must not marry a Canaanite woman!
GEN.28.2	 Leave immediately
GEN.28.3	 May the sovereign God
GEN.28.4	 May he give you and your descendants the blessing he gave to Abraham
GEN.28.5	 So Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean and brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
GEN.28.6	 Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him off to Paddan Aram to find a wife there.
GEN.28.7	 Jacob obeyed his father and mother and left for Paddan Aram. 
GEN.28.8	 Then Esau realized
GEN.28.9	 So Esau went to Ishmael and married
GEN.28.10	 Meanwhile Jacob left Beer Sheba and set out for Haran. 
GEN.28.11	 He reached a certain place
GEN.28.12	 and had a dream.
GEN.28.13	 and the 
GEN.28.14	 Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth,
GEN.28.15	 I am with you!
GEN.28.16	 Then Jacob woke up
GEN.28.17	 He was afraid and said, “What an awesome place this is! This is nothing else than the house of God! This is the gate of heaven!”
GEN.28.18	 Early
GEN.28.19	 He called that place Bethel,
GEN.28.20	 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God is with me and protects me on this journey I am taking and gives me food
GEN.28.21	 and I return safely to my father’s home,
GEN.28.22	 Then this stone
GEN.29.1	 So Jacob moved on
GEN.29.2	 He saw
GEN.29.3	 When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds
GEN.29.4	 Jacob asked them, “My brothers, where are you from?” They replied, “We’re from Haran.” 
GEN.29.5	 So he said to them, “Do you know Laban, the grandson
GEN.29.6	 “Is he well?”
GEN.29.7	 Then Jacob
GEN.29.8	 “We can’t,” they said, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled off the mouth of the well. Then we water
GEN.29.9	 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep, for she was tending them.
GEN.29.10	 When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban,
GEN.29.11	 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep loudly.
GEN.29.12	 When Jacob explained
GEN.29.13	 When Laban heard this news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he rushed out to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob
GEN.29.14	 Then Laban said to him, “You are indeed my own flesh and blood.”
GEN.29.15	 Then Laban said to Jacob, “Should you work
GEN.29.16	 (Now Laban had two daughters;
GEN.29.17	 Leah’s eyes were tender,
GEN.29.18	 Since Jacob had fallen in love with
GEN.29.19	 Laban replied, “I’d rather give her to you than to another man.
GEN.29.20	 So Jacob worked for seven years to acquire Rachel.
GEN.29.21	 Finally Jacob said
GEN.29.22	 So Laban invited all the people
GEN.29.23	 In the evening he brought his daughter Leah
GEN.29.24	 (Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)
GEN.29.25	 In the morning Jacob discovered it was Leah!
GEN.29.26	 “It is not our custom here,”
GEN.29.27	 Complete my older daughter’s bridal week.
GEN.29.28	 Jacob did as Laban said.
GEN.29.29	 (Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.)
GEN.29.30	 Jacob
GEN.29.31	 When the 
GEN.29.32	 So Leah became pregnant
GEN.29.33	 She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, “Because the 
GEN.29.34	 She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, “Now this time my husband will show me affection,
GEN.29.35	 She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, “This time I will praise the 
GEN.30.1	 When Rachel saw that she could not give Jacob children, she
GEN.30.2	 Jacob became furious
GEN.30.3	 She replied, “Here is my servant Bilhah! Have sexual relations with
GEN.30.4	 So Rachel
GEN.30.5	 Bilhah became pregnant
GEN.30.6	 Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me. He has responded to my prayer
GEN.30.7	 Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, became pregnant again and gave Jacob another son.
GEN.30.8	 Then Rachel said, “I have fought a desperate struggle with my sister, but I have won.”
GEN.30.9	 When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she gave
GEN.30.10	 Soon Leah’s servant Zilpah gave Jacob a son.
GEN.30.11	 Leah said, “How fortunate!”
GEN.30.12	 Then Leah’s servant Zilpah gave Jacob another son.
GEN.30.13	 Leah said, “How happy I am,
GEN.30.14	 At the time
GEN.30.15	 But Leah replied,
GEN.30.16	 When Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must sleep
GEN.30.17	 God paid attention
GEN.30.18	 Then Leah said, “God has granted me a reward
GEN.30.19	 Leah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a son for the sixth time.
GEN.30.20	 Then Leah said, “God has given me a good gift. Now my husband will honor me because I have given him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun.
GEN.30.21	 After that she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
GEN.30.22	 Then God took note of
GEN.30.23	 She became pregnant
GEN.30.24	 She named him Joseph,
GEN.30.25	 After Rachel had given birth
GEN.30.26	 Let me take my wives and my children whom I have acquired by working for you.
GEN.30.27	 But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your sight, please stay here,
GEN.30.28	 He added, “Just name your wages – I’ll pay whatever you want.”
GEN.30.29	 “You know how I have worked for you,” Jacob replied,
GEN.30.30	 Indeed,
GEN.30.31	 So Laban asked,
GEN.30.32	 Let me walk among
GEN.30.33	 My integrity will testify for me
GEN.30.34	 “Agreed!” said Laban, “It will be as you say.”
GEN.30.35	 So that day Laban
GEN.30.36	 Then he separated them from Jacob by a three-day journey,
GEN.30.37	 But Jacob took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees. He made white streaks by peeling them, making the white inner wood in the branches visible. 
GEN.30.38	 Then he set up the peeled branches in all the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. He set up the branches in front of the flocks when they were in heat and came to drink.
GEN.30.39	 When the sheep mated
GEN.30.40	 Jacob removed these lambs, but he made the rest of the flock face
GEN.30.41	 When the stronger females were in heat,
GEN.30.42	 But if the animals were weaker, he did not set the branches there.
GEN.30.43	 In this way Jacob
GEN.31.1	 Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were complaining,
GEN.31.2	 When Jacob saw the look on Laban’s face, he could tell his attitude toward him had changed.
GEN.31.3	 The 
GEN.31.4	 So Jacob sent a message for Rachel and Leah
GEN.31.5	 There he said to them, “I can tell that your father’s attitude toward me has changed,
GEN.31.6	 You know that I’ve worked for your father as hard as I could,
GEN.31.7	 but your father has humiliated
GEN.31.8	 If he said,
GEN.31.9	 In this way God has snatched away your father’s livestock and given them to me.
GEN.31.10	 “Once
GEN.31.11	 In the dream the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ ‘Here I am!’ I replied. 
GEN.31.12	 Then he said, ‘Observe
GEN.31.13	 I am the God of Bethel,
GEN.31.14	 Then Rachel and Leah replied to him, “Do we still have any portion or inheritance
GEN.31.15	 Hasn’t he treated us like foreigners? He not only sold us, but completely wasted
GEN.31.16	 Surely all the wealth that God snatched away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So now do everything God has told you.”
GEN.31.17	 So Jacob immediately put his children and his wives on the camels.
GEN.31.18	 He took
GEN.31.19	 While Laban had gone to shear his sheep,
GEN.31.20	 Jacob also deceived
GEN.31.21	 He left
GEN.31.22	 Three days later Laban discovered Jacob had left.
GEN.31.23	 So he took his relatives
GEN.31.24	 But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and warned him,
GEN.31.25	 Laban overtook Jacob, and when Jacob pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead, Laban and his relatives set up camp there too.
GEN.31.26	 “What have you done?” Laban demanded of Jacob. “You’ve deceived me
GEN.31.27	 Why did you run away secretly
GEN.31.28	 You didn’t even allow me to kiss my daughters and my grandchildren
GEN.31.29	 I have
GEN.31.30	 Now I understand that
GEN.31.31	 “I left secretly because I was afraid!”
GEN.31.32	 Whoever has taken your gods will be put to death!
GEN.31.33	 So Laban entered Jacob’s tent, and Leah’s tent, and the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find the idols.
GEN.31.34	 (Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them inside her camel’s saddle
GEN.31.35	 Rachel
GEN.31.36	 Jacob became angry
GEN.31.37	 When you searched through all my goods, did you find anything that belonged to you?
GEN.31.38	 “I have been with you for the past twenty years. Your ewes and female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks. 
GEN.31.39	 Animals torn by wild beasts I never brought to you; I always absorbed the loss myself.
GEN.31.40	 I was consumed by scorching heat
GEN.31.41	 This was my lot
GEN.31.42	 If the God of my father – the God of Abraham, the one whom Isaac fears
GEN.31.43	 Laban replied
GEN.31.44	 So now, come, let’s make a formal agreement,
GEN.31.45	 So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial pillar. 
GEN.31.46	 Then he
GEN.31.47	 Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha,
GEN.31.48	 Laban said, “This pile of stones is a witness of our agreement
GEN.31.49	 It was also called Mizpah
GEN.31.50	 If you mistreat my daughters or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one else is with us, realize
GEN.31.51	 “Here is this pile of stones and this pillar I have set up between me and you,” Laban said to Jacob.
GEN.31.52	 “This pile of stones and the pillar are reminders that I will not pass beyond this pile to come to harm you and that you will not pass beyond this pile and this pillar to come to harm me.
GEN.31.53	 May the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor,
GEN.31.54	 Then Jacob offered a sacrifice
GEN.32.1	 So Jacob went on his way and the angels of God
GEN.32.2	 When Jacob saw them, he exclaimed,
GEN.32.3	 Jacob sent messengers on ahead
GEN.32.4	 He commanded them, “This is what you must say to my lord Esau: ‘This is what your servant
GEN.32.5	 I have oxen, donkeys, sheep, and male and female servants. I have sent
GEN.32.6	 The messengers returned to Jacob and said, “We went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you and has four hundred men with him.” 
GEN.32.7	 Jacob was very afraid and upset. So he divided the people who were with him into two camps, as well as the flocks, herds, and camels. 
GEN.32.8	 “If Esau attacks one camp,”
GEN.32.9	 Then Jacob prayed,
GEN.32.10	 I am not worthy of all the faithful love
GEN.32.11	 Rescue me,
GEN.32.12	 But you
GEN.32.13	 Jacob
GEN.32.14	 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	 thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. 
GEN.32.16	 He entrusted them to
GEN.32.17	 He instructed the servant leading the first herd,
GEN.32.18	 then you must say,
GEN.32.19	 He also gave these instructions to the second and third servants, as well as all those who were following the herds, saying, “You must say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
GEN.32.20	 You must also say, ‘In fact your servant Jacob is behind us.’”
GEN.32.21	 So the gifts were sent on ahead of him
GEN.32.22	 During the night Jacob quickly took
GEN.32.23	 He took them and sent them across the stream along with all his possessions.
GEN.32.24	 So Jacob was left alone. Then a man
GEN.32.25	 When the man
GEN.32.26	 Then the man
GEN.32.27	 The man asked him,
GEN.32.28	 “No longer will your name be Jacob,” the man told him,
GEN.32.29	 Then Jacob asked, “Please tell me your name.”
GEN.32.30	 So Jacob named the place Peniel,
GEN.32.31	 The sun rose
GEN.32.32	 That is why to this day
GEN.33.1	 Jacob looked up
GEN.33.2	 He put the servants and their children in front, with Leah and her children behind them, and Rachel and Joseph behind them.
GEN.33.3	 But Jacob
GEN.33.4	 But Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, hugged his neck, and kissed him. Then they both wept. 
GEN.33.5	 When Esau
GEN.33.6	 The female servants came forward with their children and bowed down.
GEN.33.7	 Then Leah came forward with her children and they bowed down. Finally Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed down.
GEN.33.8	 Esau
GEN.33.9	 But Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother. Keep what belongs to you.” 
GEN.33.10	 “No, please take them,” Jacob said.
GEN.33.11	 Please take my present
GEN.33.12	 Then Esau
GEN.33.13	 But Jacob
GEN.33.14	 Let my lord go on ahead of his servant. I will travel more slowly, at the pace of the herds and the children,
GEN.33.15	 So Esau said, “Let me leave some of my men with you.”
GEN.33.16	 So that same day Esau made his way back
GEN.33.17	 But
GEN.33.18	 After he left Paddan Aram, Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped near
GEN.33.19	 Then he purchased the portion of the field where he had pitched his tent; he bought it
GEN.33.20	 There he set up an altar and called it “The God of Israel is God.”
GEN.34.1	 Now Dinah, Leah’s daughter whom she bore to Jacob, went to meet
GEN.34.2	 When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, who ruled that area, saw her, he grabbed her, forced himself on her,
GEN.34.3	 Then he became very attached
GEN.34.4	 Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Acquire this young girl as my wife.”
GEN.34.5	 When
GEN.34.6	 Then Shechem’s father Hamor went to speak with Jacob about Dinah.
GEN.34.7	 Now Jacob’s sons had come in from the field when they heard the news.
GEN.34.8	 But Hamor made this appeal to them: “My son Shechem is in love with your daughter.
GEN.34.9	 Intermarry with us.
GEN.34.10	 You may live
GEN.34.11	 Then Shechem said to Dinah’s
GEN.34.12	 You can make the bride price and the gift I must bring very expensive,
GEN.34.13	 Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully when they spoke because Shechem
GEN.34.14	 They said to them, “We cannot give
GEN.34.15	 We will give you our consent on this one condition: You must become
GEN.34.16	 Then we will give
GEN.34.17	 But if you do not agree to our terms
GEN.34.18	 Their offer pleased Hamor and his son Shechem.
GEN.34.19	 The young man did not delay in doing what they asked
GEN.34.20	 So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate
GEN.34.21	 “These men are at peace with us. So let them live in the land and travel freely in it, for the land is wide enough
GEN.34.22	 Only on this one condition will these men consent to live with us and become one people: They demand
GEN.34.23	 If we do so,
GEN.34.24	 All the men who assembled at the city gate
GEN.34.25	 In three days, when they were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword
GEN.34.26	 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and left. 
GEN.34.27	 Jacob’s sons killed them
GEN.34.28	 They took their flocks, herds, and donkeys, as well as everything in the city and in the surrounding fields.
GEN.34.29	 They captured as plunder
GEN.34.30	 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought ruin
GEN.34.31	 But Simeon and Levi replied,
GEN.35.1	 Then God said to Jacob, “Go up at once
GEN.35.2	 So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have among you.
GEN.35.3	 Let us go up at once
GEN.35.4	 So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods that were in their possession
GEN.35.5	 and they started on their journey.
GEN.35.6	 Jacob and all those who were with him arrived at Luz (that is, Bethel)
GEN.35.7	 He built an altar there and named the place El Bethel
GEN.35.8	 (Deborah,
GEN.35.9	 God appeared to Jacob again after he returned from Paddan Aram and blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	 God said to him, “Your name is Jacob, but your name will no longer be called Jacob; Israel will be your name.” So God named him Israel.
GEN.35.11	 Then God said to him, “I am the sovereign God.
GEN.35.12	 The land I gave
GEN.35.13	 Then God went up from the place
GEN.35.14	 So Jacob set up a sacred stone pillar in the place where God spoke with him.
GEN.35.15	 Jacob named the place
GEN.35.16	 They traveled on from Bethel, and when Ephrath was still some distance away,
GEN.35.17	 When her labor was at its hardest,
GEN.35.18	 With her dying breath,
GEN.35.19	 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
GEN.35.20	 Jacob set up a marker
GEN.35.21	 Then Israel traveled on and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.
GEN.35.22	 While Israel was living in that land, Reuben had sexual relations with
GEN.35.22	Jacob had twelve sons: 
GEN.35.23	 The sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, as well as Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
GEN.35.24	 The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.35.25	 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, were Dan and Naphtali.
GEN.35.26	 The sons of Zilpah, Leah’s servant, were Gad and Asher.
GEN.35.26	These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan Aram. 
GEN.35.27	 So Jacob came back to his father Isaac in Mamre,
GEN.35.28	 Isaac lived to be 180 years old.
GEN.35.29	 Then Isaac breathed his last and joined his ancestors.
GEN.36.1	 What follows is the account of Esau (also known as Edom).
GEN.36.2	 Esau took his wives from the Canaanites:
GEN.36.3	 in addition to Basemath the daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
GEN.36.4	 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel, 
GEN.36.5	 and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
GEN.36.6	 Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, all the people in his household, his livestock, his animals, and all his possessions which he had acquired in the land of Canaan and went to a land some distance away from
GEN.36.7	 because they had too many possessions to be able to stay together and the land where they had settled
GEN.36.8	 So Esau (also known as Edom) lived in the hill country of Seir.
GEN.36.9	 This is the account of Esau, the father
GEN.36.10	 These were the names of Esau’s sons:
GEN.36.10	Eliphaz, the son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.11	 The sons of Eliphaz were:
GEN.36.11	Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
GEN.36.12	 Timna, a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz, bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons
GEN.36.13	 These were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons
GEN.36.14	 These were the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and granddaughter
GEN.36.15	 These were the chiefs
GEN.36.16	 chief Korah,
GEN.36.17	 These were the sons of Esau’s son Reuel: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom; these were the sons
GEN.36.18	 These were the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These were the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
GEN.36.19	 These were the sons of Esau (also known as Edom), and these were their chiefs.
GEN.36.20	 These were the sons of Seir the Horite,
GEN.36.21	 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, the descendants
GEN.36.22	 The sons of Lotan were Hori and Homam;
GEN.36.23	 These were the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho,
GEN.36.24	 These were the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah (who discovered the hot springs
GEN.36.25	 These were the children
GEN.36.26	 These were the sons of Dishon:
GEN.36.27	 These were the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
GEN.36.28	 These were the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
GEN.36.29	 These were the chiefs of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah, 
GEN.36.30	 chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, according to their chief lists in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.31	 These were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites:
GEN.36.32	 Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
GEN.36.33	 When Bela died, Jobab the son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.34	 When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.
GEN.36.35	 When Husham died, Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated the Midianites in the land of Moab, reigned in his place; the name of his city was Avith.
GEN.36.36	 When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place.
GEN.36.37	 When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth by the River
GEN.36.38	 When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.39	 When Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor died, Hadad
GEN.36.40	 These were the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families, according to their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth, 
GEN.36.41	 chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,

GEN.37.1	 But Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed,
GEN.37.2	 This is the account of Jacob.
GEN.37.2	Joseph, his seventeen-year-old son,
GEN.37.3	 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons
GEN.37.4	 When Joseph’s
GEN.37.5	 Joseph
GEN.37.6	 He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:
GEN.37.7	 There we were,
GEN.37.8	 Then his brothers asked him, “Do you really think you will rule over us or have dominion over us?”
GEN.37.9	 Then he had another dream,
GEN.37.10	 When he told his father and his brothers, his father rebuked him, saying, “What is this dream that you had?
GEN.37.11	 His brothers were jealous
GEN.37.12	 When his brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem, 
GEN.37.13	 Israel said to Joseph, “Your brothers
GEN.37.14	 So Jacob
GEN.37.15	 When Joseph reached Shechem,
GEN.37.16	 He replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Please tell
GEN.37.17	 The man said, “They left this area,
GEN.37.18	 Now Joseph’s brothers
GEN.37.19	 They said to one another, “Here comes this master of dreams!
GEN.37.20	 Come now, let’s kill him, throw him into one of the cisterns, and then say that a wild
GEN.37.21	 When Reuben heard this, he rescued Joseph
GEN.37.22	 Reuben continued,
GEN.37.23	 When Joseph reached his brothers, they stripped him
GEN.37.24	 Then they took him and threw him into the cistern. (Now the cistern was empty;
GEN.37.25	 When they sat down to eat their food, they looked up
GEN.37.26	 Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? 
GEN.37.27	 Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, but let’s not lay a hand on him,
GEN.37.28	 So when the Midianite
GEN.37.29	 Later Reuben returned to the cistern to find that Joseph was not in it!
GEN.37.30	 returned to his brothers, and said, “The boy isn’t there! And I, where can I go?” 
GEN.37.31	 So they took Joseph’s tunic, killed a young goat,
GEN.37.32	 Then they brought the special tunic to their father
GEN.37.33	 He recognized it and exclaimed, “It is my son’s tunic! A wild animal has eaten him!
GEN.37.34	 Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth,
GEN.37.35	 All his sons and daughters stood by
GEN.37.36	 Now
GEN.38.1	 At that time Judah left
GEN.38.2	 There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man
GEN.38.3	 She became pregnant
GEN.38.4	 She became pregnant again and had another son, whom she named Onan. 
GEN.38.5	 Then she had
GEN.38.6	 Judah acquired
GEN.38.7	 But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the 
GEN.38.8	 Then Judah said to Onan, “Have sexual relations with
GEN.38.9	 But Onan knew that the child
GEN.38.10	 What he did was evil in the 
GEN.38.11	 Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s house until Shelah my son grows up.” For he thought,
GEN.38.12	 After some time
GEN.38.13	 Tamar was told,
GEN.38.14	 So she removed her widow’s clothes and covered herself with a veil. She wrapped herself and sat at the entrance to Enaim which is on the way to Timnah. (She did this because
GEN.38.15	 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute
GEN.38.16	 He turned aside to her along the road and said, “Come on! I want to have sex with you.”
GEN.38.17	 He replied, “I’ll send you a young goat from the flock.” She asked, “Will you give me a pledge until you send it?”
GEN.38.18	 He said, “What pledge should I give you?” She replied, “Your seal, your cord, and the staff that’s in your hand.” So he gave them to her and had sex with her.
GEN.38.19	 She left immediately,
GEN.38.20	 Then Judah had his friend Hirah
GEN.38.21	 He asked the men who were there,
GEN.38.22	 So he returned to Judah and said, “I couldn’t find her. Moreover, the men of the place said, ‘There has been no cult prostitute here.’” 
GEN.38.23	 Judah said, “Let her keep the things
GEN.38.24	 After three months Judah was told,
GEN.38.25	 While they were bringing her out, she sent word
GEN.38.26	 Judah recognized them and said, “She is more upright
GEN.38.27	 When it was time for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.38.28	 While she was giving birth, one child
GEN.38.29	 But then he drew back his hand, and his brother came out before him.
GEN.38.30	 Afterward his brother came out – the one who had the scarlet thread on his hand – and he was named Zerah.
GEN.39.1	 Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt.
GEN.39.2	 The 
GEN.39.3	 His master observed that the 
GEN.39.4	 So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal attendant.
GEN.39.5	 From the time
GEN.39.6	 So Potiphar
GEN.39.6	Now Joseph was well built and good-looking.
GEN.39.7	 Soon after these things, his master’s wife took notice of
GEN.39.8	 But he refused, saying
GEN.39.9	 There is no one greater in this household than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife. So how could I do
GEN.39.10	 Even though she continued to speak
GEN.39.11	 One day
GEN.39.12	 She grabbed him by his outer garment, saying, “Have sex with me!” But he left his outer garment in her hand and ran
GEN.39.13	 When she saw that he had left his outer garment in her hand and had run outside, 
GEN.39.14	 she called for her household servants and said to them, “See, my husband brought
GEN.39.15	 When he heard me raise
GEN.39.16	 So she laid his outer garment beside her until his master came home. 
GEN.39.17	 This is what she said to him:
GEN.39.18	 but when I raised my voice and screamed, he left his outer garment and ran outside.”
GEN.39.19	 When his master heard his wife say,
GEN.39.20	 Joseph’s master took him and threw him into the prison,
GEN.39.21	 But the 
GEN.39.22	 The warden put all the prisoners under Joseph’s care. He was in charge of whatever they were doing.
GEN.39.23	 The warden did not concern himself
GEN.40.1	 After these things happened, the cupbearer
GEN.40.2	 Pharaoh was enraged with his two officials,
GEN.40.3	 so he imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard in the same facility where Joseph was confined. 
GEN.40.4	 The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be their attendant, and he served them.
GEN.40.4	They spent some time in custody.
GEN.40.5	 Both of them, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, had a dream
GEN.40.6	 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were looking depressed.
GEN.40.7	 So he asked Pharaoh’s officials, who were with him in custody in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?”
GEN.40.8	 They told him, “We both had dreams,
GEN.40.9	 So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph:
GEN.40.10	 On the vine there were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes. 
GEN.40.11	 Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, so I took the grapes, squeezed them into his
GEN.40.12	 “This is its meaning,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches represent
GEN.40.13	 In three more days Pharaoh will reinstate you
GEN.40.14	 But remember me
GEN.40.15	 for I really was kidnapped
GEN.40.16	 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation of the first dream was favorable,
GEN.40.17	 In the top basket there were baked goods of every kind for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them from the basket that was on my head.”
GEN.40.18	 Joseph replied, “This is its meaning: The three baskets represent
GEN.40.19	 In three more days Pharaoh will decapitate you
GEN.40.20	 On the third day it was Pharaoh’s birthday, so he gave a feast for all his servants. He “lifted up”
GEN.40.21	 He restored the chief cupbearer to his former position
GEN.40.22	 but the chief baker he impaled, just as Joseph had predicted.
GEN.40.23	 But the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph – he forgot him.
GEN.41.1	 At the end of two full years
GEN.41.2	 seven fine-looking, fat cows were coming up out of the Nile,
GEN.41.3	 Then seven bad-looking, thin cows were coming up after them from the Nile,
GEN.41.4	 The bad-looking, thin cows ate the seven fine-looking, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
GEN.41.5	 Then he fell asleep again and had a second dream: There were seven heads of grain growing
GEN.41.6	 Then
GEN.41.7	 The thin heads swallowed up the seven healthy and full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up and realized it was a dream.
GEN.41.8	 In the morning he
GEN.41.9	 Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I recall my failures.
GEN.41.10	 Pharaoh was enraged with his servants, and he put me in prison in the house of the captain of the guards – me and the chief baker. 
GEN.41.11	 We each had a dream one night; each of us had a dream with its own meaning.
GEN.41.12	 Now a young man, a Hebrew, a servant
GEN.41.13	 It happened just as he had said
GEN.41.14	 Then Pharaoh summoned
GEN.41.15	 Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream,
GEN.41.16	 Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “It is not within my power,
GEN.41.17	 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing
GEN.41.18	 Then seven fat and fine-looking cows were coming up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the reeds.
GEN.41.19	 Then
GEN.41.20	 The lean, bad-looking cows ate up the seven
GEN.41.21	 When they had eaten them,
GEN.41.22	 I also saw in my dream
GEN.41.23	 Then
GEN.41.24	 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. So I told all this
GEN.41.25	 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Both dreams of Pharaoh have the same meaning.
GEN.41.26	 The seven good cows represent seven years, and the seven good heads of grain represent seven years. Both dreams have the same meaning.
GEN.41.27	 The seven lean, bad-looking cows that came up after them represent seven years, as do the seven empty heads of grain burned with the east wind. They represent
GEN.41.28	 This is just what I told
GEN.41.29	 Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the whole land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.30	 But seven years of famine will occur
GEN.41.31	 The previous abundance of the land will not be remembered
GEN.41.32	 The dream was repeated to Pharaoh
GEN.41.33	 “So now Pharaoh should look
GEN.41.34	 Pharaoh should do
GEN.41.35	 They should gather all the excess food
GEN.41.36	 This food should be held in storage for the land in preparation for the seven years of famine that will occur throughout the land of Egypt. In this way the land will survive the famine.”
GEN.41.37	 This advice made sense to Pharaoh and all his officials.
GEN.41.38	 So Pharaoh asked his officials, “Can we find a man like Joseph,
GEN.41.39	 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has enabled you to know all this, there is no one as wise and discerning
GEN.41.40	 You will oversee my household, and all my people will submit to your commands.
GEN.41.41	 “See here,” Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I place
GEN.41.42	 Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his own hand and put it on Joseph’s. He clothed him with fine linen
GEN.41.43	 Pharaoh
GEN.41.44	 Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your permission
GEN.41.45	 Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah.
GEN.41.46	 Now Joseph was 30 years old
GEN.41.47	 During the seven years of abundance the land produced large, bountiful harvests.
GEN.41.48	 Joseph
GEN.41.49	 Joseph stored up a vast amount of grain, like the sand of the sea,
GEN.41.50	 Two sons were born to Joseph before the famine came.
GEN.41.51	 Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh,
GEN.41.52	 He named the second child Ephraim,
GEN.41.53	 The seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end. 
GEN.41.54	 Then the seven years of famine began,
GEN.41.55	 When all the land of Egypt experienced the famine, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. Pharaoh said to all the people of Egypt,
GEN.41.56	 While the famine was over all the earth,
GEN.41.57	 People from every country
GEN.42.1	 When Jacob heard
GEN.42.2	 He then said, “Look, I hear that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy grain for us
GEN.42.3	 So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	 But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers,
GEN.42.5	 So Israel’s sons came to buy grain among the other travelers,
GEN.42.6	 Now Joseph was the ruler of the country, the one who sold grain to all the people of the country.
GEN.42.7	 When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger
GEN.42.8	 Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. 
GEN.42.9	 Then Joseph remembered
GEN.42.10	 But they exclaimed,
GEN.42.11	 We are all the sons of one man; we are honest men! Your servants are not spies.”
GEN.42.12	 “No,” he insisted, “but you have come to see if our land is vulnerable.”
GEN.42.13	 They replied, “Your servants are from a family of twelve brothers.
GEN.42.14	 But Joseph told them, “It is just as I said to you:
GEN.42.15	 You will be tested in this way: As surely as Pharaoh lives,
GEN.42.16	 One of you must go and get
GEN.42.17	 He imprisoned
GEN.42.18	 On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do as I say
GEN.42.19	 If you are honest men, leave one of your brothers confined here in prison
GEN.42.20	 But you must bring
GEN.42.21	 They said to one other,
GEN.42.22	 Reuben said to them, “Didn’t I say to you, ‘Don’t sin against the boy,’ but you wouldn’t listen? So now we must pay for shedding his blood!”
GEN.42.23	 (Now
GEN.42.24	 He turned away from them and wept. When he turned around and spoke to them again,
GEN.42.25	 Then Joseph gave orders to fill
GEN.42.26	 So they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
GEN.42.27	 When one of them
GEN.42.28	 He said to his brothers, “My money was returned! Here it is in my sack!” They were dismayed;
GEN.42.29	 They returned to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan and told him all the things that had happened to them, saying, 
GEN.42.30	 “The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and treated us
GEN.42.31	 But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies! 
GEN.42.32	 We are from a family of twelve brothers; we are the sons of one father.
GEN.42.33	 “Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘This is how I will find out if you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain
GEN.42.34	 But bring your youngest brother back to me so I will know
GEN.42.35	 When they were emptying their sacks, there was each man’s bag of money in his sack! When they and their father saw the bags of money, they were afraid. 
GEN.42.36	 Their father Jacob said to them, “You are making me childless! Joseph is gone.
GEN.42.37	 Then Reuben said to his father, “You may
GEN.42.38	 But Jacob
GEN.43.1	 Now the famine was severe in the land.
GEN.43.2	 When they finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Return, buy us a little more food.” 
GEN.43.3	 But Judah said to him, “The man solemnly warned
GEN.43.4	 If you send
GEN.43.5	 But if you will not send him, we won’t go down there because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’”
GEN.43.6	 Israel said, “Why did you bring this trouble
GEN.43.7	 They replied, “The man questioned us
GEN.43.8	 Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me and we will go immediately.
GEN.43.9	 I myself pledge security
GEN.43.10	 But if we had not delayed, we could have traveled there and back
GEN.43.11	 Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and take a gift down to the man – a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachios and almonds. 
GEN.43.12	 Take double the money with you;
GEN.43.13	 Take your brother too, and go right away
GEN.43.14	 May the sovereign God
GEN.43.15	 So the men took these gifts, and they took double the money with them, along with Benjamin. Then they hurried down to Egypt
GEN.43.16	 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the servant who was over his household, “Bring the men to the house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for the men will eat with me at noon.” 
GEN.43.17	 The man did just as Joseph said; he
GEN.43.18	 But the men were afraid when they were brought to Joseph’s house. They said, “We are being brought in because of
GEN.43.19	 So they approached the man who was in charge of Joseph’s household and spoke to him at the entrance to the house. 
GEN.43.20	 They said, “My lord, we did indeed come down
GEN.43.21	 But when we came to the place where we spent the night, we opened our sacks and each of us found his money – the full amount
GEN.43.22	 We have brought additional money with us to buy food. We do not know who put the money in our sacks!”
GEN.43.23	 “Everything is fine,”
GEN.43.24	 The servant in charge
GEN.43.25	 They got their gifts ready for Joseph’s arrival
GEN.43.26	 When Joseph came home, they presented him with the gifts they had brought inside,
GEN.43.27	 He asked them how they were doing.
GEN.43.28	 “Your servant our father is well,” they replied. “He is still alive.” They bowed down in humility.
GEN.43.29	 When Joseph looked up
GEN.43.30	 Joseph hurried out, for he was overcome by affection for his brother
GEN.43.31	 Then he washed his face and came out. With composure he said,
GEN.43.32	 They set a place for him, a separate place for his brothers,
GEN.43.33	 They sat before him, arranged by order of birth, beginning with the firstborn and ending with the youngest.
GEN.43.34	 He gave them portions of the food set before him,
GEN.44.1	 He instructed the servant who was over his household, “Fill the sacks of the men with as much food as they can carry and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack. 
GEN.44.2	 Then put
GEN.44.3	 When morning came,
GEN.44.4	 They had not gone very far from the city
GEN.44.5	 Doesn’t my master drink from this cup
GEN.44.6	 When the man
GEN.44.7	 They answered him, “Why does my lord say such things?
GEN.44.8	 Look, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. Why then would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house? 
GEN.44.9	 If one of us has it,
GEN.44.10	 He replied, “You have suggested your own punishment!
GEN.44.11	 So each man quickly lowered
GEN.44.12	 Then the man
GEN.44.13	 They all tore their clothes! Then each man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	 So Judah and his brothers
GEN.44.15	 Joseph said to them, “What did you think you were doing?
GEN.44.16	 Judah replied, “What can we say
GEN.44.17	 But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found will become my slave, but the rest of
GEN.44.18	 Then Judah approached him and said, “My lord, please allow your servant to speak a word with you.
GEN.44.19	 My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	 We said to my lord, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young boy who was born when our father was old.
GEN.44.21	 “Then you told your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I can see
GEN.44.22	 We said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he leaves his father, his father
GEN.44.23	 But you said to your servants, ‘If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you will not see my face again.’ 
GEN.44.24	 When we returned to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 
GEN.44.25	 “Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy us a little food.’ 
GEN.44.26	 But we replied, ‘We cannot go down there.
GEN.44.27	 “Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife gave me two sons.
GEN.44.28	 The first disappeared
GEN.44.29	 If you take
GEN.44.30	 “So now, when I return to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us – his very life is bound up in his son’s life.
GEN.44.31	 When he sees the boy is not with us,
GEN.44.32	 Indeed,
GEN.44.33	 “So now, please let your servant remain as my lord’s slave instead of the boy. As for the boy, let him go back with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	 For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I couldn’t bear to see
GEN.45.1	 Joseph was no longer able to control himself before all his attendants,
GEN.45.2	 He wept loudly;
GEN.45.3	 Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” His brothers could not answer him because they were dumbfounded before him. 
GEN.45.4	 Joseph said to his brothers, “Come closer to me,” so they came near. Then he said, “I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	 Now, do not be upset and do not be angry with yourselves because you sold me here,
GEN.45.6	 For these past two years there has been famine in
GEN.45.7	 God sent me
GEN.45.8	 So now, it is not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me an adviser
GEN.45.9	 Now go up to my father quickly
GEN.45.10	 You will live
GEN.45.11	 I will provide you with food
GEN.45.12	 You and my brother Benjamin can certainly see with your own eyes that I really am the one who speaks to you.
GEN.45.13	 So tell
GEN.45.14	 Then he threw himself on the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. 
GEN.45.15	 He kissed all his brothers and wept over them. After this his brothers talked with him.
GEN.45.16	 Now it was reported
GEN.45.17	 Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and go
GEN.45.18	 Get your father and your households and come to me! Then I will give you
GEN.45.19	 You are also commanded to say,
GEN.45.20	 Don’t worry
GEN.45.21	 So the sons of Israel did as he said.
GEN.45.22	 He gave sets of clothes to each one of them,
GEN.45.23	 To his father he sent the following:
GEN.45.24	 Then he sent his brothers on their way and they left. He said to them, “As you travel don’t be overcome with fear.”
GEN.45.25	 So they went up from Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
GEN.45.26	 They told him, “Joseph is still alive and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!” Jacob was stunned,
GEN.45.27	 But when they related to him everything Joseph had said to them,
GEN.45.28	 Then Israel said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I will go and see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	 So Israel began his journey, taking with him all that he had.
GEN.46.2	 God spoke to Israel in a vision during the night
GEN.46.3	 He said, “I am God,
GEN.46.4	 I will go down with you to Egypt and I myself will certainly bring you back from there.
GEN.46.5	 Then Jacob started out
GEN.46.6	 Jacob and all his descendants took their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and they went to Egypt.
GEN.46.7	 He brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons,
GEN.46.8	 These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt – Jacob and his sons:
GEN.46.8	Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob.

GEN.46.13	 The sons of Issachar:
GEN.46.13	Tola, Puah,
GEN.46.14	 The sons of Zebulun:

GEN.46.15	 These were the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, along with Dinah his daughter. His sons and daughters numbered thirty-three in all.
GEN.46.16	 The sons of Gad:
GEN.46.16	Zephon,
GEN.46.17	 The sons of Asher:

GEN.46.17	The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malkiel.
GEN.46.18	 These were the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter. She bore these to Jacob, sixteen in all.
GEN.46.19	 The sons of Rachel the wife of Jacob: 
GEN.46.19	Joseph and Benjamin.

GEN.46.25	 These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter. She bore these to Jacob, seven in all.
GEN.46.26	 All the direct descendants of Jacob who went to Egypt with him were sixty-six in number. (This number does not include the wives of Jacob’s sons.)
GEN.46.27	 Counting the two sons
GEN.46.28	 Jacob
GEN.46.29	 Joseph harnessed his chariot and went up to meet his father Israel in Goshen. When he met him,
GEN.46.30	 Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.”
GEN.46.31	 Then Joseph said to his brothers and his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh,
GEN.46.32	 The men are shepherds;
GEN.46.33	 Pharaoh will summon you and say, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
GEN.46.34	 Tell him, ‘Your servants have taken care of cattle
GEN.47.1	 Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father, my brothers, their flocks and herds, and all that they own have arrived from the land of 
GEN.47.1	Canaan. They are now
GEN.47.2	 He took five of his brothers and introduced them to Pharaoh.
GEN.47.3	 Pharaoh said to Joseph’s
GEN.47.4	 Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as temporary residents
GEN.47.5	 Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
GEN.47.6	 The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best region of the land. They may live in the land of Goshen. If you know of any highly capable men
GEN.47.7	 Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him
GEN.47.8	 Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How long have you lived?”
GEN.47.9	 Jacob said to Pharaoh, “All
GEN.47.10	 Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.
GEN.47.11	 So Joseph settled his father and his brothers. He gave them territory
GEN.47.12	 Joseph also provided food for his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household, according to the number of their little children.
GEN.47.13	 But there was no food in all the land because the famine was very severe; the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan wasted away
GEN.47.14	 Joseph collected all the money that could be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan as payment
GEN.47.15	 When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was used up, all the Egyptians
GEN.47.16	 Then Joseph said, “If your money is gone, bring your livestock, and I will give you food
GEN.47.17	 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for their horses, the livestock of their flocks and herds, and their donkeys.
GEN.47.18	 When that year was over, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We cannot hide from our
GEN.47.19	 Why should we die before your very eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we, with our land, will become
GEN.47.20	 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. Each
GEN.47.21	 Joseph
GEN.47.22	 But he did not purchase the land of the priests because the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh and they ate from their allotment that Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.
GEN.47.23	 Joseph said to the people, “Since I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you. Cultivate
GEN.47.24	 When you gather in the crop,
GEN.47.25	 They replied, “You have saved our lives! You are showing us favor,
GEN.47.26	 So Joseph made it a statute,
GEN.47.27	 Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they owned land there. They were fruitful and increased rapidly in number.
GEN.47.28	 Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; the years
GEN.47.29	 The time
GEN.47.30	 but when I rest
GEN.47.31	 Jacob
GEN.48.1	 After these things Joseph was told,
GEN.48.2	 When Jacob was told,
GEN.48.3	 Jacob said to Joseph, “The sovereign God
GEN.48.4	 He said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful
GEN.48.5	 “Now, as for your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, they will be mine.
GEN.48.6	 Any children that you father
GEN.48.7	 But as for me, when I was returning from Paddan, Rachel died – to my sorrow
GEN.48.8	 When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he asked, “Who are these?” 
GEN.48.9	 Joseph said to his father, “They are the
GEN.48.10	 Now Israel’s eyes were failing
GEN.48.11	 Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected
GEN.48.12	 So Joseph moved them from Israel’s knees
GEN.48.13	 Joseph positioned them;
GEN.48.14	 Israel stretched out his right hand and placed it on Ephraim’s head, although he was the younger.
GEN.48.15	 Then he blessed Joseph and said, 
GEN.48.15	“May the God before whom my fathers 
GEN.48.15	Abraham and Isaac walked – 
GEN.48.15	the God who has been my shepherd
GEN.48.15	all my life long to this day,
GEN.48.16	 the Angel
GEN.48.16	from all harm – 
GEN.48.16	bless these boys.
GEN.48.16	May my name be named in them,
GEN.48.16	and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.
GEN.48.16	May they grow into a multitude on the earth.”
GEN.48.17	 When Joseph saw that his father placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head, it displeased him.
GEN.48.18	 Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”
GEN.48.19	 But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a nation and he too will become great. In spite of this, his younger brother will be even greater and his descendants will become a multitude
GEN.48.20	 So he blessed them that day, saying, 
GEN.48.20	“By you
GEN.48.20	‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’”
GEN.48.20	So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
GEN.48.21	 Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you
GEN.48.22	 As one who is above your
GEN.49.1	 Jacob called for his sons and said, “Gather together so I can tell you
GEN.49.2	 “Assemble and listen, you sons of Jacob;
GEN.49.2	listen to Israel, your father.

GEN.49.4	 You are destructive
GEN.49.4	for you got on your father’s bed,
GEN.49.4	then you defiled it – he got on my couch!
GEN.49.5	 Simeon and Levi are brothers,
GEN.49.5	weapons of violence are their knives!
GEN.49.6	 O my soul, do not come into their council,
GEN.49.6	do not be united to their assembly, my heart,
GEN.49.6	for in their anger they have killed men,
GEN.49.6	and for pleasure they have hamstrung oxen.
GEN.49.7	 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce,
GEN.49.7	and their fury, for it was cruel.
GEN.49.7	I will divide them in Jacob,
GEN.49.7	and scatter them in Israel!

GEN.49.9	He crouches and lies down like a lion;
GEN.49.9	like a lioness – who will rouse him?
GEN.49.10	 The scepter will not depart from Judah,
GEN.49.10	nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,
GEN.49.10	until he comes to whom it belongs;
GEN.49.10	the nations will obey him.
GEN.49.11	 Binding his foal to the vine,
GEN.49.11	and his colt to the choicest vine,
GEN.49.11	he will wash
GEN.49.11	his robes in the blood of grapes.
GEN.49.12	 His eyes will be dark from wine,
GEN.49.12	and his teeth white from milk.
GEN.49.13	 Zebulun will live

GEN.49.25	with blessings from the sky above,
GEN.49.25	blessings from the deep that lies below,
GEN.49.25	and blessings of the breasts and womb.
GEN.49.26	 The blessings of your father are greater 
GEN.49.26	than
GEN.49.26	or the desirable things of the age-old hills.
GEN.49.26	They will be on the head of Joseph
GEN.49.26	and on the brow of the prince of his brothers.

GEN.49.30	 It is the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought for a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite. 
GEN.49.31	 There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah; there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah; and there I buried Leah. 
GEN.49.32	 The field and the cave in it were acquired from the sons of Heth.”
GEN.49.33	 When Jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons, he pulled his feet up onto the bed, breathed his last breath, and went
GEN.50.1	 Then Joseph hugged his father’s face.
GEN.50.2	 Joseph instructed the physicians in his service
GEN.50.3	 They took forty days, for that is the full time needed for embalming.
GEN.50.4	 When the days of mourning
GEN.50.5	 ‘My father made me swear an oath. He said,
GEN.50.6	 So Pharaoh said, “Go and bury your father, just as he made you swear to do.”
GEN.50.7	 So Joseph went up to bury his father; all Pharaoh’s officials went with him – the senior courtiers
GEN.50.8	 all Joseph’s household, his brothers, and his father’s household. But they left their little children and their flocks and herds in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	 Chariots and horsemen also went up with him, so it was a very large entourage.
GEN.50.10	 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad
GEN.50.11	 When the Canaanites who lived in the land saw them mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a very sad occasion
GEN.50.12	 So the sons of Jacob did for him just as he had instructed them. 
GEN.50.13	 His sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, near Mamre. This is the field Abraham purchased as a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite. 
GEN.50.14	 After he buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, along with his brothers and all who had accompanied him to bury his father.
GEN.50.15	 When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph bears a grudge and wants to repay
GEN.50.16	 So they sent word
GEN.50.17	 ‘Tell Joseph this: Please forgive the sin of your brothers and the wrong they did when they treated you so badly.’ Now please forgive the sin of the servants of the God of your father.” When this message was reported to him, Joseph wept.
GEN.50.18	 Then his brothers also came and threw themselves down before him; they said, “Here we are; we are your slaves.” 
GEN.50.19	 But Joseph answered them, “Don’t be afraid. Am
GEN.50.20	 As for you, you meant to harm me,
GEN.50.21	 So now, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your little children.” Then he consoled them and spoke kindly
GEN.50.22	 Joseph lived in Egypt, along with his father’s family.
GEN.50.23	 Joseph saw the descendants of Ephraim to the third generation.
GEN.50.24	 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to you
GEN.50.25	 Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath. He said, “God will surely come to you. Then you must carry my bones up from this place.” 
GEN.50.26	 So Joseph died at the age of 110.

EXO.7.24	 All the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink,
EXO.7.25	 Seven full days passed
EXO.8.2	 But if you refuse to release them, then I am going to plague
EXO.8.3	 The Nile will swarm

EXO.8.10	 He said, “Tomorrow.” And Moses said,
EXO.8.11	 The frogs will depart from you, your houses, your servants, and your people; they will be left only in the Nile.”
EXO.8.12	 Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried
EXO.8.13	 The 
EXO.8.14	 The Egyptians
EXO.8.15	 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief,
EXO.8.16	 The 
EXO.8.17	 They did so; Aaron extended his hand with his staff, he struck the dust of the ground, and it became gnats on people
EXO.8.18	 When
EXO.8.19	 The magicians said
EXO.8.20	 The 
EXO.8.21	 If you do not release
EXO.8.22	 But on that day I will mark off
EXO.8.23	 I will put a division

EXO.8.27	 We must go
EXO.8.28	 Pharaoh said, “I will release you

EXO.9.2	 For if you refuse to release them
EXO.9.3	 then the hand of the

EXO.9.5	 The 
EXO.9.6	 And the 
EXO.9.7	 Pharaoh sent representatives to investigate,
EXO.9.8	 Then the 
EXO.9.9	 It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt and will cause boils to break out and fester
EXO.9.10	 So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh, Moses threw it into the air, and it caused festering boils to break out on both people and animals.
EXO.9.11	 The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	 But the 
EXO.9.13	 The 
EXO.9.14	 For this time I will send all my plagues
EXO.9.15	 For by now I could have stretched out

EXO.12.8	 They will eat the meat the same night;
EXO.12.9	 Do not eat it raw
EXO.12.10	 You must leave nothing until morning, but you must burn with fire whatever remains of it until morning. 
EXO.12.11	 This is how you are to eat it – dressed to travel,

EXO.12.19	 For seven days
EXO.12.20	 You will not eat anything made with yeast; in all the places where you live you must eat bread made without yeast.’”
EXO.12.21	 Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel, and told them, “Go and select
EXO.12.22	 Take a branch of hyssop,

EXO.12.26	 When your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’
EXO.12.27	 then you will say, ‘It is the sacrifice

EXO.12.33	 The Egyptians were urging
EXO.12.34	 So the people took their dough before the yeast was added,
EXO.12.35	 Now the Israelites had done
EXO.12.36	 The 
EXO.12.37	 The Israelites journeyed
EXO.12.38	 A mixed multitude
EXO.12.39	 They baked cakes of bread without yeast using the dough they had brought from Egypt, for it was made without yeast – because they were thrust out
EXO.12.40	 Now the length of time the Israelites lived in Egypt was 430 years.
EXO.12.41	 At the end of the 430 years, on the very day, all the regiments
EXO.12.42	 It was a night of vigil for the

EXO.12.44	 But everyone’s servant who is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, may eat it. 
EXO.12.45	 A foreigner and a hired worker must not eat it. 
EXO.12.46	 It must be eaten in one house; you must not bring any of the meat outside the house, and you must not break a bone of it. 
EXO.12.47	 The whole community of Israel must observe it.
EXO.12.48	 “When a foreigner lives
EXO.12.49	 The same law will apply
EXO.12.50	 So all the Israelites did exactly as the

EXO.13.17	 When Pharaoh released
EXO.13.18	 So God brought the people around by the way of the desert to the Red Sea,
EXO.13.19	 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph
EXO.13.20	 They journeyed from Sukkoth and camped in Etham, on the edge of the desert. 
EXO.13.21	 Now the 
EXO.13.22	 He did not remove the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people.
EXO.14.1	 The 
EXO.14.2	 “Tell the Israelites that they must turn and camp

EXO.14.8	 But the 
EXO.14.9	 The Egyptians chased after them, and all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-Zephon. 
EXO.14.10	 When
EXO.14.11	 and they said to Moses, “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the desert?
EXO.14.12	 Isn’t this what we told you
EXO.14.13	 Moses said to the people, “Do not fear!
EXO.14.14	 The 
EXO.14.15	 The 
EXO.14.16	 And as for you,
EXO.14.17	 And as for me, I am going to harden
EXO.14.18	 And the Egyptians will know
EXO.14.19	 The angel of God, who was going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them, and the pillar
EXO.14.20	 It came between the Egyptian camp and the Israelite camp; it was a dark cloud
EXO.14.21	 Moses stretched out his hand toward the sea, and the 
EXO.14.22	 So the Israelites went through the middle of the sea on dry ground, the water forming a wall
EXO.14.23	 The Egyptians chased them and followed them into the middle of the sea – all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
EXO.14.24	 In the morning watch
EXO.14.25	 He jammed
EXO.14.26	 The 
EXO.14.27	 So Moses extended his hand toward the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state
EXO.14.28	 The water returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the army of Pharaoh that was coming after the Israelites into the sea
EXO.14.29	 But the Israelites walked on dry ground in the middle of the sea, the water forming a wall for them on their right and on their left. 
EXO.14.30	 So the 
EXO.14.31	 When Israel saw
EXO.15.1	 Then Moses and the Israelites sang
EXO.15.1	“I will sing

EXO.15.20	 Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a hand-drum in her hand, and all the women went out after her with hand-drums and with dances.
EXO.15.21	 Miriam sang in response
EXO.15.22	 Then Moses led Israel to journey
EXO.15.23	 Then they came to Marah,
EXO.15.24	 So the people murmured
EXO.15.25	 He cried out to the 
EXO.15.26	 He said, “If you will diligently obey
EXO.15.27	 Then they came to Elim,
EXO.16.1	 When
EXO.16.2	 The entire company
EXO.16.3	 The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died
EXO.16.4	 Then the 
EXO.16.5	 On the sixth day
EXO.16.6	 Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening

EXO.16.25	 Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the 
EXO.16.26	 Six days you will gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.” 
EXO.16.27	 On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather it, but they found nothing.

NUM.8.20	 So Moses and Aaron and the entire community of the Israelites did this with the Levites. According to all that the

NUM.10.16	 and over the company of the tribe of the Zebulunites was Elion son of Helon. 
NUM.10.17	 Then the tabernacle was dismantled, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out, carrying the tabernacle.
NUM.10.18	 The standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their companies; over his company was Elizur son of Shedeur. 
NUM.10.19	 Over the company of the tribe of the Simeonites was Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai, 
NUM.10.20	 and over the company of the tribe of the Gadites was Eliasaph son of Deuel. 
NUM.10.21	 And the Kohathites set out, carrying the articles for the sanctuary;

NUM.10.23	 Over the company of the tribe of the Manassehites was Gamaliel son of Pedahzur, 
NUM.10.24	 and over the company of the tribe of Benjaminites was Abidan son of Gideoni.
NUM.10.25	 The standard of the camp of the Danites set out, which was the rear guard

NUM.10.30	 But Hobab
NUM.10.31	 Moses

NUM.11.9	 And when the dew came down
NUM.11.10	 Moses heard the people weeping
NUM.11.11	 And Moses said to the 
NUM.11.12	 Did I conceive this entire people?
NUM.11.13	 From where shall I get
NUM.11.14	 I am not able to bear this entire people alone,

NUM.11.17	 Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take part of the spirit that is on you, and will put it on them, and they will bear some of the burden of the people with you, so that you do not bear it
NUM.11.18	 “And say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves
NUM.11.19	 You will eat, not just one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days, 
NUM.11.20	 but a whole month,

NUM.11.22	 Would they have enough if the flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? If all the fish of the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?” 
NUM.11.23	 And the 
NUM.11.24	 So Moses went out and told the people the words of the 
NUM.11.25	 And the 
NUM.11.26	 But two men remained in the camp; one’s name was Eldad, and the other’s name was Medad. And the spirit rested on them. (Now they were among those in the registration,
NUM.11.27	 And a
NUM.11.28	 Joshua son of Nun, the servant

NUM.11.32	 And the people stayed up
NUM.11.33	 But while the meat was still between their teeth, before they chewed it,
NUM.11.34	 So the name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah,
NUM.11.35	 The people traveled from Kibroth Hattaavah to Hazeroth, and they stayed at Hazeroth.
NUM.12.1	 Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against
NUM.12.2	 They
NUM.12.3	 (Now the man Moses was very humble,
NUM.12.4	 The 
NUM.12.5	 And the 
NUM.12.6	 The

NUM.12.14	 The 
NUM.12.15	 So Miriam was shut outside of the camp for seven days, and the people did not journey on until Miriam was brought back in.
NUM.12.16	 After that the people moved from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM.13.1	 The 
NUM.13.2	 “Send out men to investigate
NUM.13.3	 So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the command
NUM.13.4	 Now these were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur; 
NUM.13.5	 from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;

NUM.13.15	 from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki. 
NUM.13.16	 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to investigate the land. And Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.
NUM.13.17	 When Moses sent
NUM.13.18	 and see
NUM.13.19	 and whether the land they live in is good or bad, and whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or fortified cities, 
NUM.13.20	 and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether or not there are forests in it. And be brave,
NUM.13.21	 So they went up and investigated the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob,
NUM.13.22	 When they went up through the Negev, they
NUM.13.23	 When they came to the valley of Eshcol, they cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a staff
NUM.13.24	 That place was called

NUM.13.26	 They came back

NUM.13.28	 But
NUM.13.29	 The Amalekites live in the land of the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the banks

NUM.21.20	 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the country of Moab, near the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the wilderness.

NUM.21.35	 So they defeated Og,
NUM.22.1	 The Israelites traveled on
NUM.22.2	 Balak son of Zippor saw all that the Israelites had done to the Amorites. 
NUM.22.3	 And the Moabites were greatly afraid of the people, because they were so numerous. The Moabites were sick with fear because of the Israelites.
NUM.22.4	 So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “Now this mass of people

NUM.22.40	 And Balak sacrificed bulls and sheep, and sent some
NUM.22.41	 Then on the next morning Balak took Balaam, and brought him up to Bamoth Baal.
NUM.23.1	 Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” 
NUM.23.2	 So Balak did just as Balaam had said. Balak and Balaam then offered on each
NUM.23.3	 Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself

NUM.23.7	“Balak, the king of Moab, brought me
NUM.23.7	out of the mountains of the east, saying,

NUM.23.13	 Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from which you can observe them. You will see only a part of them, but you will not see all of them. Curse them for me from there.”
NUM.23.14	 So Balak brought Balaam

NUM.23.25	 Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all

NUM.23.27	 Balak said to Balaam, “Come, please; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God

NUM.23.29	 Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars here for me, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams.” 
NUM.23.30	 So Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.24.1	 When Balaam saw that it pleased the 
NUM.24.2	 When Balaam lifted up his eyes, he saw Israel camped tribe by tribe;
NUM.24.3	 Then he uttered this oracle:
NUM.24.3	“The oracle

NUM.24.7	their king will be greater than Agag,
NUM.24.7	and their kingdom will be exalted.
NUM.24.8	 God brought them out of Egypt.
NUM.24.8	They have, as it were, the strength of a young bull;
NUM.24.8	they will devour hostile people
NUM.24.8	and will break their bones
NUM.24.8	and will pierce them through with arrows.
NUM.24.9	 They crouch and lie down like a lion,

NUM.32.24	 So build cities for your descendants and pens for your sheep, but do what you have said
NUM.32.25	 So the Gadites and the Reubenites replied to Moses, “Your servants will do as my lord commands.

NUM.32.27	 but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, to do battle in the

NUM.32.31	 Then the Gadites and the Reubenites answered, “Your servants will do what the

NUM.32.34	 The Gadites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,

DEU.1.7	 Get up now,
DEU.1.8	 Look! I have already given the land to you.
DEU.1.9	 I also said to you at that time, “I am no longer able to sustain you by myself.

DEU.2.34	 At that time we seized all his cities and put every one of them
DEU.2.35	 We kept only the livestock and plunder from the cities for ourselves. 
DEU.2.36	 From Aroer,
DEU.2.37	 However, you did not approach the land of the Ammonites, the Wadi Jabbok,
DEU.3.1	 Next we set out on
DEU.3.2	 The 
DEU.3.3	 So the 
DEU.3.4	 We captured all his cities at that time – there was not a town we did not take from them – sixty cities, all the region of Argob,
DEU.3.5	 All of these cities were fortified by high walls, gates, and locking bars;
DEU.3.6	 We put all of these under divine judgment
DEU.3.7	 But all the livestock and plunder from the cities we kept for ourselves. 
DEU.3.8	 So at that time we took the land of the two Amorite kings in the Transjordan from Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon

DEU.3.12	 This is the land we brought under our control at that time: The territory extending from Aroer
DEU.3.13	 The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh.
DEU.3.14	 Jair, son of Manasseh, took all the Argob region as far as the border with the Geshurites

DEU.3.16	 To the Reubenites and Gadites I allocated the territory extending from Gilead as far as Wadi Arnon (the exact middle of the wadi was a boundary) all the way to the Wadi Jabbok, the Ammonite border. 
DEU.3.17	 The Arabah and the Jordan River
DEU.3.18	 At that time I instructed you as follows: “The 
DEU.3.19	 But your wives, children, and livestock (of which I know you have many) may remain in the cities I have given you. 
DEU.3.20	 You must fight
DEU.3.21	 I also commanded Joshua at the same time, “You have seen everything the 
DEU.3.22	 Do not be afraid of them, for the

DEU.3.24	 “O, Lord

DEU.3.29	 So we settled down in the valley opposite Beth Peor.
DEU.4.1	 Now, Israel, pay attention to the statutes and ordinances
DEU.4.2	 Do not add a thing to what I command you nor subtract from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the

DEU.4.18	 anything that crawls
DEU.4.19	 When you look up
DEU.4.20	 You, however, the 
DEU.4.21	 But the 
DEU.4.22	 So I must die here in this land; I will not cross the Jordan. But you are going over and will possess that
DEU.4.23	 Be on guard so that you do not forget the covenant of the 
DEU.4.24	 For the 
DEU.4.25	 After you have produced children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time,
DEU.4.26	 I invoke heaven and earth as witnesses against you
DEU.4.27	 Then the 
DEU.4.28	 There you will worship gods made by human hands – wood and stone that can neither see, hear, eat, nor smell. 
DEU.4.29	 But if you seek the 
DEU.4.30	 In your distress when all these things happen to you in the latter days,
DEU.4.31	 (for he
DEU.4.32	 Indeed, ask about the distant past, starting from the day God created humankind

DEU.4.39	 Today realize and carefully consider that the 
DEU.4.40	 Keep his statutes and commandments that I am setting forth
DEU.4.41	 Then Moses selected three cities in the Transjordan, toward the east. 
DEU.4.42	 Anyone who accidentally killed someone
DEU.4.43	 These cities are Bezer, in the desert plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassehites.
DEU.4.44	 This is the law that Moses set before the Israelites.
DEU.4.45	 These are the stipulations, statutes, and ordinances that Moses spoke to the Israelites after he had brought them out of Egypt, 
DEU.4.46	 in the Transjordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon. (It is he whom Moses and the Israelites attacked after they came out of Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	 They possessed his land and that of King Og of Bashan – both of whom were Amorite kings in the Transjordan, to the east. 
DEU.4.48	 Their territory extended
DEU.4.49	 including all the Arabah of the Transjordan in the east to the sea of the Arabah,
DEU.5.1	 Then Moses called all the people of Israel together and said to them:
DEU.5.2	 The 
DEU.5.3	 He
DEU.5.4	 The 
DEU.5.5	 (I was standing between the 
DEU.5.6	 “I am the 
DEU.5.7	 You must not have any other gods
DEU.5.8	 You must not make for yourself an image
DEU.5.9	 You must not worship or serve them, for I, the 
DEU.5.10	 but I show covenant faithfulness
DEU.5.11	 You must not make use of the name of the 
DEU.5.12	 Be careful to observe
DEU.5.13	 You are to work and do all your tasks in six days, 
DEU.5.14	 but the seventh day is the Sabbath
DEU.5.15	 Recall that you were slaves in the land of Egypt and that the 
DEU.5.16	 Honor
DEU.5.17	 You must not murder.
DEU.5.18	 You must not commit adultery. 
DEU.5.19	 You must not steal. 
DEU.5.20	 You must not offer false testimony against another.
DEU.5.21	 You must not desire
DEU.5.22	 The 
DEU.5.23	 Then, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness while the mountain was ablaze, all your tribal leaders and elders approached me. 
DEU.5.24	 You said, “The 
DEU.5.25	 But now, why should we die, because this intense fire will consume us! If we keep hearing the voice of the 
DEU.5.26	 Who is there from the entire human race
DEU.5.27	 You go near so that you can hear everything the 
DEU.5.28	 When the 
DEU.5.29	 If only it would really be their desire to fear me and obey
DEU.5.30	 Go and tell them, ‘Return to your tents!’ 
DEU.5.31	 But as for you, remain here with me so I can declare to you all the commandments,
DEU.5.32	 Be careful, therefore, to do exactly what the 
DEU.5.33	 Walk just as he
DEU.6.1	 Now these are the commandments,
DEU.6.2	 and that you may so revere the 
DEU.6.3	 Pay attention, Israel, and be careful to do this so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in number
DEU.6.4	 Listen, Israel: The 
DEU.6.5	 You must love
DEU.6.6	 These words I am commanding you today must be kept in mind, 
DEU.6.7	 and you must teach
DEU.6.8	 You should tie them as a reminder on your forearm
DEU.6.9	 Inscribe them on the doorframes of your houses and gates.
DEU.6.10	 Then when the 
DEU.6.11	 houses filled with choice things you did not accumulate, hewn out cisterns you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant – and you eat your fill, 
DEU.6.12	 be careful not to forget the 
DEU.6.13	 You must revere the 
DEU.6.14	 You must not go after other gods, those
DEU.6.15	 for the 
DEU.6.16	 You must not put the 
DEU.6.17	 Keep his
DEU.6.18	 Do whatever is proper
DEU.6.19	 and that you may drive out all your enemies just as the 
DEU.6.20	 When your children
DEU.6.21	 you must say to them,
DEU.6.22	 And he
DEU.6.23	 He delivered us from there so that he could give us the land he had promised our ancestors. 
DEU.6.24	 The 
DEU.6.25	 We will be innocent if we carefully keep all these commandments
DEU.7.1	 When the 
DEU.7.2	 and he
DEU.7.3	 You must not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons, 
DEU.7.4	 for they will turn your sons away from me to worship other gods. Then the anger of the 
DEU.7.5	 Instead, this is what you must do to them: You must tear down their altars, shatter their sacred pillars,
DEU.7.6	 For you are a people holy
DEU.7.7	 It is not because you were more numerous than all the other peoples that the 
DEU.7.8	 Rather it is because of his
DEU.7.9	 So realize that the 
DEU.7.10	 but who pays back those who hate
DEU.7.11	 So keep the commandments, statutes, and ordinances that I today am commanding you to do.
DEU.7.12	 If you obey these ordinances and are careful to do them, the 
DEU.7.13	 He will love and bless you, and make you numerous. He will bless you with many children,
DEU.7.14	 You will be blessed beyond all peoples; there will be no barrenness
DEU.7.15	 The 
DEU.7.16	 You must destroy
DEU.7.17	 If you think, “These nations are more numerous than I – how can I dispossess them?” 
DEU.7.18	 you must not fear them. You must carefully recall
DEU.7.19	 the great judgments
DEU.7.20	 Furthermore, the 
DEU.7.21	 You must not tremble in their presence, for the 
DEU.7.22	 He,
DEU.7.23	 The 
DEU.7.24	 He will hand over their kings to you and you will erase their very names from memory.
DEU.7.25	 You must burn the images of their gods, but do not covet the silver and gold that covers them so much that you take it for yourself and thus become ensnared by it; for it is abhorrent
DEU.7.26	 You must not bring any abhorrent thing into your house and thereby become an object of divine wrath
DEU.8.1	 You must keep carefully all these commandments
DEU.8.2	 Remember the whole way by which he
DEU.8.3	 So he humbled you by making you hungry and then feeding you with unfamiliar manna.
DEU.8.4	 Your clothing did not wear out nor did your feet swell all these forty years. 
DEU.8.5	 Be keenly aware that just as a parent disciplines his child,
DEU.8.6	 So you must keep his
DEU.8.7	 For the 
DEU.8.8	 a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates, of olive trees and honey, 
DEU.8.9	 a land where you may eat food
DEU.8.10	 You will eat your fill and then praise the 
DEU.8.11	 Be sure you do not forget the 
DEU.8.12	 When you eat your fill, when you build and occupy good houses, 
DEU.8.13	 when your cattle and flocks increase, when you have plenty of silver and gold, and when you have abundance of everything, 
DEU.8.14	 be sure
DEU.8.15	 and who brought you through the great, fearful desert of venomous serpents
DEU.8.16	 fed you in the desert with manna (which your ancestors had never before known) so that he might by humbling you test you
DEU.8.17	 Be careful
DEU.8.18	 You must remember the 
DEU.8.19	 Now if you forget the 
DEU.8.20	 Just like the nations the 
DEU.9.1	 Listen, Israel: Today you are about to cross the Jordan so you can dispossess the nations there, people greater and stronger than you who live in large cities with extremely high fortifications.
DEU.9.2	 They include the Anakites,
DEU.9.3	 Understand today that the 
DEU.9.4	 Do not think to yourself after the 
DEU.9.5	 It is not because of your righteousness, or even your inner uprightness,
DEU.9.6	 Understand, therefore, that it is not because of your righteousness that the 
DEU.9.7	 Remember – don’t ever forget
DEU.9.8	 At Horeb you provoked him and he was angry enough with you to destroy you. 
DEU.9.9	 When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that the 
DEU.9.10	 The 
DEU.9.11	 Now at the end of the forty days and nights the 
DEU.9.12	 And he said to me, “Get up, go down at once from here because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have sinned! They have quickly turned from the way I commanded them and have made for themselves a cast metal image.”
DEU.9.13	 Moreover, he said to me, “I have taken note of these people; they are a stubborn
DEU.9.14	 Stand aside
DEU.9.15	 So I turned and went down the mountain while it
DEU.9.16	 When I looked, you had indeed sinned against the 
DEU.9.17	 I grabbed the two tablets, threw them down,
DEU.9.18	 Then I again fell down before the 
DEU.9.19	 For I was terrified at the 
DEU.9.20	 The 
DEU.9.21	 As for your sinful thing
DEU.9.22	 Moreover, you continued to provoke the 
DEU.9.23	 And when he
DEU.9.24	 You have been rebelling against him
DEU.9.25	 I lay flat on the ground before the 
DEU.9.26	 I prayed to him:
DEU.9.27	 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; ignore the stubbornness, wickedness, and sin of these people. 
DEU.9.28	 Otherwise the people of the land
DEU.9.29	 They are your people, your valued property,
DEU.10.1	 At that same time the 
DEU.10.2	 I will write on the tablets the same words
DEU.10.3	 So I made an ark of acacia
DEU.10.4	 The 
DEU.10.5	 Then I turned, went down the mountain, and placed the tablets into the ark I had made – they are still there, just as the 
DEU.10.6	 “During those days the Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-Yaaqan
DEU.10.7	 From there they traveled to Gudgodah,
DEU.10.8	 At that time the 
DEU.10.9	 Therefore Levi has no allotment or inheritance
DEU.10.10	 As for me, I stayed at the mountain as I did the first time, forty days and nights. The 
DEU.10.11	 Then he
DEU.10.12	 Now, Israel, what does the 
DEU.10.13	 and to keep the Lord’s commandments and statutes that I am giving
DEU.10.14	 The heavens – indeed the highest heavens – belong to the 
DEU.10.15	 However, only to your ancestors did he
DEU.10.16	 Therefore, cleanse
DEU.10.17	 For the 
DEU.10.18	 who justly treats
DEU.10.19	 So you must love the resident foreigner because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	 Revere the 
DEU.10.21	 He is the one you should praise;
DEU.10.22	 When your ancestors went down to Egypt, they numbered only seventy, but now the 
DEU.11.1	 You must love the 
DEU.11.2	 Bear in mind today that I am not speaking
DEU.11.3	 They did not see
DEU.11.4	 or what he did to the army of Egypt, including their horses and chariots, when he made the waters of the Red Sea
DEU.11.5	 They did not see
DEU.11.6	 or what he did to Dathan and Abiram,
DEU.11.7	 I am speaking to you
DEU.11.8	 Now pay attention to all the commandments
DEU.11.9	 and that you may enjoy long life in the land the 
DEU.11.10	 For the land where you are headed
DEU.11.11	 Instead, the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy
DEU.11.12	 a land the 
DEU.11.13	 Now, if you pay close attention
DEU.11.14	 then he promises,
DEU.11.15	 I will provide pasture
DEU.11.16	 Make sure you do not turn away to serve and worship other gods!
DEU.11.17	 Then the anger of the 
DEU.11.18	 Fix these words of mine into your mind and being,
DEU.11.19	 Teach them to your children and speak of them as you sit in your house, as you walk along the road,
DEU.11.20	 Inscribe them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates 
DEU.11.21	 so that your days and those of your descendants may be extended in the land which the 
DEU.11.22	 For if you carefully observe all of these commandments
DEU.11.23	 then he
DEU.11.24	 Every place you set your foot
DEU.11.25	 Nobody will be able to resist you; the 
DEU.11.26	 Take note – I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:
DEU.11.27	 the blessing if you take to heart
DEU.11.28	 and the curse if you pay no attention
DEU.11.29	 When the 
DEU.11.30	 Are they not across the Jordan River,
DEU.11.31	 For you are about to cross the Jordan to possess the land the 
DEU.11.32	 Be certain to keep all the statutes and ordinances that I am presenting to you today.
DEU.12.1	 These are the statutes and ordinances you must be careful to obey as long as you live in the land the 
DEU.12.2	 You must by all means destroy
DEU.12.3	 You must tear down their altars, shatter their sacred pillars,
DEU.12.4	 You must not worship the 
DEU.12.5	 But you must seek only the place he
DEU.12.6	 And there you must take your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the personal offerings you have prepared,
DEU.12.7	 Both you and your families
DEU.12.8	 You must not do like we are doing here today, with everyone
DEU.12.9	 for you have not yet come to the final stop
DEU.12.10	 When you do go across the Jordan River
DEU.12.11	 Then you must come to the place the 
DEU.12.12	 You shall rejoice in the presence of the 
DEU.12.13	 Make sure you do not offer burnt offerings in any place you wish, 
DEU.12.14	 for you may do so
DEU.12.15	 On the other hand, you may slaughter and eat meat as you please when the 
DEU.12.16	 However, you must not eat blood – pour it out on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.17	 You will not be allowed to eat in your villages your tithe of grain, new wine, olive oil, the firstborn of your herd and flock, any votive offerings you have vowed, or your freewill and personal offerings. 
DEU.12.18	 Only in the presence of the 
DEU.12.19	 Be careful not to overlook the Levites as long as you live in the land.
DEU.12.20	 When the 
DEU.12.21	 If the place he
DEU.12.22	 Like you eat the gazelle or ibex, so you may eat these; the ritually impure and pure alike may eat them. 
DEU.12.23	 However, by no means eat the blood, for the blood is life itself
DEU.12.24	 You must not eat it! You must pour it out on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.25	 You must not eat it so that it may go well with you and your children after you; you will be doing what is right in the 
DEU.12.26	 Only the holy things and votive offerings that belong to you, you must pick up and take to the place the 
DEU.12.27	 You must offer your burnt offerings, both meat and blood, on the altar of the 
DEU.12.28	 Pay careful attention to all these things I am commanding you so that it may always go well with you and your children after you when you do what is good and right in the sight of the 
DEU.12.29	 When the 
DEU.12.30	 After they have been destroyed from your presence, be careful not to be ensnared like they are; do not pursue their gods and say, “How do these nations serve their gods? I will do the same.” 
DEU.12.31	 You must not worship the 
DEU.12.32	 (13:1)
DEU.13.1	 Suppose a prophet or one who foretells by dreams
DEU.13.2	 and the sign or wonder should come to pass concerning what he said to you, namely, “Let us follow other gods” – gods whom you have not previously known – “and let us serve them.” 
DEU.13.3	 You must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer,
DEU.13.4	 You must follow the 
DEU.13.5	 As for that prophet or dreamer,
DEU.13.6	 Suppose your own full brother,
DEU.13.7	 the gods of the surrounding people (whether near you or far from you, from one end of the earth
DEU.13.8	 You must not give in to him or even listen to him; do not feel sympathy for him or spare him or cover up for him. 
DEU.13.9	 Instead, you must kill him without fail!
DEU.13.10	 You must stone him to death
DEU.13.11	 Thus all Israel will hear and be afraid; no longer will they continue to do evil like this among you.
DEU.13.12	 Suppose you should hear in one of your cities, which the 
DEU.13.13	 some evil people
DEU.13.14	 You must investigate thoroughly and inquire carefully. If it is indeed true that such a disgraceful thing is being done among you,
DEU.13.15	 you must by all means
DEU.13.16	 You must gather all of its plunder into the middle of the plaza
DEU.13.17	 You must not take for yourself anything that has been placed under judgment.
DEU.13.18	 Thus you must obey the 
DEU.14.1	 You are children
DEU.14.2	 For you are a people holy
DEU.14.3	 You must not eat any forbidden
DEU.14.4	 These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, 
DEU.14.5	 the ibex,
DEU.14.6	 You may eat any animal that has hooves divided into two parts and that chews the cud.
DEU.14.7	 However, you may not eat the following animals among those that chew the cud or those that have divided hooves: the camel, the hare, and the rock badger.
DEU.14.8	 Also the pig is ritually impure to you; though it has divided hooves,
DEU.14.9	 These you may eat from among water creatures: anything with fins and scales you may eat, 
DEU.14.10	 but whatever does not have fins and scales you may not eat; it is ritually impure to you. 
DEU.14.11	 All ritually clean birds you may eat. 
DEU.14.12	 These are the ones you may not eat: the eagle,
DEU.14.13	 the kite, the black kite, the dayyah
DEU.14.14	 every raven after its species, 
DEU.14.15	 the ostrich,
DEU.14.16	 the little owl, the long-eared owl, the white owl,
DEU.14.17	 the jackdaw,
DEU.14.18	 the stork, the heron after its species, the hoopoe, the bat, 
DEU.14.19	 and any winged thing on the ground are impure to you – they may not be eaten.
DEU.14.20	 You may eat any clean bird. 
DEU.14.21	 You may not eat any corpse, though you may give it to the resident foreigner who is living in your villages
DEU.14.22	 You must be certain to tithe
DEU.14.23	 In the presence of the 
DEU.14.24	 When he
DEU.14.25	 you may convert the tithe into money, secure the money,
DEU.14.26	 Then you may spend the money however you wish for cattle, sheep, wine, beer, or whatever you desire. You and your household may eat there in the presence of the 
DEU.14.27	 As for the Levites in your villages, you must not ignore them, for they have no allotment or inheritance along with you. 
DEU.14.28	 At the end of every three years you must bring all the tithe of your produce, in that very year, and you must store it up in your villages. 
DEU.14.29	 Then the Levites (because they have no allotment or inheritance with you), the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows of your villages may come and eat their fill so that the 
DEU.15.1	 At the end of every seven years you must declare a cancellation
DEU.15.2	 This is the nature of the cancellation: Every creditor must remit what he has loaned to another person;
DEU.15.3	 You may exact payment from a foreigner, but whatever your fellow Israelite
DEU.15.4	 However, there should not be any poor among you, for the 
DEU.15.5	 if you carefully obey
DEU.15.6	 For the 
DEU.15.7	 If a fellow Israelite
DEU.15.8	 Instead, you must be sure to open your hand to him and generously lend
DEU.15.9	 Be careful lest you entertain the wicked thought that the seventh year, the year of cancellation of debts, has almost arrived, and your attitude
DEU.15.10	 You must by all means lend
DEU.15.11	 There will never cease to be some poor people in the land; therefore, I am commanding you to make sure you open
DEU.15.12	 If your fellow Hebrew
DEU.15.13	 If you set them free, you must not send them away empty-handed. 
DEU.15.14	 You must supply them generously
DEU.15.15	 Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and the 
DEU.15.16	 However, if the servant
DEU.15.17	 you shall take an awl and pierce a hole through his ear to the door.
DEU.15.18	 You should not consider it difficult to let him go free, for he will have served you for six years, twice
DEU.15.19	 You must set apart
DEU.15.20	 You and your household must eat them annually before the 
DEU.15.21	 If they have any kind of blemish – lameness, blindness, or anything else
DEU.15.22	 You may eat it in your villages,
DEU.15.23	 However, you must not eat its blood; you must pour it out on the ground like water.
DEU.16.1	 Observe the month Abib
DEU.16.2	 You must sacrifice the Passover animal
DEU.16.3	 You must not eat any yeast with it; for seven days you must eat bread made without yeast, symbolic of affliction, for you came out of Egypt hurriedly. You must do this so you will remember for the rest of your life the day you came out of the land of Egypt. 
DEU.16.4	 There must not be a scrap of yeast within your land
DEU.16.5	 You may not sacrifice the Passover in just any of your villages
DEU.16.6	 but you must sacrifice it
DEU.16.7	 You must cook
DEU.16.8	 You must eat bread made without yeast for six days. The seventh day you are to hold an assembly for the 
DEU.16.9	 You must count seven weeks; you must begin to count them
DEU.16.10	 Then you are to celebrate the Festival of Weeks
DEU.16.11	 You shall rejoice before him
DEU.16.12	 Furthermore, remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and so be careful to observe these statutes.
DEU.16.13	 You must celebrate the Festival of Temporary Shelters
DEU.16.14	 You are to rejoice in your festival, you, your son, your daughter, your male and female slaves, the Levites, the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows who are in your villages.
DEU.16.15	 You are to celebrate the festival seven days before the 
DEU.16.16	 Three times a year all your males must appear before the 
DEU.16.17	 Every one of you must give as you are able,
DEU.16.18	 You must appoint judges and civil servants
DEU.16.19	 You must not pervert justice or show favor. Do not take a bribe, for bribes blind the eyes of the wise and distort
DEU.16.20	 You must pursue justice alone
DEU.16.21	 You must not plant any kind of tree as a sacred Asherah pole
DEU.16.22	 You must not erect a sacred pillar,
DEU.17.1	 You must not sacrifice to him
DEU.17.2	 Suppose a man or woman is discovered among you – in one of your villages
DEU.17.3	 by serving other gods and worshiping them – the sun,
DEU.17.4	 When it is reported to you and you hear about it, you must investigate carefully. If it is indeed true that such a disgraceful thing
DEU.17.5	 you must bring to your city gates
DEU.17.6	 At the testimony of two or three witnesses they must be executed. They cannot be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. 
DEU.17.7	 The witnesses
DEU.17.8	 If a matter is too difficult for you to judge – bloodshed,
DEU.17.9	 You will go to the Levitical priests and the judge in office in those days and seek a solution; they will render a verdict. 
DEU.17.10	 You must then do as they have determined at that place the 
DEU.17.11	 You must do what you are instructed, and the verdict they pronounce to you, without fail. Do not deviate right or left from what they tell you. 
DEU.17.12	 The person who pays no attention
DEU.17.13	 Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and not be so presumptuous again.
DEU.17.14	 When you come to the land the 
DEU.17.15	 you must select without fail
DEU.17.16	 Moreover, he must not accumulate horses for himself or allow the people to return to Egypt to do so,
DEU.17.17	 Furthermore, he must not marry many
DEU.17.18	 When he sits on his royal throne he must make a copy of this law
DEU.17.19	 It must be with him constantly and he must read it as long as he lives, so that he may learn to revere the 
DEU.17.20	 Then he will not exalt himself above his fellow citizens or turn from the commandments to the right or left, and he and his descendants will enjoy many years ruling over his kingdom
DEU.18.1	 The Levitical priests
DEU.18.2	 They
DEU.18.3	 This shall be the priests’ fair allotment
DEU.18.4	 You must give them the best of your
DEU.18.5	 For the 
DEU.18.6	 Suppose a Levite comes by his own free will
DEU.18.7	 and serves in the name of the 
DEU.18.8	 He must eat the same share they do, despite any profits he may gain from the sale of his family’s inheritance.
DEU.18.9	 When you enter the land the 
DEU.18.10	 There must never be found among you anyone who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire,
DEU.18.11	 one who casts spells,
DEU.18.12	 Whoever does these things is abhorrent to the 
DEU.18.13	 You must be blameless before the 
DEU.18.14	 Those nations that you are about to dispossess listen to omen readers and diviners, but the 
DEU.18.15	 The 
DEU.18.16	 This accords with what happened at Horeb in the day of the assembly. You asked the 
DEU.18.17	 The 
DEU.18.18	 I will raise up a prophet like you for them from among their fellow Israelites. I will put my words in his mouth and he will speak to them whatever I command. 
DEU.18.19	 I will personally hold responsible
DEU.18.20	 “But if any prophet presumes to speak anything in my name that I have not authorized
DEU.18.21	 Now if you say to yourselves,
DEU.18.22	 whenever a prophet speaks in my
DEU.19.1	 When the 
DEU.19.2	 you must set apart for yourselves three cities
DEU.19.3	 You shall build a roadway and divide into thirds the whole extent
DEU.19.4	 Now this is the law pertaining to one who flees there in order to live,
DEU.19.5	 Suppose he goes with someone else
DEU.19.6	 Otherwise the blood avenger will chase after the killer in the heat of his anger, eventually overtake him,
DEU.19.7	 Therefore, I am commanding you to set apart for yourselves three cities. 
DEU.19.8	 If the 
DEU.19.9	 and then you are careful to observe all these commandments
DEU.19.10	 You must not shed innocent blood
DEU.19.11	 However, suppose a person hates someone else
DEU.19.12	 The elders of his own city must send for him and remove him from there to deliver him over to the blood avenger
DEU.19.13	 You must not pity him, but purge out the blood of the innocent
DEU.19.14	 You must not encroach on your neighbor’s property,
DEU.19.15	 A single witness may not testify
DEU.19.16	 If a false
DEU.19.17	 then both parties to the controversy must stand before the 
DEU.19.18	 The judges will thoroughly investigate the matter, and if the witness should prove to be false and to have given false testimony against the accused,
DEU.19.19	 you must do to him what he had intended to do to the accused. In this way you will purge
DEU.19.20	 The rest of the people will hear and become afraid to keep doing such evil among you. 
DEU.19.21	 You must not show pity; the principle will be a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, and a foot for a foot.
DEU.20.1	 When you go to war against your enemies and see chariotry
DEU.20.2	 As you move forward for battle, the priest
DEU.20.3	 “Listen, Israel! Today you are moving forward to do battle with your enemies. Do not be fainthearted. Do not fear and tremble or be terrified because of them, 
DEU.20.4	 for the 
DEU.20.5	 Moreover, the officers are to say to the troops,
DEU.20.6	 Or who among you has planted a vineyard and not benefited from it? He may go home, lest he die in battle and someone else benefit from it. 
DEU.20.7	 Or who among you
DEU.20.8	 In addition, the officers are to say to the troops, “Who among you is afraid and fainthearted? He may go home so that he will not make his fellow soldier’s
DEU.20.9	 Then, when the officers have finished speaking,
DEU.20.10	 When you approach a city to wage war against it, offer it terms of peace. 
DEU.20.11	 If it accepts your terms
DEU.20.12	 If it does not accept terms of peace but makes war with you, then you are to lay siege to it. 
DEU.20.13	 The 
DEU.20.14	 However, the women, little children, cattle, and anything else in the city – all its plunder – you may take for yourselves as spoil. You may take from your enemies the plunder that the 
DEU.20.15	 This is how you are to deal with all those cities located far from you, those that do not belong to these nearby nations.
DEU.20.16	 As for the cities of these peoples that
DEU.20.17	 Instead you must utterly annihilate them
DEU.20.18	 so that they cannot teach you all the abhorrent ways they worship
DEU.20.19	 If you besiege a city for a long time while attempting to capture it,
DEU.20.20	 However, you may chop down any tree you know is not suitable for food,
DEU.21.1	 If a homicide victim
DEU.21.2	 your elders and judges must go out and measure how far it is to the cities in the vicinity of the corpse.
DEU.21.3	 Then the elders of the city nearest to the corpse
DEU.21.4	 and bring the heifer down to a wadi with flowing water,
DEU.21.5	 Then the Levitical priests
DEU.21.6	 and all the elders of that city nearest the corpse
DEU.21.7	 Then they must proclaim, “Our hands have not spilled this blood, nor have we
DEU.21.8	 Do not blame
DEU.21.9	 In this manner you will purge out the guilt of innocent blood from among you, for you must do what is right before
DEU.21.10	 When you go out to do battle with your enemies and the 
DEU.21.11	 if you should see among them
DEU.21.12	 you may bring her back to your house. She must shave her head,
DEU.21.13	 discard the clothing she was wearing when captured,
DEU.21.14	 If you are not pleased with her, then you must let her go
DEU.21.15	 Suppose a man has two wives, one whom he loves more than the other,
DEU.21.16	 In the day he divides his inheritance
DEU.21.17	 Rather, he must acknowledge the son of the less loved
DEU.21.18	 If a person has a stubborn, rebellious son who pays no attention to his father or mother, and they discipline him to no avail,
DEU.21.19	 his father and mother must seize him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his city. 
DEU.21.20	 They must declare to the elders
DEU.21.21	 Then all the men of his city must stone him to death. In this way you will purge out
DEU.21.22	 If a person commits a sin punishable by death and is executed, and you hang the corpse
DEU.21.23	 his body must not remain all night on the tree; instead you must make certain you bury
DEU.22.1	 When you see
DEU.22.2	 If the owner
DEU.22.3	 You shall do the same to his donkey, his clothes, or anything else your neighbor
DEU.22.4	 When you see
DEU.22.5	 A woman must not wear men’s clothing,
DEU.22.6	 If you happen to notice a bird’s nest along the road, whether in a tree or on the ground, and there are chicks or eggs with the mother bird sitting on them,
DEU.22.7	 You must be sure
DEU.22.8	 If you build a new house, you must construct a guard rail
DEU.22.9	 You must not plant your vineyard with two kinds of seed; otherwise the entire yield, both of the seed you plant and the produce of the vineyard, will be defiled.
DEU.22.10	 You must not plow with an ox and a donkey harnessed together. 
DEU.22.11	 You must not wear clothing made with wool and linen meshed together.
DEU.22.12	 You shall make yourselves tassels
DEU.22.13	 Suppose a man marries a woman, has sexual relations with her,
DEU.22.14	 accusing her of impropriety
DEU.22.15	 Then the father and mother of the young woman must produce the evidence of virginity
DEU.22.16	 The young woman’s father must say to the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man and he has rejected
DEU.22.17	 Moreover, he has raised accusations of impropriety by saying, ‘I discovered your daughter was not a virgin,’ but this is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity!” The cloth must then be spread out
DEU.22.18	 The elders of that city must then seize the man and punish
DEU.22.19	 They will fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them to the young woman’s father, for the man who made the accusation
DEU.22.20	 But if the accusation is true and the young woman was not a virgin, 
DEU.22.21	 the men of her city must bring the young woman to the door of her father’s house and stone her to death, for she has done a disgraceful thing
DEU.22.22	 If a man is caught having sexual relations with
DEU.22.23	 If a virgin is engaged to a man and another man meets
DEU.22.24	 you must bring the two of them to the gate of that city and stone them to death, the young woman because she did not cry out though in the city and the man because he violated
DEU.22.25	 But if the man came across
DEU.22.26	 You must not do anything to the young woman – she has done nothing deserving of death. This case is the same as when someone attacks another person
DEU.22.27	 for the man
DEU.22.28	 Suppose a man comes across a virgin who is not engaged and overpowers and rapes
DEU.22.29	 The man who has raped her must pay her father fifty shekels of silver and she must become his wife because he has violated her; he may never divorce her as long as he lives.

DEU.23.1	 A man with crushed
DEU.23.2	 A person of illegitimate birth
DEU.23.3	 An Ammonite or Moabite
DEU.23.4	 for they did not meet you with food and water on the way as you came from Egypt, and furthermore, they hired
DEU.23.5	 But the 
DEU.23.6	 You must not seek peace and prosperity for them through all the ages to come. 
DEU.23.7	 You must not hate an Edomite, for he is your relative;
DEU.23.8	 Children of the third generation born to them
DEU.23.9	 When you go out as an army against your enemies, guard yourselves against anything impure.
DEU.23.10	 If there is someone among you who is impure because of some nocturnal emission,
DEU.23.11	 When evening arrives he must wash himself with water and then at sunset he may reenter the camp.
DEU.23.12	 You are to have a place outside the camp to serve as a latrine.
DEU.23.13	 You must have a spade among your other equipment and when you relieve yourself
DEU.23.14	 For the 
DEU.23.15	 You must not return an escaped slave to his master when he has run away to you.
DEU.23.16	 Indeed, he may live among you in any place he chooses, in whichever of your villages
DEU.23.17	 There must never be a sacred prostitute
DEU.23.18	 You must never bring the pay of a female prostitute
DEU.23.19	 You must not charge interest on a loan to your fellow Israelite,
DEU.23.20	 You may lend with interest to a foreigner, but not to your fellow Israelite; if you keep this command the 
DEU.23.21	 When you make a vow to the 
DEU.23.22	 If you refrain from making a vow, it will not be sinful. 
DEU.23.23	 Whatever you vow, you must be careful to do what you have promised, such as what you have vowed to the 
DEU.23.24	 When you enter the vineyard of your neighbor you may eat as many grapes as you please,
DEU.23.25	 When you go into the ripe grain fields of your neighbor you may pluck off the kernels with your hand,
DEU.24.1	 If a man marries a woman and she does not please him because he has found something offensive
DEU.24.2	 When she has left him
DEU.24.3	 If the second husband rejects
DEU.24.4	 her first husband who divorced her is not permitted to remarry
DEU.24.5	 When a man is newly married, he need not go into
DEU.24.6	 One must not take either lower or upper millstones as security on a loan, for that is like taking a life itself as security.
DEU.24.7	 If a man is found kidnapping a person from among his fellow Israelites,
DEU.24.8	 Be careful during an outbreak of leprosy to follow precisely
DEU.24.9	 Remember what the 
DEU.24.10	 When you make any kind of loan to your neighbor, you may not go into his house to claim what he is offering as security.
DEU.24.11	 You must stand outside and the person to whom you are making the loan will bring out to you what he is offering as security.
DEU.24.12	 If the person is poor you may not use what he gives you as security for a covering.
DEU.24.13	 You must by all means
DEU.24.14	 You must not oppress a lowly and poor servant, whether one from among your fellow Israelites
DEU.24.15	 You must pay his wage that very day before the sun sets, for he is poor and his life depends on it. Otherwise he will cry out to the 
DEU.24.16	 Fathers must not be put to death for what their children
DEU.24.17	 You must not pervert justice due a resident foreigner or an orphan, or take a widow’s garment as security for a loan. 
DEU.24.18	 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the 
DEU.24.19	 Whenever you reap your harvest in your field and leave some unraked grain there,
DEU.24.20	 When you beat your olive tree you must not repeat the procedure;
DEU.24.21	 When you gather the grapes of your vineyard you must not do so a second time;
DEU.24.22	 Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt; therefore, I am commanding you to do all this.
DEU.25.1	 If controversy arises between people,
DEU.25.2	 Then,
DEU.25.3	 The judge
DEU.25.4	 You must not muzzle your
DEU.25.5	 If brothers live together and one of them dies without having a son, the dead man’s wife must not remarry someone outside the family. Instead, her late husband’s brother must go to her, marry her,
DEU.25.6	 Then
DEU.25.7	 But if the man does not want to marry his brother’s widow, then she
DEU.25.8	 Then the elders of his city must summon him and speak to him. If he persists, saying, “I don’t want to marry her,” 
DEU.25.9	 then his sister-in-law must approach him in view of the elders, remove his sandal from his foot, and spit in his face.
DEU.25.10	 His family name will be referred to
DEU.25.11	 If two men
DEU.25.12	 then you must cut off her hand – do not pity her.
DEU.25.13	 You must not have in your bag different stone weights,
DEU.25.14	 You must not have in your house different measuring containers,
DEU.25.15	 You must have an accurate and correct
DEU.25.16	 For anyone who acts dishonestly in these ways is abhorrent
DEU.25.17	 Remember what the Amalekites
DEU.25.18	 how they met you along the way and cut off all your stragglers in the rear of the march when you were exhausted and tired; they were unafraid of God.
DEU.25.19	 So when the 
DEU.26.1	 When
DEU.26.2	 you must take the first of all the ground’s produce you harvest from the land the 
DEU.26.3	 You must go to the priest in office at that time and say to him, “I declare today to the 
DEU.26.4	 The priest will then take the basket from you
DEU.26.5	 Then you must affirm before the 
DEU.26.6	 But the Egyptians mistreated and oppressed us, forcing us to do burdensome labor. 
DEU.26.7	 So we cried out to the 
DEU.26.8	 Therefore the 
DEU.26.9	 Then he brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
DEU.26.10	 So now, look! I have brought the first of the ground’s produce that you, 
DEU.26.11	 You will celebrate all the good things that the 
DEU.26.12	 When you finish tithing all
DEU.26.13	 Then you shall say before the 
DEU.26.14	 I have not eaten anything when I was in mourning, or removed any of it while ceremonially unclean, or offered any of it to the dead;
DEU.26.15	 Look down from your holy dwelling place in heaven and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us, just as you promised our ancestors – a land flowing with milk and honey.”
DEU.26.16	 Today the 
DEU.26.17	 Today you have declared the 
DEU.26.18	 And today the 
DEU.26.19	 Then
DEU.27.1	 Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: “Pay attention to all the commandments
DEU.27.2	 When you cross the Jordan River
DEU.27.3	 Then you must inscribe on them all the words of this law when you cross over, so that you may enter the land the 
DEU.27.4	 So when you cross the Jordan you must erect on Mount Ebal
DEU.27.5	 Then you must build an altar there to the 
DEU.27.6	 You must build the altar of the 
DEU.27.7	 Also you must offer fellowship offerings and eat them there, rejoicing before the 
DEU.27.8	 You must inscribe on the stones all the words of this law, making them clear.”
DEU.27.9	 Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel: “Be quiet and pay attention, Israel. Today you have become the people of the 
DEU.27.10	 You must obey him
DEU.27.11	 Moreover, Moses commanded the people that day: 
DEU.27.12	 “The following tribes
DEU.27.13	 And these other tribes must stand for the curse on Mount Ebal: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
DEU.27.14	 “The Levites will call out to every Israelite
DEU.27.15	 ‘Cursed is the one
DEU.27.16	 ‘Cursed

DEU.27.18	 ‘Cursed is the one who misleads a blind person on the road.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’ 
DEU.27.19	 ‘Cursed is the one who perverts justice for the resident foreigner, the orphan, and the widow.’ Then all the people will say, ‘Amen!’ 
DEU.27.20	 ‘Cursed is the one who has sexual relations with
DEU.27.21	 ‘Cursed is the one who commits bestiality.’

DEU.28.1	 “If you indeed

DEU.31.14	 Then the 
DEU.31.15	 The 
DEU.31.16	 Then the 
DEU.31.17	 At that time
DEU.31.18	 But I will certainly
DEU.31.19	 Now write down for yourselves the following song and teach it to the Israelites. Put it into their very mouths so that this song may serve as my witness against the Israelites! 
DEU.31.20	 For after I have brought them
DEU.31.21	 Then when
DEU.31.22	 So on that day Moses wrote down this song and taught it to the Israelites, 
DEU.31.23	 and the 
DEU.31.24	 When Moses finished writing on a scroll the words of this law in their entirety, 
DEU.31.25	 he
DEU.31.26	 “Take this scroll of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.27	 for I know about your rebellion and stubbornness.
DEU.31.28	 Gather to me all your tribal elders and officials so I can speak to them directly about these things and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them. 
DEU.31.29	 For I know that after I die you will totally
DEU.31.30	 Then Moses recited the words of this song from start to finish in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel.
DEU.32.1	 Listen, O heavens, and I will speak;
DEU.32.1	hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
DEU.32.2	 My teaching will drop like the rain,
DEU.32.2	my sayings will drip like the dew,
DEU.32.2	as rain drops upon the grass,
DEU.32.2	and showers upon new growth.
DEU.32.3	 For I will proclaim the name
DEU.32.3	you must acknowledge the greatness of our God.
DEU.32.4	 As for the Rock,
DEU.32.4	for all his ways are just.
DEU.32.4	He is a reliable God who is never unjust,
DEU.32.4	he is fair
DEU.32.5	 His people have been unfaithful
DEU.32.5	they have not acted like his children
DEU.32.5	They are a perverse
DEU.32.6	 Is this how you repay
DEU.32.6	you foolish, unwise people?
DEU.32.6	Is he not your father, your creator?
DEU.32.6	He has made you and established you.
DEU.32.7	 Remember the ancient days;
DEU.32.7	bear in mind
DEU.32.7	Ask your father and he will inform you,
DEU.32.7	your elders, and they will tell you.
DEU.32.8	 When the Most High
DEU.32.8	when he divided up humankind,
DEU.32.8	he set the boundaries of the peoples,
DEU.32.8	according to the number of the heavenly assembly.
DEU.32.9	 For the 
DEU.32.9	Jacob is his special possession.
DEU.32.10	 The 
DEU.32.10	in an empty wasteland where animals howl.
DEU.32.10	He continually guarded him
DEU.32.10	he continually protected him
DEU.32.11	 Like an eagle that stirs up
DEU.32.11	that hovers over its young,
DEU.32.11	so the 
DEU.32.11	he lifted him up on his pinions.
DEU.32.12	 The 
DEU.32.12	no foreign god was with him.
DEU.32.13	 He enabled him
DEU.32.13	and he ate of the produce of the fields.
DEU.32.13	He provided honey for him from the cliffs,
DEU.32.13	and olive oil
DEU.32.14	 butter from the herd
DEU.32.14	and milk from the flock,
DEU.32.14	along with the fat of lambs,
DEU.32.14	rams and goats of Bashan,
DEU.32.14	along with the best of the kernels of wheat;
DEU.32.14	and from the juice of grapes you drank wine.
DEU.32.15	 But Jeshurun
DEU.32.15	you
DEU.32.15	Then he deserted the God who made him,
DEU.32.15	and treated the Rock who saved him with contempt.
DEU.32.16	 They made him jealous with other gods,
DEU.32.16	they enraged him with abhorrent idols.
DEU.32.17	 They sacrificed to demons, not God,
DEU.32.17	to gods they had not known;
DEU.32.17	to new gods who had recently come along,
DEU.32.17	gods your ancestors
DEU.32.18	 You have forgotten
DEU.32.18	and put out of mind the God who gave you birth.
DEU.32.19	 But the 
DEU.32.19	because his sons and daughters enraged him.
DEU.32.20	 He said, “I will reject them,
DEU.32.20	I will see what will happen to them;
DEU.32.20	for they are a perverse generation,
DEU.32.20	children
DEU.32.21	 They have made me jealous
DEU.32.21	enraging me with their worthless gods;
DEU.32.21	so I will make them jealous with a people they do not recognize,
DEU.32.21	with a nation slow to learn
DEU.32.22	 For a fire has been kindled by my anger,
DEU.32.22	and it burns to lowest Sheol;
DEU.32.22	it consumes the earth and its produce,
DEU.32.22	and ignites the foundations of the mountains.
DEU.32.23	 I will increase their
DEU.32.23	I will use up my arrows on them.
DEU.32.24	 They will be starved by famine,
DEU.32.24	eaten by plague, and bitterly stung;
DEU.32.24	I will send the teeth of wild animals against them,
DEU.32.24	along with the poison of creatures that crawl in the dust.
DEU.32.25	 The sword will make people childless outside,
DEU.32.25	and terror will do so inside;
DEU.32.25	they will destroy
DEU.32.25	the infant and the gray-haired man.
DEU.32.26	 “I said, ‘I want to cut them in pieces.
DEU.32.26	I want to make people forget they ever existed.
DEU.32.27	 But I fear the reaction
DEU.32.27	for

DEU.32.27	and the 
DEU.32.28	 They are a nation devoid of wisdom, 
DEU.32.28	and there is no understanding among them.
DEU.32.29	 I wish that they were wise and could understand this,
DEU.32.29	and that they could comprehend what will happen to them.”
DEU.32.30	 How can one man chase a thousand of them,
DEU.32.30	and two pursue ten thousand;
DEU.32.30	unless their Rock had delivered them up,
DEU.32.30	and the 
DEU.32.31	 For our enemies’
DEU.32.31	as even our enemies concede.
DEU.32.32	 For their vine is from the stock
DEU.32.32	and from the fields of Gomorrah.
DEU.32.32	Their grapes contain venom, 
DEU.32.32	their clusters of grapes are bitter.
DEU.32.33	 Their wine is snakes’ poison,
DEU.32.33	the deadly venom of cobras.
DEU.32.34	 “Is this not stored up with me?” says the 
DEU.32.34	“Is it not sealed up in my storehouses?
DEU.32.35	 I will get revenge and pay them back
DEU.32.35	at the time their foot slips;

DEU.32.36	and that no one is left, whether confined or set free.
DEU.32.37	 He will say, “Where are their gods,
DEU.32.37	the rock in whom they sought security,
DEU.32.38	 who ate the best of their sacrifices,
DEU.32.38	and drank the wine of their drink offerings?
DEU.32.38	Let them rise and help you;
DEU.32.38	let them be your refuge!
DEU.32.39	 “See now that I, indeed I, am he!” says the 
DEU.32.39	“and there is no other god besides me.
DEU.32.39	I kill and give life,
DEU.32.39	I smash and I heal,
DEU.32.39	and none can resist
DEU.32.40	 For I raise up my hand to heaven,
DEU.32.40	and say, ‘As surely as I live forever,
DEU.32.41	 I will sharpen my lightning-like sword,
DEU.32.41	and my hand will grasp hold of the weapon of judgment;
DEU.32.41	I will execute vengeance on my foes,
DEU.32.41	and repay those who hate me!
DEU.32.42	 I will make my arrows drunk with blood, 
DEU.32.42	and my sword will devour flesh – 
DEU.32.42	the blood of the slaughtered and captured,
DEU.32.42	the chief

DEU.32.43	for he will avenge his servants’ blood;
DEU.32.43	he will take vengeance against his enemies,
DEU.32.43	and make atonement for his land and people.
DEU.32.44	 Then Moses went with Joshua
DEU.32.45	 When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel 
DEU.32.46	 he said to them, “Keep in mind all the words I am solemnly proclaiming to you today; you must command your children to observe carefully all the words of this law. 
DEU.32.47	 For this is no idle word for you – it is your life! By this word you will live a long time in the land you are about to cross the Jordan to possess.”
DEU.32.48	 Then the 
DEU.32.49	 “Go up to this Abarim
DEU.32.50	 You will die
DEU.32.51	 for both of you
DEU.32.52	 You will see the land before you, but you will not enter the land that I am giving to the Israelites.”
DEU.33.1	 This is the blessing Moses the man of God pronounced upon the Israelites before his death. 
DEU.33.2	 He said:
DEU.33.2	The 
DEU.33.2	and revealed himself
DEU.33.2	He appeared in splendor
DEU.33.2	and came forth with ten thousand holy ones.
DEU.33.2	With his right hand he gave a fiery law
DEU.33.3	 Surely he loves the people;
DEU.33.3	all your holy ones
DEU.33.3	And they sit
DEU.33.3	each receiving
DEU.33.4	 Moses delivered to us a law,
DEU.33.4	an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
DEU.33.5	 The 
DEU.33.5	when the leaders of the people assembled,
DEU.33.5	the tribes of Israel together.
DEU.33.6	 May Reuben live and not die,
DEU.33.6	and may his people multiply.
DEU.33.7	 And this is the blessing
DEU.33.7	Listen, O 
DEU.33.7	and bring him to his people.
DEU.33.7	May his power be great,
DEU.33.7	and may you help him against his foes.
DEU.33.8	 Of Levi he said:
DEU.33.8	Your Thummim and Urim
DEU.33.8	whose authority you challenged at Massah,
DEU.33.8	and with whom you argued at the waters of Meribah.
DEU.33.9	 He said to his father and mother, “I have not seen him,”
DEU.33.9	and he did not acknowledge his own brothers
DEU.33.9	or know his own children,
DEU.33.9	for they kept your word,
DEU.33.9	and guarded your covenant.
DEU.33.10	 They will teach Jacob your ordinances
DEU.33.10	and Israel your law;
DEU.33.10	they will offer incense as a pleasant odor, 
DEU.33.10	and a whole offering on your altar.

DEU.33.11	and be pleased with his efforts;
DEU.33.11	undercut the legs
DEU.33.11	and of those who hate him, so that they cannot stand.
DEU.33.12	 Of Benjamin he said:
DEU.33.12	The beloved of the 
DEU.33.12	he protects him all the time, 
DEU.33.12	and the 
DEU.33.13	 Of Joseph he said:

DEU.33.15	and the harvest produced by the age-old hills;
DEU.33.16	 with the harvest of the earth and its fullness
DEU.33.16	and the pleasure of him who resided in the burning bush.
DEU.33.16	May blessing rest on Joseph’s head,
DEU.33.16	and on the top of the head of the one set apart
DEU.33.17	 May the firstborn of his bull bring him honor,
DEU.33.17	and may his horns be those of a wild ox;
DEU.33.17	with them may he gore all peoples,
DEU.33.17	all the far reaches of the earth.
DEU.33.17	They are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
DEU.33.17	and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
DEU.33.18	 Of Zebulun he said:
DEU.33.18	Rejoice, Zebulun, when you go outside, 
DEU.33.18	and Issachar, when you are in your tents.
DEU.33.19	 They will summon peoples to the mountain,
DEU.33.19	there they will sacrifice proper
DEU.33.19	for they will enjoy
DEU.33.19	and the hidden treasures of the shores.
DEU.33.20	 Of Gad he said:
DEU.33.20	Blessed be the one who enlarges Gad.
DEU.33.20	Like a lioness he will dwell;
DEU.33.20	he will tear at an arm – indeed, a scalp.
DEU.33.21	 He has selected the best part for himself,
DEU.33.21	for the portion of the ruler
DEU.33.21	he came with the leaders
DEU.33.21	he obeyed the righteous laws of the 
DEU.33.21	and his ordinances with Israel.
DEU.33.22	 Of Dan he said:
DEU.33.22	Dan is a lion’s cub;
DEU.33.22	he will leap forth from Bashan.
DEU.33.23	 Of Naphtali he said:
DEU.33.23	O Naphtali, overflowing with favor,
DEU.33.23	and full of the 
DEU.33.23	possess the west and south.
DEU.33.24	 Of Asher he said:
DEU.33.24	Asher is blessed with children,
DEU.33.24	may he be favored by his brothers
DEU.33.24	and may he dip his foot in olive oil.
DEU.33.25	 The bars of your gates
DEU.33.25	and may you have lifelong strength.
DEU.33.26	 There is no one like God, O Jeshurun,
DEU.33.26	who rides through the sky
DEU.33.26	on the clouds in majesty.
DEU.33.27	 The everlasting God is a refuge, 
DEU.33.27	and underneath you are his eternal arms;
DEU.33.27	he has driven out enemies before you,
DEU.33.27	and has said, “Destroy!”
DEU.33.28	 Israel lives in safety,
DEU.33.28	the fountain of Jacob is quite secure,
DEU.33.28	in a land of grain and new wine;
DEU.33.28	indeed, its heavens
DEU.33.29	 You have joy, Israel! Who is like you?
DEU.33.29	You are a people delivered by the 
DEU.33.29	your protective shield
DEU.33.29	and your exalted sword.
DEU.33.29	May your enemies cringe before you;
DEU.33.29	may you trample on their backs.
DEU.34.1	 Then Moses ascended from the deserts of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the summit of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho.
DEU.34.2	 and all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the distant
DEU.34.3	 the Negev, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of the date palm trees, as far as Zoar. 
DEU.34.4	 Then the 
DEU.34.5	 So Moses, the servant of the 
DEU.34.6	 He
DEU.34.7	 Moses was 120 years old when he died, but his eye was not dull
DEU.34.8	 The Israelites mourned for Moses in the deserts of Moab for thirty days; then the days of mourning for Moses ended.
DEU.34.9	 Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had placed his hands on him;
DEU.34.10	 No prophet ever again arose in Israel like Moses, who knew the 
DEU.34.11	 He did
DEU.34.12	 and he displayed great power
JOS.1.1	 After Moses the 
JOS.1.2	 “Moses my servant is dead. Get ready!
JOS.1.3	 I am handing over to you every place you set foot, as I promised Moses.
JOS.1.4	 Your territory will extend from the wilderness in the south to Lebanon in the north. It will extend all the way to the great River Euphrates in the east (including all of Syria)
JOS.1.5	 No one will be able to resist you
JOS.1.6	 Be strong and brave! You must lead these people in the conquest of this land that I solemnly promised their ancestors I would hand over to them.
JOS.1.7	 Make sure you are
JOS.1.8	 This law scroll must not leave your lips!
JOS.1.9	 I repeat,
JOS.1.10	 Joshua instructed
JOS.1.11	 “Go through the camp and command the people, ‘Prepare your supplies, for within three days you will cross the Jordan River and begin the conquest of the land the 
JOS.1.12	 Joshua told the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh: 
JOS.1.13	 “Remember what Moses the 
JOS.1.14	 Your wives, children and cattle may stay in the land that Moses assigned to you east of the Jordan River. But all you warriors must cross over armed for battle ahead of your brothers.
JOS.1.15	 until the 
JOS.1.16	 They told Joshua, “We will do everything you say. We will go wherever you send us. 
JOS.1.17	 Just as we obeyed
JOS.1.18	 Any man who rebels against what you say and does not obey all your commands will be executed.
JOS.2.1	 Joshua son of Nun sent two spies out from Shittim secretly and instructed them:
JOS.2.2	 The king of Jericho received this report: “Note well!
JOS.2.3	 So the king of Jericho sent this order to Rahab:
JOS.2.4	 But the woman hid the two men
JOS.2.5	 When it was time to shut the city gate for the night, the men left.
JOS.2.6	 (Now she had taken them up to the roof and had hidden them in the stalks of flax she had spread out
JOS.2.7	 Meanwhile
JOS.2.8	 Now before the spies
JOS.2.9	 She said to the men, “I know the 
JOS.2.10	 For we heard how the 
JOS.2.11	 When we heard the news we lost our courage and no one could even breathe for fear of you.
JOS.2.12	 So now, promise me this with an oath sworn in the 
JOS.2.13	 that you will spare the lives of my father, mother, brothers, sisters, and all who belong to them, and rescue us

JOS.2.19	 Anyone who leaves your house will be responsible for his own death – we are innocent in that case!
JOS.2.20	 If you should report what we’ve been up to,
JOS.2.21	 She said, “I agree to these conditions.”
JOS.2.22	 They went
JOS.2.23	 Then the two men returned – they came down from the hills, crossed the river,
JOS.2.24	 They told Joshua, “Surely the 
JOS.3.1	 Bright and early the next morning Joshua and the Israelites left Shittim and came to the Jordan.
JOS.3.2	 After three days the leaders went through the camp 
JOS.3.3	 and commanded the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the

JOS.3.5	 Joshua told the people, “Ritually consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the

JOS.4.5	 Joshua told them, “Go in front of the ark of the 
JOS.4.6	 The stones

JOS.4.8	 The Israelites did just as Joshua commanded. They picked up twelve stones, according to the number of the Israelite tribes, from the middle of the Jordan as the 
JOS.4.9	 Joshua also set up twelve stones
JOS.4.10	 Now the priests carrying the ark of the covenant were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the Lord had commanded Joshua to tell the people was accomplished, in accordance with all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people went across quickly, 
JOS.4.11	 and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the 
JOS.4.12	 The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed for battle ahead of the Israelites, just as Moses had instructed them.

JOS.5.4	 This is why Joshua had to circumcise them: All the men old enough to fight when they left Egypt died on the journey through the desert after they left Egypt.
JOS.5.5	 Now
JOS.5.6	 Indeed, for forty years the Israelites traveled through the desert until all the men old enough to fight when they left Egypt, the ones who had disobeyed the

JOS.5.11	 They ate some of the produce of the land the day after the Passover, including unleavened bread and roasted grain.
JOS.5.12	 The manna stopped appearing the day they ate

JOS.6.8	 When Joshua gave the army its orders,
JOS.6.9	 Armed troops marched ahead of the priests blowing the horns, while the rear guard followed along behind the ark blowing rams’ horns. 
JOS.6.10	 Now Joshua had instructed the army,
JOS.6.11	 So Joshua made sure they marched the ark of the

JOS.6.23	 So the young spies went and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out her whole family and took them to a place outside
JOS.6.24	 But they burned
JOS.6.25	 Yet Joshua spared
JOS.6.26	 At that time Joshua made this solemn declaration:
JOS.6.27	 The 
JOS.7.1	 But the Israelites disobeyed the command about the city’s riches.
JOS.7.2	 Joshua sent men from Jericho
JOS.7.3	 They returned and reported to Joshua,
JOS.7.4	 So about three thousand men went up, but they fled from the men of Ai. 
JOS.7.5	 The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them and chased them from in front of the city gate all the way to the fissures
JOS.7.6	 Joshua tore his clothes;
JOS.7.7	 Joshua prayed,
JOS.7.8	 If only we had been satisfied to live on the other side of the Jordan! O Lord, what can I say now that Israel has retreated
JOS.7.9	 When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this, they will turn against us and destroy the very memory of us
JOS.7.10	 The 
JOS.7.11	 Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenantal commandment!
JOS.7.12	 The Israelites are unable to stand before their enemies; they retreat because they have become subject to annihilation.
JOS.7.13	 Get up! Ritually consecrate the people and tell them this: ‘Ritually consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, because the 
JOS.7.14	 In the morning you must approach in tribal order.
JOS.7.15	 The one caught with the riches
JOS.7.16	 Bright and early the next morning Joshua made Israel approach in tribal order
JOS.7.17	 He then made the clans of Judah approach and the clan of the Zerahites was selected. He made the clan of the Zerahites approach and Zabdi
JOS.7.18	 He then made Zabdi’s
JOS.7.19	 So Joshua said to Achan, “My son, honor
JOS.7.20	 Achan told Joshua, “It is true. I have sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	 I saw among the goods we seized a nice robe from Babylon,
JOS.7.22	 Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent. The things were hidden right in his tent, with the silver underneath.
JOS.7.23	 They took it all from the middle of the tent, brought it to Joshua and all the Israelites, and placed
JOS.7.24	 Then Joshua and all Israel took Achan, son of Zerah, along with the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons, daughters, ox, donkey, sheep, tent, and all that belonged to him and brought them up to the Valley of Disaster.
JOS.7.25	 Joshua said, “Why have you brought disaster
JOS.7.26	 Then they erected over him a large pile of stones (it remains to this very day
JOS.8.1	 The 
JOS.8.2	 Do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho
JOS.8.3	 Joshua and the whole army marched against Ai.
JOS.8.4	 He told
JOS.8.5	 I and all the troops
JOS.8.6	 They will attack
JOS.8.7	 Then you rise up from your hiding place
JOS.8.8	 When you capture the city, set it
JOS.8.9	 Joshua sent them away and they went to their hiding place
JOS.8.10	 Bright and early the next morning Joshua gathered
JOS.8.11	 All the troops that were with him marched up and drew near the city.
JOS.8.12	 He took five thousand men and set an ambush west of the city between Bethel
JOS.8.13	 The army was in position – the main army north of the city and the rear guard west of the city. That night Joshua went into
JOS.8.14	 When the king of Ai saw Israel, he and his whole army quickly got up the next day and went out to fight Israel at the meeting place near the Arabah.
JOS.8.15	 Joshua and all Israel pretended to be defeated by them and they retreated along the way to the desert. 
JOS.8.16	 All the reinforcements
JOS.8.17	 No men were left in Ai or Bethel;
JOS.8.18	 The 
JOS.8.19	 When he held out his hand, the men waiting in ambush rose up quickly from their place and attacked.
JOS.8.20	 When the men of Ai turned around, they saw
JOS.8.21	 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that the city was going up in smoke,
JOS.8.22	 At the same time the men who had taken the city came out to fight, and the men of Ai were trapped in the middle.
JOS.8.23	 But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	 When Israel had finished killing all the men
JOS.8.25	 Twelve thousand men and women died
JOS.8.26	 Joshua kept holding out his curved sword until Israel had annihilated all who lived in Ai.
JOS.8.27	 But Israel did plunder the cattle and the goods of the city, in accordance with the 
JOS.8.28	 Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanently uninhabited mound (it remains that way to this very day).
JOS.8.29	 He hung the king of Ai on a tree, leaving him exposed until evening.
JOS.8.30	 Then Joshua built an altar for the 
JOS.8.31	 just as Moses the 
JOS.8.32	 There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua inscribed on the stones a duplicate of the law written by Moses.
JOS.8.33	 All the people,
JOS.8.34	 Then
JOS.8.35	 Joshua read aloud every commandment Moses had given
JOS.9.1	 When the news reached all the kings on the west side of the Jordan
JOS.9.2	 they formed an alliance to fight against Joshua and Israel.
JOS.9.3	 When the residents of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho
JOS.9.4	 they did something clever. They collected some provisions
JOS.9.5	 They had worn-out, patched sandals on their feet and dressed in worn-out clothes. All their bread
JOS.9.6	 They came to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant land. Make a treaty with us.” 
JOS.9.7	 The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you live near us.
JOS.9.8	 But they said to Joshua, “We are willing to be your subjects.”
JOS.9.9	 They told him, “Your subjects
JOS.9.10	 and all he did to the two Amorite kings on the other side of the Jordan – King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan in Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	 Our leaders and all who live in our land told us, ‘Take provisions for your journey and go meet them. Tell them, “We are willing to be your subjects.
JOS.9.12	 This bread of ours was warm when we packed it in our homes the day we started out to meet you,
JOS.9.13	 These wineskins we filled were brand new, but look how they have ripped. Our clothes and sandals have worn out because it has been a very long journey.” 
JOS.9.14	 The men examined
JOS.9.15	 Joshua made a peace treaty with them and agreed to let them live. The leaders of the community
JOS.9.16	 Three days after they made the treaty with them, the Israelites found out they were from the local area and lived nearby.
JOS.9.17	 So the Israelites set out and on the third day arrived at their cities – Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim. 
JOS.9.18	 The Israelites did not attack them because the leaders of the community had sworn an oath to them in the name of the 
JOS.9.19	 but all the leaders told the whole community, “We swore an oath to them in the name of
JOS.9.20	 We must let them live so we can escape the curse attached to the oath we swore to them.”
JOS.9.21	 The leaders then added,
JOS.9.22	 Joshua summoned the Gibeonites
JOS.9.23	 Now you are condemned to perpetual servitude as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
JOS.9.24	 They said to Joshua, “It was carefully reported to your subjects
JOS.9.25	 So now we are in your power.
JOS.9.26	 Joshua did as they said; he kept the Israelites from killing them
JOS.9.27	 and that day made them woodcutters and water carriers for the community and for the altar of the 
JOS.10.1	 Adoni-Zedek, king of Jerusalem,
JOS.10.2	 All Jerusalem was terrified
JOS.10.3	 So King Adoni-Zedek of Jerusalem sent this message to King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon: 
JOS.10.4	 “Come to my aid
JOS.10.5	 So the five Amorite kings (the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon) and all their troops gathered together and advanced. They deployed their troops and fought against Gibeon.
JOS.10.6	 The men of Gibeon sent this message to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, “Do not abandon
JOS.10.7	 So Joshua and his whole army, including the bravest warriors, marched up from Gilgal.
JOS.10.8	 The 
JOS.10.9	 Joshua attacked them by surprise after marching all night from Gilgal.
JOS.10.10	 The 
JOS.10.11	 As they fled from Israel on the slope leading down from
JOS.10.12	 The day the 
JOS.10.12	“O sun, stand still over Gibeon! 
JOS.10.12	O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon!” 
JOS.10.13	 The sun stood still and the moon stood motionless while the nation took vengeance on its enemies. The event is recorded in the Scroll of the Upright One.
JOS.10.14	 There has not been a day like it before or since. The 
JOS.10.15	 Then Joshua and all Israel returned to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	 The five Amorite kings
JOS.10.17	 Joshua was told, “The five kings have been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah.” 
JOS.10.18	 Joshua said, “Roll large stones over the mouth of the cave and post guards in front of it.
JOS.10.19	 But don’t you delay! Chase your enemies and catch them!
JOS.10.20	 Joshua and the Israelites almost totally wiped them out, but some survivors did escape to the fortified cities.
JOS.10.21	 Then the whole army safely returned to Joshua at the camp in Makkedah.
JOS.10.22	 Joshua said, “Open the cave’s mouth and bring the five kings
JOS.10.23	 They did as ordered;
JOS.10.24	 When they brought the kings out to Joshua, he
JOS.10.25	 Then Joshua said to them, “Don’t be afraid and don’t panic!
JOS.10.26	 Then Joshua executed them
JOS.10.27	 At sunset Joshua ordered his men to take them down from the trees.
JOS.10.28	 That day Joshua captured Makkedah and put the sword to it and its king. He annihilated everyone who lived in it; he left no survivors. He did to its king what he had done to the king of Jericho.
JOS.10.29	 Joshua and all Israel marched from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against it.
JOS.10.30	 The 
JOS.10.31	 Joshua and all Israel marched from Libnah to Lachish. He deployed his troops

JOS.10.37	 They captured it and put the sword to its king, all its surrounding cities, and all who lived in it; they

JOS.10.43	 Then Joshua and all Israel returned to the camp at Gilgal. 
JOS.11.1	 When King Jabin of Hazor
JOS.11.2	 and the northern kings who ruled in

JOS.22.10	 The Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan and built there, near the Jordan, an impressive altar.
JOS.22.11	 The Israelites received this report:
JOS.22.12	 When the Israelites heard this, the entire Israelite community assembled at Shiloh to launch an attack against them.
JOS.22.13	 The Israelites sent Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.22.14	 He was accompanied by ten leaders, one from each of the Israelite tribes, each one a family leader among the Israelite clans.
JOS.22.15	 They went to the land of Gilead to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and said to them: 
JOS.22.16	 “The entire community of the 
JOS.22.17	 The sin we committed at Peor was bad enough. To this very day we have not purified ourselves; it even brought a plague on the community of the

JOS.22.32	 Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest, and the leaders left the Reubenites and Gadites in the land of Gilead and reported back to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.

JOS.22.34	 The Reubenites and Gadites named the altar, “Surely it is a Reminder to us

JOS.24.32	 The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the part of the field that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of money.

JDG.2.23	 This is why
JDG.3.1	 These were the nations the 
JDG.3.2	 He left those nations simply because he wanted to teach the subsequent generations of Israelites, who had not experienced the earlier battles, how to conduct holy war.

JDG.4.16	 Now Barak chased the chariots and the army all the way to Harosheth Haggoyim. Sisera’s whole army died
JDG.4.17	 Now Sisera ran away on foot to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, for King Jabin of Hazor
JDG.4.18	 Jael came out to welcome Sisera. She said to him, “Stop and rest,
JDG.4.19	 He said to her, “Give me a little water to drink, because I’m thirsty.” She opened a goatskin container of milk and gave him some milk to drink. Then she covered him up again. 
JDG.4.20	 He said to her, “Stand watch at the entrance to the tent. If anyone comes along and asks you, ‘Is there a man here?’ say ‘No.’” 
JDG.4.21	 Then Jael wife of Heber took a tent peg in one hand and a hammer in the other.
JDG.4.22	 Now Barak was chasing Sisera. Jael went out to welcome him. She said to him, “Come here and I will show you the man you are searching for.” He went with her into the tent,
JDG.4.23	 That day God humiliated King Jabin of Canaan before the Israelites. 
JDG.4.24	 Israel’s power continued to overwhelm
JDG.5.1	 On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this victory song:
JDG.5.2	 “When the leaders took the lead
JDG.5.2	When the people answered the call to war – 
JDG.5.2	Praise the 
JDG.5.3	 Hear, O kings!
JDG.5.3	Pay attention, O rulers!
JDG.5.3	I will sing to the 
JDG.5.3	I will sing
JDG.5.4	 O 
JDG.5.4	when you marched from Edom’s plains,
JDG.5.4	the earth shook, the heavens poured down,
JDG.5.4	the clouds poured down rain.
JDG.5.5	 The mountains trembled
JDG.5.5	before the 
JDG.5.6	 In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,
JDG.5.6	in the days of Jael caravans
JDG.5.6	travelers
JDG.5.7	 Warriors
JDG.5.7	they were scarce in Israel,
JDG.5.7	until you
JDG.5.7	until you arose as a motherly protector
JDG.5.8	 God chose new leaders,
JDG.5.8	then fighters appeared in the city gates;
JDG.5.8	but, I swear, not a shield or spear could be found,
JDG.5.8	among forty military units
JDG.5.9	 My heart went out
JDG.5.9	to the people who answered the call to war. 
JDG.5.9	Praise the 
JDG.5.10	 You who ride on light-colored female donkeys,
JDG.5.10	who sit on saddle blankets,
JDG.5.10	you who walk on the road, pay attention!
JDG.5.11	 Hear
JDG.5.11	there they tell of
JDG.5.11	the victorious deeds of his warriors
JDG.5.11	Then the 
JDG.5.12	 Wake up, wake up, Deborah!
JDG.5.12	Wake up, wake up, sing a song!
JDG.5.12	Get up, Barak!
JDG.5.12	Capture your prisoners of war,

JDG.5.13	the 
JDG.5.14	 They came from Ephraim, who uprooted Amalek,
JDG.5.14	they follow
JDG.5.14	From Makir leaders came down,
JDG.5.14	from Zebulun came
JDG.5.15	 Issachar’s leaders were with Deborah,
JDG.5.15	the men of Issachar
JDG.5.15	into the valley they were sent under Barak’s command.
JDG.5.15	Among the clans of Reuben there was intense
JDG.5.16	 Why do you remain among the sheepfolds,
JDG.5.16	listening to the shepherds playing their pipes
JDG.5.16	As for the clans of Reuben – there was intense searching of heart.
JDG.5.17	 Gilead stayed put
JDG.5.17	As for Dan – why did he seek temporary employment in the shipyards?
JDG.5.17	Asher remained
JDG.5.17	he stayed
JDG.5.18	 The men of Zebulun were not concerned about their lives;
JDG.5.18	Naphtali charged on to the battlefields.
JDG.5.19	 Kings came, they fought;
JDG.5.19	the kings of Canaan fought,
JDG.5.19	at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo,
JDG.5.19	but
JDG.5.20	 From the sky
JDG.5.20	from their paths in the heavens
JDG.5.21	 The Kishon River carried them off;
JDG.5.21	the river confronted them
JDG.5.21	Step on the necks of the strong!
JDG.5.22	 The horses’
JDG.5.22	the stallions galloped madly.
JDG.5.23	 ‘Call judgment down on

JDG.5.23	because they did not come to help in the 
JDG.5.23	to help in the

JDG.5.24	She should be the most rewarded of women who live in tents.
JDG.5.25	 He asked for water,
JDG.5.25	and she gave him milk;
JDG.5.25	in a bowl fit for a king,
JDG.5.25	she served him curds.
JDG.5.26	 Her left
JDG.5.26	her right hand for the workmen’s hammer.
JDG.5.26	She “hammered”
JDG.5.26	she shattered his skull,
JDG.5.26	she smashed his head,
JDG.5.26	she drove the tent peg through his temple.
JDG.5.27	 Between her feet he collapsed,
JDG.5.27	he fell limp
JDG.5.27	between her feet he collapsed and fell limp, 
JDG.5.27	in the spot where he collapsed,
JDG.5.27	there he fell limp – violently murdered!
JDG.5.28	 Through the window she looked;
JDG.5.28	Sisera’s mother cried out through the lattice:
JDG.5.28	‘Why is his chariot so slow to return?
JDG.5.28	Why are the hoofbeats of his chariot-horses
JDG.5.29	 The wisest of her ladies
JDG.5.29	indeed she even thinks to herself,
JDG.5.30	 ‘No doubt they are gathering and dividing the plunder
JDG.5.30	a girl or two for each man to rape!
JDG.5.30	Sisera is grabbing up colorful cloth,
JDG.5.30	he is grabbing up colorful embroidered cloth,
JDG.5.30	two pieces of colorful embroidered cloth,
JDG.5.30	for the neck of the plunderer!’
JDG.5.31	 May all your enemies perish like this, O 
JDG.5.31	But may those who love you shine
JDG.5.31	like the rising sun at its brightest!”
JDG.5.31	And the land had rest for forty years.
JDG.6.1	 The Israelites did evil in the 
JDG.6.2	 The Midianites
JDG.6.3	 Whenever the Israelites planted their crops,
JDG.6.4	 They invaded the land
JDG.6.5	 When they invaded
JDG.6.6	 Israel was so severely weakened by Midian that the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.6.7	 When the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.6.8	 he
JDG.6.9	 I rescued you from Egypt’s power
JDG.6.10	 I said to you, “I am the 
JDG.6.11	 The 
JDG.6.12	 The 
JDG.6.13	 Gideon said to him, “Pardon me,
JDG.6.14	 Then the 
JDG.6.15	 Gideon
JDG.6.16	 The 
JDG.6.17	 Gideon
JDG.6.18	 Do not leave this place until I come back
JDG.6.19	 Gideon went and prepared a young goat,
JDG.6.20	 God’s messenger said to him, “Put the meat and unleavened bread on this rock,
JDG.6.21	 The 
JDG.6.22	 When Gideon realized
JDG.6.23	 The 
JDG.6.24	 Gideon built an altar for the 
JDG.6.25	 That night the 
JDG.6.26	 Then build an altar for the 
JDG.6.27	 So Gideon took ten of his servants
JDG.6.28	 When the men of the city got up the next morning, they saw
JDG.6.29	 They said to one another,
JDG.6.30	 The men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, so we can execute him!
JDG.6.31	 But Joash said to all those who confronted him,
JDG.6.32	 That very day Gideon’s father named him Jerub-Baal,
JDG.6.33	 All the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people from the east
JDG.6.34	 The 
JDG.6.35	 He sent messengers throughout Manasseh and summoned them to follow him as well.
JDG.6.36	 Gideon said to God, “If you really intend to use me to deliver Israel,
JDG.6.37	 Look, I am putting a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and the ground around it
JDG.6.38	 The 
JDG.6.39	 Gideon said to God, “Please do not get angry at me, when I ask for just one more sign.
JDG.6.40	 That night God did as he asked.
JDG.7.1	 Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and his men
JDG.7.2	 The 
JDG.7.3	 Now, announce to the men,
JDG.7.4	 The 
JDG.7.5	 So he brought the men
JDG.7.6	 Three hundred men lapped;
JDG.7.7	 The 
JDG.7.8	 The men
JDG.7.9	 That night the 
JDG.7.10	 But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with Purah your servant 
JDG.7.11	 and listen to what they are saying. Then you will be brave
JDG.7.12	 Now the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people from the east covered the valley like a swarm of locusts.
JDG.7.13	 When Gideon arrived, he heard a man telling another man about a dream he had.
JDG.7.14	 The other man said,
JDG.7.15	 When Gideon heard the report of the dream and its interpretation, he praised God.
JDG.7.16	 He divided the three hundred men into three units.
JDG.7.17	 He said to them, “Watch me and do as I do. Watch closely!
JDG.7.18	 When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, you also blow your trumpets all around the camp. Then say, ‘For the 
JDG.7.19	 Gideon took a hundred men to the edge of the camp
JDG.7.20	 All three units blew their trumpets and broke their jars. They held the torches in their left hand and the trumpets in their right.
JDG.7.21	 They stood in order
JDG.7.22	 When the three hundred men blew their trumpets, the 
JDG.7.23	 Israelites from Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh answered the call and chased the Midianites.
JDG.7.24	 Now Gideon sent messengers throughout the Ephraimite hill country who announced, “Go down and head off the Midianites.
JDG.7.25	 They captured the two Midianite generals, Oreb and Zeeb.
JDG.8.1	 The Ephraimites said to him, “Why have you done such a thing to us? You did not summon us
JDG.8.2	 He said to them, “Now what have I accomplished compared to you? Even Ephraim’s leftover grapes
JDG.8.3	 It was to you that God handed over the Midianite generals, Oreb and Zeeb! What did I accomplish to rival that?”
JDG.8.4	 Now Gideon and his three hundred men had crossed over the Jordan River, and even though they were exhausted, they were still chasing the Midianites.
JDG.8.5	 He said to the men of Succoth, “Give
JDG.8.6	 The officials of Succoth said, “You have not yet overpowered Zebah and Zalmunna. So why should we give
JDG.8.7	 Gideon said, “Since you will not help,
JDG.8.8	 He went up from there to Penuel and made the same request.
JDG.8.9	 He also threatened
JDG.8.10	 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their armies. There were about fifteen thousand survivors from the army of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand sword-wielding soldiers had been killed.
JDG.8.11	 Gideon went up the road of the nomads
JDG.8.12	 When Zebah and Zalmunna ran away, Gideon
JDG.8.13	 Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the pass
JDG.8.14	 He captured a young man from Succoth
JDG.8.15	 He approached the men of Succoth and said, “Look what I have!
JDG.8.16	 He seized the leaders
JDG.8.17	 He also tore down the tower of Penuel and executed the city’s men.
JDG.8.18	 He said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “Describe for me
JDG.8.19	 He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. I swear,
JDG.8.20	 He ordered Jether his firstborn son, “Come on!
JDG.8.21	 Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon,
JDG.8.22	 The men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us – you, your son, and your grandson. For you have delivered us from Midian’s power.”
JDG.8.23	 Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The 
JDG.8.24	 Gideon continued,
JDG.8.25	 They said, “We are happy to give you earrings.”
JDG.8.26	 The total weight of the gold earrings he requested came to seventeen hundred gold shekels.
JDG.8.27	 Gideon used all this to make
JDG.8.28	 The Israelites humiliated Midian; the Midianites’ fighting spirit was broken.
JDG.8.29	 Then Jerub-Baal son of Joash went home and settled down.
JDG.8.30	 Gideon fathered seventy sons through his many wives.
JDG.8.31	 His concubine,
JDG.8.32	 Gideon son of Joash died at a very
JDG.8.33	 After Gideon died, the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They made Baal-Berith
JDG.8.34	 The Israelites did not remain true
JDG.8.35	 They did not treat
JDG.9.1	 Now Abimelech son of Jerub-Baal went to Shechem to see his mother’s relatives.
JDG.9.2	 “Tell
JDG.9.3	 His mother’s relatives
JDG.9.4	 They paid him seventy silver shekels out of the temple of Baal-Berith. Abimelech then used the silver to hire some lawless, dangerous
JDG.9.5	 He went to his father’s home in Ophrah and murdered his half-brothers,
JDG.9.6	 All the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo assembled and then went and made Abimelech king by the oak near the pillar
JDG.9.7	 When Jotham heard the news,
JDG.9.8	 “The trees were determined to go out
JDG.9.9	 But the olive tree said to them, ‘I am not going to stop producing my oil, which is used to honor gods and men, just to sway above the other trees!’
JDG.9.10	 “So the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and be our king!’
JDG.9.11	 But the fig tree said to them, ‘I am not going to stop producing my sweet figs, my excellent fruit, just to sway above the other trees!’
JDG.9.12	 “So the trees said to the grapevine, ‘You come and be our king!’
JDG.9.13	 But the grapevine said to them, ‘I am not going to stop producing my wine, which makes gods and men so happy, just to sway above the other trees!’
JDG.9.14	 “So all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘You come and be our king!’
JDG.9.15	 The thornbush said to the trees, ‘If you really want to choose
JDG.9.16	 “Now, if you have shown loyalty and integrity when you made Abimelech king, if you have done right to Jerub-Baal and his family,
JDG.9.17	 my father fought for you; he risked his life
JDG.9.18	 But you have attacked
JDG.9.19	 So if you have shown loyalty and integrity to Jerub-Baal and his family
JDG.9.20	 But if not, may fire blaze from Abimelech and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo! May fire also blaze from the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo and consume Abimelech!” 
JDG.9.21	 Then Jotham ran away
JDG.9.22	 Abimelech commanded
JDG.9.23	 God sent a spirit to stir up hostility
JDG.9.24	 He did this so the violent deaths of Jerub-Baal’s seventy sons might be avenged and Abimelech, their half-brother
JDG.9.25	 The leaders of Shechem rebelled against Abimelech by putting
JDG.9.26	 Gaal son of Ebed
JDG.9.27	 They went out to the field, harvested their grapes,
JDG.9.28	 Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerub-Baal, and is not Zebul the deputy he appointed?
JDG.9.29	 If only these men
JDG.9.30	 When Zebul, the city commissioner, heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he was furious.
JDG.9.31	 He sent messengers to Abimelech, who was in Arumah,
JDG.9.32	 Now, come up
JDG.9.33	 In the morning at sunrise quickly attack the city. When he and his men come out to fight you, do what you can to him.”
JDG.9.34	 So Abimelech and all his men came up
JDG.9.35	 When Gaal son of Ebed came out and stood at the entrance to the city’s gate, Abimelech and his men got up from their hiding places. 
JDG.9.36	 Gaal saw the men
JDG.9.37	 Gaal again said, “Look, men are coming down from the very center
JDG.9.38	 Zebul said to him, “Where now are your bragging words,
JDG.9.39	 So Gaal led the leaders of Shechem out
JDG.9.40	 Abimelech chased him, and Gaal
JDG.9.41	 Abimelech went back
JDG.9.42	 The next day the Shechemites
JDG.9.43	 he took his men
JDG.9.44	 Abimelech and his units
JDG.9.45	 Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed all the people in it. Then he leveled
JDG.9.46	 When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem
JDG.9.47	 Abimelech heard
JDG.9.48	 He and all his men
JDG.9.49	 So each of his men also cut off a branch and followed Abimelech. They put the branches
JDG.9.50	 Abimelech moved on
JDG.9.51	 There was a fortified
JDG.9.52	 Abimelech came and attacked the tower. When he approached the entrance of the tower to set it on fire, 
JDG.9.53	 a woman threw an upper millstone
JDG.9.54	 He quickly called to the young man who carried his weapons,
JDG.9.55	 When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they went home.
JDG.9.56	 God repaid Abimelech for the evil he did to his father by murdering his seventy half-brothers.
JDG.9.57	 God also repaid the men of Shechem for their evil deeds. The curse spoken by Jotham son of Jerub-Baal fell
JDG.10.1	 After Abimelech’s death,
JDG.10.2	 He led
JDG.10.3	 Jair the Gileadite rose up after him; he led Israel for twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys and possessed thirty cities. To this day these towns are called Havvoth Jair
JDG.10.5	 Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
JDG.10.6	 The Israelites again did evil in the 
JDG.10.7	 The 
JDG.10.8	 They ruthlessly oppressed
JDG.10.9	 The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight with Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim.
JDG.10.10	 The Israelites cried out for help to the 
JDG.10.11	 The 
JDG.10.12	 the Sidonians, Amalek, and Midian
JDG.10.13	 But since you abandoned me and worshiped
JDG.10.14	 Go and cry for help to the gods you have chosen! Let them deliver you from trouble!”
JDG.10.15	 But the Israelites said to the 
JDG.10.16	 They threw away the foreign gods they owned
JDG.10.17	 The Ammonites assembled
JDG.10.18	 The leaders
JDG.11.1	 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a brave warrior. His mother was a prostitute, but Gilead was his father.
JDG.11.2	 Gilead’s wife also gave
JDG.11.3	 So Jephthah left
JDG.11.4	 It was some time after this when the Ammonites fought with Israel. 
JDG.11.5	 When the Ammonites attacked,
JDG.11.6	 They said,
JDG.11.7	 Jephthah said to the leaders of Gilead, “But you hated me and made me leave
JDG.11.8	 The leaders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That may be true,
JDG.11.9	 Jephthah said to the leaders of Gilead, “All right!
JDG.11.10	 The leaders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The 
JDG.11.11	 So Jephthah went with the leaders of Gilead. The people made him their leader and commander. Jephthah repeated the terms of the agreement
JDG.11.12	 Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king, saying, “Why have
JDG.11.13	 The Ammonite king said to Jephthah’s messengers, “Because Israel stole
JDG.11.14	 Jephthah sent messengers back to the Ammonite king 
JDG.11.15	 and said to him, “This is what Jephthah says, ‘Israel did not steal
JDG.11.16	 When they left
JDG.11.17	 Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Please allow us
JDG.11.18	 Then Israel
JDG.11.19	 Israel sent messengers to King Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, “Please allow us to pass through your land to our land.”
JDG.11.20	 But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. He
JDG.11.21	 The 
JDG.11.22	 They took all the Amorite territory from the Arnon River on the south to the Jabbok River on the north, from the desert in the east to the Jordan in the west.
JDG.11.23	 Since
JDG.11.24	 You have the right to take what Chemosh your god gives you, but we will take the land of all whom the 
JDG.11.25	 Are you really better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he dare to quarrel with Israel? Did he dare to fight with them?
JDG.11.26	 Israel has been living in Heshbon and its nearby towns, in Aroer and its nearby towns, and in all the cities along the Arnon for three hundred years! Why did you not reclaim them during that time? 
JDG.11.27	 I have not done you wrong,
JDG.11.28	 But the Ammonite king disregarded
JDG.11.29	 The 
JDG.11.30	 Jephthah made a vow to the 
JDG.11.31	 then whoever is the first to come through
JDG.11.32	 Jephthah approached
JDG.11.33	 He defeated them from Aroer all the way to Minnith – twenty cities in all, even as far as Abel Keramim! He wiped them out!
JDG.11.34	 When Jephthah came home to Mizpah, there was his daughter hurrying out
JDG.11.35	 When he saw her, he ripped his clothes and said, “Oh no! My daughter! You have completely ruined me!
JDG.11.36	 She said to him, “My father, since
JDG.11.37	 She then said to her father, “Please grant me this one wish.
JDG.11.38	 He said, “You may go.” He permitted her to leave
JDG.11.39	 After two months she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. She died a virgin.
JDG.11.40	 Every year
JDG.12.1	 The Ephraimites assembled
JDG.12.2	 Jephthah said to them, “My people and I were entangled in controversy with the Ammonites.
JDG.12.3	 When I saw that you were not going to help,
JDG.12.4	 Jephthah assembled all the men of Gilead and they fought with Ephraim. The men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because the Ephraimites insulted them, saying,
JDG.12.5	 The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan River
JDG.12.6	 then they said to him, “Say ‘Shibboleth!’”
JDG.12.7	 Jephthah led
JDG.12.8	 After him Ibzan of Bethlehem
JDG.12.9	 He had thirty sons. He arranged for thirty of his daughters to be married outside his extended family,
JDG.12.10	 then he
JDG.12.11	 After him Elon the Zebulunite led
JDG.12.12	 Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	 After him Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite led
JDG.12.14	 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys. He led Israel for eight years. 
JDG.12.15	 Then Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites. 
JDG.13.1	 The Israelites again did evil in the 
JDG.13.2	 There was a man named Manoah from Zorah, from the Danite tribe. His wife was infertile and childless.
JDG.13.3	 The 
JDG.13.4	 Now be careful! Do not drink wine or beer, and do not eat any food that will make you ritually unclean.
JDG.13.5	 Look, you will conceive and have a son.
JDG.13.6	 The woman went and said to her husband, “A man sent from God
JDG.13.7	 He said to me, ‘Look, you will conceive and have a son.
JDG.13.8	 Manoah prayed to the 
JDG.13.9	 God answered Manoah’s prayer.
JDG.13.10	 The woman ran at once and told her husband,
JDG.13.11	 So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he met
JDG.13.12	 Manoah said, “Now, when your announcement comes true,
JDG.13.13	 The 
JDG.13.14	 She should not drink
JDG.13.15	 Manoah said to the 
JDG.13.16	 The 
JDG.13.17	 Manoah said to the 
JDG.13.18	 The 
JDG.13.19	 Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the 
JDG.13.20	 As the flame went up from the altar toward the sky, the 
JDG.13.21	 The 
JDG.13.22	 Manoah said to his wife, “We will certainly die, because we have seen a supernatural being!”
JDG.13.23	 But his wife said to him, “If the 
JDG.13.24	 Manoah’s wife

JDG.14.1	 Samson went down to Timnah, where a Philistine girl caught his eye.
JDG.14.2	 When he got home,
JDG.14.3	 But his father and mother said to him, “Certainly you can find a wife among your relatives or among all our
JDG.14.4	 Now his father and mother did not realize this was the 
JDG.14.5	 Samson went down to Timnah. When he approached
JDG.14.6	 The 
JDG.14.7	 Samson continued on down to Timnah
JDG.14.8	 Some time later, when he went back to marry
JDG.14.9	 He scooped it up with his hands and ate it as he walked along. When he returned
JDG.14.10	 Then Samson’s father accompanied him to Timnah for the marriage.
JDG.14.11	 When the Philistines saw he had no attendants, they gave him thirty groomsmen who kept him company.
JDG.14.12	 Samson said to them, “I will give you a riddle. If you really can solve it during the seven days the party lasts,
JDG.14.13	 But if you cannot solve it,
JDG.14.14	 He said to them,
JDG.14.14	“Out of the one who eats came something to eat;
JDG.14.14	out of the strong one came something sweet.”
JDG.14.14	They could not solve the riddle for three days. 
JDG.14.15	 On the fourth
JDG.14.16	 So Samson’s bride cried on his shoulder
JDG.14.17	 She cried on his shoulder
JDG.14.18	 On the seventh day, before the sun set, the men of the city said to him,
JDG.14.18	“What is sweeter than honey?
JDG.14.18	What is stronger than a lion?”
JDG.14.18	He said to them,
JDG.14.18	“If you had not plowed with my heifer,
JDG.14.18	you would not have solved my riddle!” 
JDG.14.19	 The 
JDG.14.20	 Samson’s bride was then given to his best man.
JDG.15.1	 Sometime later, during the wheat harvest,
JDG.15.2	 Her father said, “I really thought
JDG.15.3	 Samson said to them,
JDG.15.4	 Samson went and captured three hundred jackals
JDG.15.5	 He lit the torches
JDG.15.6	 The Philistines asked,
JDG.15.7	 Samson said to them, “Because you did this,
JDG.15.8	 He struck them down and defeated them.
JDG.15.9	 The Philistines went up and invaded
JDG.15.10	 The men of Judah said, “Why are you attacking
JDG.15.11	 Three thousand men of Judah went down to the cave in the cliff of Etam and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? Why have you done this to us?” He said to them, “I have only done to them what they have done to me.” 
JDG.15.12	 They said to him, “We have come down to take you prisoner so we can hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson said to them, “Promise me
JDG.15.13	 They said to him, “We promise!
JDG.15.14	 When he arrived in Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they approached him. But the 
JDG.15.15	 He happened to see
JDG.15.16	 Samson then said,
JDG.15.16	“With the jawbone of a donkey 
JDG.15.16	I have left them in heaps;
JDG.15.16	with the jawbone of a donkey 
JDG.15.16	I have struck down a thousand men!”
JDG.15.17	 When he finished speaking, he threw the jawbone down
JDG.15.18	 He was very thirsty, so he cried out to the 
JDG.15.19	 So God split open the basin
JDG.15.20	 Samson led
JDG.16.1	 Samson went to Gaza. There he saw a prostitute and went in to have sex with her.
JDG.16.2	 The Gazites were told,
JDG.16.3	 Samson spent half the night with the prostitute; then he got up in the middle of the night and left.
JDG.16.4	 After this Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the Sorek Valley. 
JDG.16.5	 The rulers of the Philistines went up to visit her and said to her, “Trick him! Find out what makes him so strong and how we can subdue him and humiliate
JDG.16.6	 So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me what makes you so strong and how you can be subdued and humiliated.”
JDG.16.7	 Samson said to her, “If they tie me up with seven fresh
JDG.16.8	 So the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried and they tied him up with them. 
JDG.16.9	 They hid
JDG.16.10	 Delilah said to Samson, “Look, you deceived
JDG.16.11	 He said to her, “If they tie me tightly with brand new ropes that have never been used,
JDG.16.12	 So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them and said to him, “The Philistines are here,
JDG.16.13	 Delilah said to Samson, “Up to now you have deceived me and told me lies. Tell me how you can be subdued.” He said to her, “If you weave the seven braids of my hair
JDG.16.14	 So she made him go to sleep, wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric on the loom, fastened it with the pin, and said to him, “The Philistines are here,
JDG.16.15	 She said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when you will not share your secret with me?
JDG.16.16	 She nagged him
JDG.16.17	 Finally he told her his secret.
JDG.16.18	 When Delilah saw that he had told her his secret,
JDG.16.19	 She made him go to sleep on her lap
JDG.16.20	 She said, “The Philistines are here,
JDG.16.21	 The Philistines captured him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him in bronze chains. He became a grinder in the prison. 
JDG.16.22	 His hair
JDG.16.23	 The rulers of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate. They said, “Our god has handed Samson, our enemy, over to us.” 
JDG.16.24	 When the people saw him,
JDG.16.25	 When they really started celebrating,
JDG.16.26	 Samson said to the young man who held his hand, “Position me so I can touch the pillars that support the temple.
JDG.16.27	 Now the temple
JDG.16.28	 Samson called to the 
JDG.16.29	 Samson took hold of the two middle pillars that supported the temple
JDG.16.30	 Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He pushed hard
JDG.16.31	 His brothers and all his family
JDG.17.1	 There was a man named Micah from the Ephraimite hill country. 
JDG.17.2	 He said to his mother, “You know
JDG.17.3	 When he gave back to his mother the eleven hundred pieces of silver, his mother said, “I solemnly dedicate
JDG.17.4	 When he gave the silver back to his mother, she
JDG.17.5	 Now this man Micah owned a shrine.
JDG.17.6	 In those days Israel had no king. Each man did what he considered to be right.
JDG.17.7	 There was a young man from Bethlehem
JDG.17.8	 This man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to find another place to live. He came to the Ephraimite hill country and made his way to Micah’s house.
JDG.17.9	 Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” He replied, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I am looking for a new place to live.”
JDG.17.10	 Micah said to him, “Stay with me. Become my adviser
JDG.17.11	 So the Levite agreed to stay with the man; the young man was like a son to Micah.
JDG.17.12	 Micah paid
JDG.17.13	 Micah said, “Now I know God will make me rich,
JDG.18.1	 In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the Danite tribe was looking for a place
JDG.18.2	 The Danites sent out from their whole tribe five representatives,
JDG.18.3	 As they approached
JDG.18.4	 He told them what Micah had done for him, saying,
JDG.18.5	 They said to him, “Seek a divine oracle for us,
JDG.18.6	 The priest said to them, “Go with confidence.
JDG.18.7	 So the five men journeyed on
JDG.18.8	 When the Danites returned to their tribe
JDG.18.9	 They said, “Come on, let’s attack them,
JDG.18.10	 When you invade,
JDG.18.11	 So six hundred Danites, fully armed, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.
JDG.18.12	 They went up and camped in Kiriath Jearim in Judah. (To this day that place is called Camp of Dan.
JDG.18.13	 From there they traveled through the Ephraimite hill country and arrived at Micah’s house. 
JDG.18.14	 The five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish
JDG.18.15	 They stopped
JDG.18.16	 Meanwhile the six hundred Danites, fully armed, stood at the entrance to the gate.
JDG.18.17	 The five men who had gone to spy out the land broke in and stole
JDG.18.18	 When these men broke into Micah’s house and stole
JDG.18.19	 They said to him, “Shut up! Put your hand over your mouth and come with us! You can be our adviser
JDG.18.20	 The priest was happy. He took the ephod, the personal idols, and the carved image and joined the group.
JDG.18.21	 They turned and went on their way, but they walked behind the children, the cattle, and their possessions.
JDG.18.22	 After they had gone a good distance from Micah’s house, Micah’s neighbors
JDG.18.23	 When they called out to the Danites, the Danites
JDG.18.24	 He said, “You stole my gods that I made, as well as this priest, and then went away. What do I have left? How can you have the audacity to say to me, ‘What do you want?’”
JDG.18.25	 The Danites said to him, “Don’t say another word to us, or some very angry men
JDG.18.26	 The Danites went on their way; when Micah realized
JDG.18.27	 Now the Danites
JDG.18.28	 No one came to the rescue because the city
JDG.18.29	 They named it Dan after their ancestor, who was one of Israel’s sons.
JDG.18.30	 The Danites worshiped
JDG.18.31	 They worshiped
JDG.19.1	 In those days Israel had no king. There was a Levite
JDG.19.2	 However, she
JDG.19.3	 her husband came
JDG.19.4	 His father-in-law, the girl’s father, persuaded him to stay with him for three days, and they ate and drank together, and spent the night there. 
JDG.19.5	 On the fourth day they woke up early and the Levite got ready to leave.
JDG.19.6	 So the two of them sat down and had a meal together.
JDG.19.7	 When the man got ready to leave,
JDG.19.8	 He woke up early in the morning on the fifth day so he could leave, but the girl’s father said, “Get some energy.
JDG.19.9	 When the man got ready to leave
JDG.19.10	 But the man did not want to stay another night. He left
JDG.19.11	 When they got near Jebus, it was getting quite late
JDG.19.12	 But his master said to him, “We should not stop at a foreign city where non-Israelites live.
JDG.19.13	 He said to his servant,
JDG.19.14	 So they traveled on,
JDG.19.15	 They stopped there and decided to spend the night
JDG.19.16	 But then an old man passed by, returning at the end of the day from his work in the field.
JDG.19.17	 When he looked up and saw the traveler
JDG.19.18	 The Levite
JDG.19.19	 We have enough straw and grain for our donkeys, and there is enough food and wine for me, your female servant,
JDG.19.20	 The old man said, “Everything is just fine!
JDG.19.21	 So he brought him to his house and fed the donkeys. They washed their feet and had a meal.
JDG.19.22	 They were having a good time,
JDG.19.23	 The man who owned the house went outside and said to them, “No, my brothers! Don’t do this wicked thing! After all, this man is a guest in my house. Don’t do such a disgraceful thing! 
JDG.19.24	 Here are my virgin daughter and my guest’s
JDG.19.25	 The men refused to listen to him, so the Levite
JDG.19.26	 The woman arrived back at daybreak and was sprawled out on the doorstep of the house where her master
JDG.19.27	 When her master
JDG.19.28	 He said to her, “Get up, let’s leave!” But there was no response. He put her on the donkey and went home.
JDG.19.29	 When he got home, he took a knife, grabbed his concubine, and carved her up into twelve pieces.
JDG.19.30	 Everyone who saw the sight
JDG.20.1	 All the Israelites from Dan to Beer Sheba
JDG.20.2	 The leaders
JDG.20.3	 The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah. Then the Israelites said, “Explain how this wicked thing happened!” 
JDG.20.4	 The Levite,
JDG.20.5	 The leaders of Gibeah attacked me and at night surrounded the house where I was staying.
JDG.20.6	 I grabbed hold of my concubine and carved her up and sent the pieces
JDG.20.7	 All you Israelites,
JDG.20.8	 All Israel rose up in unison
JDG.20.9	 Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: We will attack the city as the lot dictates.
JDG.20.10	 We will take ten of every group of a hundred men from all the tribes of Israel (and a hundred of every group of a thousand, and a thousand of every group of ten thousand) to get supplies for the army.
JDG.20.11	 So all the men of Israel gathered together at the city as allies.
JDG.20.12	 The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe
JDG.20.13	 Now, hand over the good-for-nothings
JDG.20.14	 The Benjaminites came from their cities and assembled at Gibeah
JDG.20.15	 That day the Benjaminites mustered from their cities twenty-six thousand sword-wielding soldiers, besides seven hundred well-trained soldiers from Gibeah.
JDG.20.16	 Among this army
JDG.20.17	 The men of Israel (not counting Benjamin) had mustered four hundred thousand sword-wielding soldiers, every one an experienced warrior.
JDG.20.18	 The Israelites went up to Bethel
JDG.20.19	 The Israelites got up the next morning and moved
JDG.20.20	 The men of Israel marched out to fight Benjamin; they
JDG.20.21	 The Benjaminites attacked from Gibeah and struck down twenty-two thousand Israelites that day.
JDG.20.22	 The Israelite army
JDG.20.23	 The Israelites went up and wept before the 
JDG.20.24	 So the Israelites marched toward
JDG.20.25	 The Benjaminites again attacked them from Gibeah and struck down eighteen thousand sword-wielding Israelite soldiers.
JDG.20.26	 So all the Israelites, the whole army,
JDG.20.27	 The Israelites asked the 
JDG.20.28	 Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, was serving the 
JDG.20.29	 So Israel hid men in ambush outside Gibeah. 
JDG.20.30	 The Israelites attacked the Benjaminites the next day;
JDG.20.31	 The Benjaminites attacked
JDG.20.32	 Then the Benjaminites said, “They are defeated just as before.” But the Israelites said, “Let’s retreat
JDG.20.33	 All the men of Israel got up from their places and took their positions at Baal Tamar, while the Israelites hiding in ambush jumped out of their places west of Gibeah. 
JDG.20.34	 Ten thousand men, well-trained soldiers from all Israel, then made a frontal assault against Gibeah – the battle was fierce.
JDG.20.35	 The 
JDG.20.36	 Then the Benjaminites saw they were defeated.
JDG.20.36	The Israelites retreated before
JDG.20.37	 The men hiding in ambush made a mad dash
JDG.20.38	 The Israelites and the men hiding in ambush had arranged a signal. When the men hiding in ambush
JDG.20.39	 the Israelites counterattacked.
JDG.20.40	 But when the signal, a pillar of smoke, began to rise up from the city, the Benjaminites turned around and saw the whole city going up in a cloud of smoke that rose high into the sky.
JDG.20.41	 When the Israelites turned around, the Benjaminites panicked
JDG.20.42	 They retreated before the Israelites, taking the road to the wilderness. But the battle overtook
JDG.20.43	 They surrounded the Benjaminites, chased them from Nohah,
JDG.20.44	 Eighteen thousand Benjaminites, all of them capable warriors, fell dead. 
JDG.20.45	 The rest
JDG.20.46	 That day twenty-five thousand
JDG.20.47	 Six hundred survivors turned and ran away to the wilderness, to the cliff of Rimmon. They stayed there four months. 
JDG.20.48	 The Israelites returned to the Benjaminite towns
JDG.21.1	 The Israelites had taken an oath in Mizpah, saying, “Not one of us will allow his daughter to marry a Benjaminite.” 
JDG.21.2	 So the people came to Bethel
JDG.21.3	 They said, “Why, O 
JDG.21.4	 The next morning the people got up early and built an altar there. They offered up burnt sacrifices and token of peace.
JDG.21.5	 The Israelites asked, “Who from all the Israelite tribes has not assembled before the 
JDG.21.6	 The Israelites regretted what had happened to
JDG.21.7	 How can we find wives for those who are left?
JDG.21.8	 So they asked, “Who from all the Israelite tribes did not assemble before the 
JDG.21.9	 When they took roll call,
JDG.21.10	 So the assembly sent 12,000 capable warriors
JDG.21.11	 Do this:
JDG.21.12	 They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young girls who were virgins – they had never had sexual relations with a male.
JDG.21.13	 The entire assembly sent messengers to the Benjaminites at the cliff of Rimmon and assured them they would not be harmed.
JDG.21.14	 The Benjaminites returned at that time, and the Israelites
JDG.21.15	 The people regretted what had happened to
JDG.21.16	 The leaders
JDG.21.17	 The
JDG.21.18	 But we can’t allow our daughters to marry them,
JDG.21.19	 However, there is an annual festival to the 
JDG.21.20	 So they commanded the Benjaminites, “Go hide in the vineyards, 
JDG.21.21	 and keep your eyes open.
JDG.21.22	 When their fathers or brothers come and protest to us,
JDG.21.23	 The Benjaminites did as instructed.
JDG.21.24	 Then the Israelites dispersed from there to their respective tribal and clan territories. Each went from there to his own property.
JDG.21.25	 In those days Israel had no king. Each man did what he considered to be right.
RUT.1.1	 During the time of the judges
RUT.1.2	 (Now the man’s name was Elimelech,
RUT.1.3	 Sometime later
RUT.1.4	 So her sons
RUT.1.5	 Then Naomi’s two sons, Mahlon and Kilion, also died.
RUT.1.6	 So she decided to return home from the region of Moab, accompanied by her daughters-in-law,
RUT.1.7	 Now as she and her two daughters-in-law began to leave the place where she had been living to return to the land of Judah,
RUT.1.8	 Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Listen to me! Each of you should return to your mother’s home!
RUT.1.9	 May the 
RUT.1.10	 But they said to her, “No!
RUT.1.11	 But Naomi replied, “Go back home, my daughters! There is no reason for you to return to Judah with me!
RUT.1.12	 Go back home, my daughters! For I am too old to get married again.
RUT.1.13	 surely you would not want to wait until they were old enough to marry!
RUT.1.14	 Again they wept loudly.
RUT.1.15	 So Naomi
RUT.1.16	 But Ruth replied, 
RUT.1.16	“Stop urging me to abandon you!
RUT.1.16	For wherever you go, I will go.
RUT.1.16	Wherever you live, I will live.
RUT.1.16	Your people will become my people,
RUT.1.16	and your God will become my God.
RUT.1.17	 Wherever you die, I will die – and there I will be buried.
RUT.1.17	May the 
RUT.1.17	Only death will be able to separate me from you!”
RUT.1.18	 When Naomi
RUT.1.19	 So the two of them
RUT.1.19	When they entered
RUT.1.20	 But she replied
RUT.1.21	 I left here full,
RUT.1.22	 So Naomi returned, accompanied by her Moabite daughter-in-law Ruth, who came back with her from the region of Moab.
RUT.2.1	 Now Naomi
RUT.2.2	 One day Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go
RUT.2.3	 So Ruth
RUT.2.4	 Now at that very moment,
RUT.2.5	 Boaz asked
RUT.2.6	 The servant in charge of the harvesters replied, “She’s the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the region of Moab. 
RUT.2.7	 She asked,
RUT.2.8	 So Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen carefully,
RUT.2.9	 Take note of

RUT.2.11	 Boaz replied to her,

RUT.2.16	 Make sure you pull out
RUT.2.17	 So she gathered grain in the field until evening. When she threshed
RUT.2.18	 She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw

RUT.2.22	 Naomi then said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, “It is good, my daughter, that you should go out to work with his female servants.
RUT.2.23	 So Ruth
RUT.3.1	 At that time,
RUT.3.2	 Now Boaz, with whose female servants you worked, is our close relative.
RUT.3.3	 So bathe yourself,
RUT.3.4	 When he gets ready to go to sleep,
RUT.3.5	 Ruth replied to Naomi,
RUT.3.6	 So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do.
RUT.3.7	 When Boaz had finished his meal and was feeling satisfied, he lay down to sleep at the far end of the grain heap.
RUT.3.8	 In the middle of the night he was startled
RUT.3.9	 He said, “Who are you?”
RUT.3.10	 He said, “May you be rewarded
RUT.3.11	 Now, my dear, don’t worry!
RUT.3.12	 Now yes, it is true that

RUT.3.14	 So she slept beside him
RUT.3.15	 Then he said, “Hold out the shawl
RUT.3.16	 and she returned to her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.16	When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi
RUT.3.17	 She said, “He gave me these sixty pounds of barley, for he said to me,
RUT.3.18	 Then Naomi
RUT.4.1	 Now Boaz went up
RUT.4.2	 Boaz chose ten of the village leaders
RUT.4.3	 Then Boaz said to the guardian,
RUT.4.4	 So I am legally informing you:

RUT.4.6	 The guardian said, “Then I am unable to redeem it, for I would ruin my own inheritance
RUT.4.7	 (Now this used to be the customary way to finalize a transaction involving redemption in Israel:
RUT.4.8	 So the guardian said to Boaz, “You may acquire it,” and he removed his sandal.
RUT.4.9	 Then Boaz said to the leaders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I have acquired from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	 I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, as my wife to raise up a descendant who will inherit his property
RUT.4.11	 All the people who were at the gate and the elders replied, “We are witnesses. May the 
RUT.4.12	 May your family

RUT.4.14	 The village women said to Naomi, “May the 
RUT.4.15	 He will encourage you and provide for you when you are old,
RUT.4.16	 Naomi took the child and placed him on her lap;
RUT.4.17	 The neighbor women named him, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi.” They named him Obed.
RUT.4.18	 These are the descendants
RUT.4.19	 Hezron was the father of Ram, Ram was the father of Amminadab, 
RUT.4.20	 Amminadab was the father of Nachshon, Nachshon was the father of Salmah, 
RUT.4.21	 Salmon

1SA.1.1	 There was a man from Ramathaim Zophim,
1SA.1.2	 He had two wives; the name of the first was Hannah and the name of the second was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah was childless. 
1SA.1.3	 Year after year
1SA.1.4	 Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he used to give meat portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. 
1SA.1.5	 But he would give a double

1SA.1.7	 Peninnah
1SA.1.8	 Finally her husband Elkanah said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep and not eat? Why are you so sad?
1SA.1.9	 On one occasion in Shiloh, after they had finished eating and drinking, Hannah got up.
1SA.1.10	 She was very upset

1SA.1.16	 Don’t consider your servant a wicked woman,
1SA.1.17	 Eli replied, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant the request that you have asked of him.” 
1SA.1.18	 She said, “May I, your servant, find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and got something to eat.
1SA.1.19	 They got up early the next morning and after worshiping the

1SA.1.23	 So her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what you think best.

1SA.1.24	 Once she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with three bulls, an ephah
1SA.1.25	 Once the bull had been slaughtered, they brought the boy to Eli. 
1SA.1.26	 She said, “Just as surely as you are alive, my lord, I am the woman who previously stood here with you in order to pray to the

1SA.2.1	“My heart rejoices in the 
1SA.2.1	my horn
1SA.2.1	I loudly denounce
1SA.2.1	for I am happy that you delivered me.
1SA.2.2	 No one is holy
1SA.2.2	There is no one other than you!
1SA.2.2	There is no rock
1SA.2.3	 Don’t keep speaking so arrogantly,
1SA.2.3	letting proud talk come out of your mouth!
1SA.2.3	For the 
1SA.2.3	he
1SA.2.4	 The bows of warriors are shattered,
1SA.2.4	but those who stumble find their strength reinforced.
1SA.2.5	 Those who are well-fed hire themselves out to earn food,
1SA.2.5	but the hungry no longer lack.

1SA.2.8	to seat them with princes

1SA.2.8	The foundations of the earth belong to the

1SA.2.9	 He watches over

1SA.2.11	 Then Elkanah went back home to Ramah. But the boy was serving the 
1SA.2.12	 The sons of Eli were wicked men.
1SA.2.13	 Now the priests would always treat the people in the following way:
1SA.2.14	 He would jab it into the basin, kettle, caldron, or pot, and everything that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they used to do to all the Israelites
1SA.2.15	 Even before they burned the fat, the priest’s attendant would come and say to the person who was making the sacrifice, “Hand over some meat for the priest to roast! He won’t take boiled meat from you, but only raw.”
1SA.2.16	 If the individual said to him, “First let the fat be burned away, and then take for yourself whatever you wish,” he would say, “No!
1SA.2.17	 The sin of these young men was very great in the 
1SA.2.18	 Now Samuel was ministering before the 
1SA.2.19	 His mother used to make him a small robe and bring it up to him at regular intervals when she would go up with her husband to make the annual sacrifice. 
1SA.2.20	 Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife saying, “May the 
1SA.2.21	 So the 
1SA.2.22	 Now Eli was very old when he heard about everything that his sons used to do to all the people of Israel
1SA.2.23	 He said to them, “Why do you behave in this way? For I hear about these evil things from all these
1SA.2.24	 This ought not to be,
1SA.2.25	 If a man sins against a man, one may appeal to God on his behalf. But if a man sins against the 
1SA.2.26	 Now the boy Samuel was growing up and finding favor both with the 
1SA.2.27	 A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the 
1SA.2.28	 I chose your ancestor
1SA.2.29	 Why are you
1SA.2.30	 Therefore the 
1SA.2.31	 In fact, days are coming when I will remove your strength
1SA.2.32	 You will see trouble in my dwelling place!
1SA.2.33	 Any one of you that I do not cut off from my altar, I will cause your
1SA.2.34	 This will be a confirming sign for you that will be fulfilled through your two sons,
1SA.2.35	 Then I will raise up for myself a faithful priest. He will do what is in my heart and soul. I will build for him a secure dynasty
1SA.2.36	 Everyone who remains in your house will come to bow before him for a little money
1SA.3.1	 Now the boy Samuel continued serving the 
1SA.3.2	 Eli’s eyes had begun to fail, so that he was unable to see well. At that time he was lying down in his place, 
1SA.3.3	 and the lamp of God had not yet been extinguished. Samuel was lying down in the temple of the 
1SA.3.4	 The 
1SA.3.5	 Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli
1SA.3.6	 The 
1SA.3.7	 Now Samuel did not yet know the 
1SA.3.8	 Then the 
1SA.3.9	 So Eli said to Samuel, “Go back and lie down. When he calls you, say, “Speak, 
1SA.3.10	 Then the 
1SA.3.11	 The 
1SA.3.12	 On that day I will carry out
1SA.3.13	 You
1SA.3.14	 Therefore I swore an oath to the house of Eli, ‘The sin of the house of Eli can never be forgiven by sacrifice or by grain offering.’”
1SA.3.15	 So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the 
1SA.3.16	 However, Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” He replied, “Here I am.” 
1SA.3.17	 Eli
1SA.3.18	 So Samuel told him everything. He did not hold back anything from him. Eli
1SA.3.19	 Samuel continued to grow, and the 
1SA.3.20	 All Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba realized that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the 
1SA.3.21	 Then the 
1SA.4.1	 Samuel revealed the word of the 
1SA.4.1	Then the Israelites went out to fight the Philistines.
1SA.4.2	 The Philistines arranged their forces to fight
1SA.4.3	 When the army
1SA.4.4	 So the army
1SA.4.5	 When the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.6	 When the Philistines heard the sound of the shout, they said, “What is this loud shout in the camp of the Hebrews?” Then they realized that the ark of the 
1SA.4.7	 The Philistines were scared because they thought that gods had come to the camp.
1SA.4.8	 Too bad for us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all sorts of plagues in the desert! 
1SA.4.9	 Be strong and act like men, you Philistines, or else you will wind up serving the Hebrews the way they have served you! Act like men and fight!” 
1SA.4.10	 So the Philistines fought. Israel was defeated; they all ran home.
1SA.4.11	 The ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, were killed. 
1SA.4.12	 On that day
1SA.4.13	 When he arrived in Shiloh, Eli was sitting in his chair watching by the side of
1SA.4.14	 When Eli heard the outcry,
1SA.4.15	 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes looked straight ahead;
1SA.4.16	 The man said to Eli, “I am the one who came from the battle lines! Just today I fled from the battle lines!” Eli
1SA.4.17	 The messenger replied, “Israel has fled from
1SA.4.18	 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli
1SA.4.19	 His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phineas, was pregnant and close to giving birth. When she heard that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she doubled over and gave birth. But her labor pains were too much for her. 
1SA.4.20	 As she was dying, the women who were there with her said, “Don’t be afraid! You have given birth to a son!” But she did not reply or pay any attention.
1SA.4.21	 She named the boy Ichabod,
1SA.4.22	 She said, “The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God has been captured.” 
1SA.5.1	 Now the Philistines had captured the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	 The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the temple of Dagon, where they positioned it beside Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	 When the residents of Ashdod got up early the next day,
1SA.5.4	 But when they got up early the following day, Dagon was again lying on the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.5	 (For this reason, to this very day, neither Dagon’s priests nor anyone else who enters Dagon’s temple step on Dagon’s threshold in Ashdod.) 
1SA.5.6	 The 
1SA.5.7	 When the people
1SA.5.8	 So they assembled
1SA.5.9	 But after it had been moved the 
1SA.5.10	 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. 
1SA.5.10	But when the ark of God arrived at Ekron, the residents of Ekron cried out saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel here
1SA.5.11	 So they assembled
1SA.5.12	 The people
1SA.6.1	 When the ark of the 
1SA.6.2	 the Philistines called the priests and the omen readers, saying, “What should we do with the ark of the 
1SA.6.3	 They replied, “If you are going to send the ark of
1SA.6.4	 They inquired, “What is the guilt offering that we should send to him?” 
1SA.6.4	They replied, “The Philistine leaders number five. So send five gold sores and five gold mice, for it is the same plague that has afflicted both you and your leaders. 
1SA.6.5	 You should make images of the sores and images of the mice
1SA.6.6	 Why harden your hearts like the Egyptians and Pharaoh did?
1SA.6.7	 So now go and make a new cart. Get two cows that have calves and that have never had a yoke placed on them. Harness the cows to the cart and take their calves from them back to their stalls. 
1SA.6.8	 Then take the ark of the 
1SA.6.9	 But keep an eye on it. If it should go up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has brought this great calamity on us. But if that is not the case, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us; rather, it just happened to us by accident.”
1SA.6.10	 So the men did as instructed.
1SA.6.11	 They put the ark of the 
1SA.6.12	 Then the cows went directly on the road to Beth Shemesh. They went along, mooing as they went; they turned neither to the right nor to the left. The leaders of the Philistines were walking along behind them all the way to the border of Beth Shemesh. 
1SA.6.13	 Now the residents of Beth Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the ark, they were pleased at the sight. 
1SA.6.14	 The cart was coming to the field of Joshua, who was from Beth Shemesh. It paused there near a big stone. Then they cut up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the 
1SA.6.15	 The Levites took down the ark of the 
1SA.6.16	 The five leaders of the Philistines watched what was happening and then returned to Ekron on the same day. 
1SA.6.17	 These are the gold sores that the Philistines brought as a guilt offering to the 
1SA.6.18	 The gold mice corresponded in number to all the Philistine cities of the five leaders, from the fortified cities to hamlet villages, to greater Abel,
1SA.6.19	 But the 
1SA.6.20	 The residents of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who is able to stand before the 
1SA.6.21	 So they sent messengers to the residents of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the 
1SA.7.1	 Then the people
1SA.7.2	 It was quite a long time – some twenty years in all – that the ark stayed at Kiriath Jearim. All the people
1SA.7.3	 Samuel said to all the people of Israel, “If you are really turning to the 
1SA.7.4	 So the Israelites
1SA.7.5	 Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the 
1SA.7.6	 After they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the 
1SA.7.7	 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the leaders of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the Israelites heard about this, they were afraid of the Philistines. 
1SA.7.8	 The Israelites said to Samuel, “Keep
1SA.7.9	 So Samuel took a nursing lamb
1SA.7.10	 As Samuel was offering burnt offerings, the Philistines approached to do battle with Israel.
1SA.7.11	 Then the men of Israel left Mizpah and chased the Philistines, striking them down all the way to an area below Beth Car.
1SA.7.12	 Samuel took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Shen.
1SA.7.13	 So the Philistines were defeated; they did not invade Israel again. The hand of the 
1SA.7.14	 The cities that the Philistines had captured from Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekron to Gath. Israel also delivered their territory from the control
1SA.7.15	 So Samuel led
1SA.7.16	 Year after year he used to travel the circuit of Bethel,
1SA.7.17	 Then he would return to Ramah, because his home was there. He also judged
1SA.8.1	 In his old age Samuel appointed his sons as judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	 The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beer Sheba. 
1SA.8.3	 But his sons did not follow
1SA.8.4	 So all the elders of Israel gathered together and approached Samuel at Ramah. 
1SA.8.5	 They said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons don’t follow your ways. So now appoint over us a king to lead
1SA.8.6	 But this request displeased Samuel, for
1SA.8.7	 The 
1SA.8.8	 Just as they have done
1SA.8.9	 So now do as they say.
1SA.8.10	 So Samuel spoke all the words of the 
1SA.8.11	 He said, “Here are the policies of the king who will rule over you: He will conscript your sons and put them in his chariot forces and in his cavalry; they will run in front of his chariot. 
1SA.8.12	 He will appoint for himself leaders of thousands and leaders of fifties,
1SA.8.13	 He will take your daughters to be ointment makers, cooks, and bakers. 
1SA.8.14	 He will take your best fields and vineyards and give them to his own servants. 
1SA.8.15	 He will demand a tenth of your seed and of the produce of your vineyards and give it to his administrators
1SA.8.16	 He will take your male and female servants, as well as your best cattle and your donkeys, and assign them for his own use. 
1SA.8.17	 He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will be his servants. 
1SA.8.18	 In that day you will cry out because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the 
1SA.8.19	 But the people refused to heed Samuel’s warning.
1SA.8.20	 We will be like all the other nations. Our king will judge us and lead us
1SA.8.21	 So Samuel listened to everything the people said and then reported it to the 
1SA.8.22	 The 
1SA.9.1	 There was a Benjaminite man named Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. He was a prominent person. 
1SA.9.2	 He had a son named Saul, a handsome young man. There was no one among the Israelites more handsome than he was; he stood head and shoulders above all the people.
1SA.9.3	 The donkeys of Saul’s father Kish wandered off,
1SA.9.4	 So Saul
1SA.9.5	 When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come on, let’s head back before my father quits worrying about the donkeys and becomes anxious about us!” 
1SA.9.6	 But the servant said to him, “Look, there is a man of God in this town. He is highly respected. Everything that he says really happens.
1SA.9.7	 So Saul said to his servant, “All right,
1SA.9.8	 The servant went on to answer Saul, “Look, I happen to have in my hand a quarter shekel
1SA.9.9	 (Now it used to be in Israel that whenever someone went to inquire of God he would say, “Come on, let’s go to the seer.” For today’s prophet used to be called a seer.) 
1SA.9.10	 So Saul said to his servant, “That’s a good idea!
1SA.9.11	 As they were going up the ascent to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water. They said to them, “Is this where the seer is?” 
1SA.9.12	 They replied, “Yes, straight ahead! But hurry now, for he came to the town today, and the people are making a sacrifice at the high place. 
1SA.9.13	 When you enter the town, you can find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people won’t eat until he arrives, for he must bless the sacrifice. Once that happens, those who have been invited will eat. Now go on up, for
1SA.9.14	 So they went up to the town. As they were heading for the middle of the town, Samuel was coming in their direction
1SA.9.15	 Now the day before Saul arrived, the 
1SA.9.16	 “At this time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin. You must consecrate
1SA.9.17	 When Samuel saw Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	 As Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate, he said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.” 
1SA.9.19	 Samuel replied to Saul, “I am the seer! Go up in front of me to the high place! Today you will eat with me and in the morning I will send you away. I will tell you everything that you are thinking.
1SA.9.20	 Don’t be concerned
1SA.9.21	 Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of Israel’s tribes, and is not my family clan the smallest of all the tribes of Benjamin? Why do you speak to me in this way?” 
1SA.9.22	 Then Samuel brought
1SA.9.23	 Samuel said to the cook, “Give me the portion of meat that I gave to you – the one I asked you to keep with you.”
1SA.9.24	 So the cook picked up the leg and brought it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel
1SA.9.25	 When they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof. 
1SA.9.26	 They got up at dawn and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up, so I can send you on your way.” So Saul got up and the two of them – he and Samuel – went outside. 
1SA.9.27	 While they were going down to the edge of town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” So he did.
1SA.10.1	 Then Samuel took a small container of olive oil and poured it on Saul’s
1SA.10.2	 When you leave me today, you will find two men near Rachel’s tomb at Zelzah on Benjamin’s border. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you have gone looking for have been found. Your father is no longer concerned about the donkeys but has become anxious about you two!
1SA.10.3	 “As you continue on from there, you will come to the tall tree of Tabor. At that point three men who are going up to God at Bethel
1SA.10.4	 They will ask you how you’re doing and will give you two loaves of bread. You will accept them. 
1SA.10.5	 Afterward you will go to Gibeah of God, where there are Philistine officials.
1SA.10.6	 Then the spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	 “When these signs have taken place, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God will be with you.
1SA.10.8	 You will go down to Gilgal before me. I am going to join you there to offer burnt offerings and to make peace offerings. You should wait for seven days, until I arrive and tell you what to do.” 
1SA.10.9	 As Saul
1SA.10.10	 When Saul and his servant
1SA.10.11	 When everyone who had known him previously saw him prophesying with the prophets, the people all asked one another, “What on earth has happened to the son of Kish? Does even Saul belong with the prophets?”
1SA.10.12	 A man who was from there replied, “And who is their father?” Therefore this became a proverb: “Is even Saul among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.13	 When Saul
1SA.10.14	 Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where did you go?” Saul
1SA.10.15	 Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”
1SA.10.16	 Saul said to his uncle, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But Saul
1SA.10.17	 Then Samuel called the people together before the 
1SA.10.18	 He said to the Israelites, “This is what the 
1SA.10.19	 But today you have rejected your God who saves you from all your trouble and distress. You have said, “No!
1SA.10.20	 Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen by lot. 
1SA.10.21	 Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the family of Matri was chosen by lot. At last Saul son of Kish was chosen by lot. But when they looked for him, he was nowhere to be found. 
1SA.10.22	 So they inquired again of the 
1SA.10.23	 So they ran and brought him from there. When he took his position among the people, he stood head and shoulders above them all. 
1SA.10.24	 Then Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one whom the 
1SA.10.25	 Then Samuel talked to the people about how the kingship would work.
1SA.10.26	 Even Saul went to his home in Gibeah. With him went some brave men whose hearts God had touched. 
1SA.10.27	 But some wicked men
1SA.11.1	 Nahash
1SA.11.2	 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “The only way I will make a treaty with you is if you let me gouge out the right eye of every one of you and in so doing humiliate all Israel!” 
1SA.11.3	 The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Leave us alone for seven days so that we can send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. If there is no one who can deliver us, we will come out voluntarily to you.” 
1SA.11.4	 When the messengers went to Gibeah (where Saul lived)
1SA.11.5	 Now Saul was walking behind the
1SA.11.6	 The Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and he became very angry. 
1SA.11.7	 He took a pair
1SA.11.8	 When Saul counted them at Bezek, the Israelites were 300,000
1SA.11.9	 They said to the messengers who had come, “Here’s what you should say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow deliverance will come to you when the sun is fully up.’” When the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh Gilead, they were happy. 
1SA.11.10	 The men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you
1SA.11.11	 The next day Saul placed the people in three groups. They went to the Ammonite camp during the morning watch and struck them
1SA.11.12	 Then the people said to Samuel, “Who were the ones asking, ‘Will Saul reign over us?’ Hand over those men so we may execute them!” 
1SA.11.13	 But Saul said, “No one will be killed on this day. For today the 
1SA.11.14	 Samuel said to the people, “Come on! Let’s go to Gilgal and renew the kingship there.” 
1SA.11.15	 So all the people went to Gilgal, where
1SA.12.1	 Samuel said to all Israel, “I have done
1SA.12.2	 Now look! This king walks before you. As for me, I am old and gray, though my sons are here with you. I have walked before you from the time of my youth till the present day. 
1SA.12.3	 Here I am. Bring a charge against me before the 
1SA.12.4	 They replied, “You have not wronged us or oppressed us. You have not taken anything from the hand of anyone.” 
1SA.12.5	 He said to them, “The 
1SA.12.6	 Samuel said to the people, “The 
1SA.12.7	 Now take your positions, so I may confront you
1SA.12.8	 When Jacob entered Egypt, your ancestors cried out to the 
1SA.12.9	 “But they forgot the 
1SA.12.10	 Then they cried out to the 
1SA.12.11	 So the 
1SA.12.12	 “When you saw that King Nahash of the Ammonites was advancing against you, you said to me, ‘No! A king will rule over us’ – even though the 
1SA.12.13	 Now look! Here is the king you have chosen – the one that you asked for! Look, the 
1SA.12.14	 If you fear the 
1SA.12.15	 But if you don’t obey
1SA.12.16	 “So now, take your positions and watch this great thing that the 
1SA.12.17	 Is this not the time of the wheat harvest? I will call on the 
1SA.12.18	 So Samuel called to the 
1SA.12.19	 All the people said to Samuel, “Pray to the 
1SA.12.20	 Then Samuel said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. You have indeed sinned.
1SA.12.21	 You should not turn aside after empty things that can’t profit and can’t deliver, since they are empty.
1SA.12.22	 The 
1SA.12.23	 As far as I am concerned, far be it from me to sin against the 
1SA.12.24	 However, fear the 
1SA.12.25	 But if you continue to do evil, both you and your king will be swept away.”
1SA.13.1	 Saul was [thirty]
1SA.13.2	 Saul selected for himself three thousand men from Israel. Two thousand of these were with Saul at Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel;
1SA.13.3	 Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost
1SA.13.4	 All Israel heard this message,
1SA.13.5	 For the battle with Israel the Philistines had amassed 3,000
1SA.13.6	 The men of Israel realized they had a problem because their army was hard pressed. So the army hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, strongholds,
1SA.13.7	 Some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan River
1SA.13.8	 He waited for seven days, the time period indicated by Samuel.
1SA.13.9	 So Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” Then he offered a burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	 Just when he had finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared on the scene. Saul went out to meet him and to greet him.
1SA.13.11	 But Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul replied, “When I saw that the army had started to abandon me
1SA.13.12	 I thought,
1SA.13.13	 Then Samuel said to Saul, “You have made a foolish choice! You have not obeyed
1SA.13.14	 But now your kingdom will not continue! The 
1SA.13.15	 Then Samuel set out and went up from Gilgal
1SA.13.16	 Saul, his son Jonathan, and the army that remained with them stayed in Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped in Micmash.
1SA.13.17	 Raiding bands went out from the camp of the Philistines in three groups. One band turned toward the road leading to Ophrah by the land of Shual; 
1SA.13.18	 another band turned toward the road leading to Beth Horon; and yet another band turned toward the road leading to the border that overlooks the valley of Zeboim in the direction of the desert. 
1SA.13.19	 A blacksmith could not be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, “This will prevent the Hebrews from making swords and spears.” 
1SA.13.20	 So all Israel had to go down to the Philistines in order to get their plowshares, cutting instruments, axes, and sickles
1SA.13.21	 They charged
1SA.13.22	 So on the day of the battle no sword or spear was to be found in the hand of anyone in the army that was with Saul and Jonathan. No one but Saul and his son Jonathan had them. 
1SA.13.23	 A garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash. 
1SA.14.1	 Then one day Jonathan son of Saul said to his armor bearer,
1SA.14.2	 Now Saul was sitting under a pomegranate tree in Migron, on the outskirts of Gibeah. The army that was with him numbered about six hundred men. 
1SA.14.3	 Now Ahijah was carrying
1SA.14.4	 Now there was a steep cliff on each side of the pass through which Jonathan intended to go to reach the Philistine garrison. One cliff was named Bozez, the other Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	 The cliff to the north was closer to Micmash, the one to the south closer to Geba. 
1SA.14.6	 Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come on, let’s go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the 
1SA.14.7	 His armor bearer said to him, “Do everything that is on your mind.
1SA.14.8	 Jonathan replied, “All right!
1SA.14.9	 If they say to us, ‘Stay put until we approach you,’ we will stay
1SA.14.10	 But if they say, ‘Come up against us,’ we will go up. For in that case the 
1SA.14.11	 When they
1SA.14.12	 Then the men of the garrison said to Jonathan and his armor bearer, “Come on up to us so we can teach you a thing or two!”
1SA.14.13	 Jonathan crawled up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer following behind him. Jonathan struck down the Philistines,
1SA.14.14	 In this initial skirmish Jonathan and his armor bearer struck down about twenty men in an area that measured half an acre.
1SA.14.15	 Then fear overwhelmed
1SA.14.16	 Saul’s watchmen at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin
1SA.14.17	 So Saul said to the army that was with him, “Muster the troops and see who is no longer with us.” When they mustered the troops,
1SA.14.18	 So Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring near the ephod,”
1SA.14.19	 While
1SA.14.20	 Saul and all the army that was with him assembled and marched into battle, where they found
1SA.14.21	 The Hebrews who had earlier gone over to the Philistine side
1SA.14.22	 When all the Israelites who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they too pursued them in battle. 
1SA.14.23	 So the 
1SA.14.24	 Now the men of Israel were hard pressed that day, for Saul had made the army agree to this oath: “Cursed be the man who eats food before evening! I will get my vengeance on my enemies!” So no one in the army ate anything. 
1SA.14.25	 Now the whole army
1SA.14.26	 When the army entered the forest, they saw
1SA.14.27	 But Jonathan had not heard about the oath his father had made the army take. He extended the end of his staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb. When he ate it,
1SA.14.28	 Then someone from the army informed him, “Your father put the army under a strict oath
1SA.14.29	 Then Jonathan said, “My father has caused trouble for the land. See how my eyes gleamed
1SA.14.30	 Certainly if the army had eaten some of the enemies’ provisions that they came across today, would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?” 
1SA.14.31	 On that day the army struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, and they became very tired. 
1SA.14.32	 So the army rushed greedily on
1SA.14.33	 Now it was reported to Saul, “Look, the army is sinning against the 
1SA.14.34	 Then Saul said, “Scatter out among the army and say to them, ‘Each of you bring to me your ox and sheep and slaughter them in this spot and eat. But don’t sin against the 
1SA.14.35	 Then Saul built an altar for the 
1SA.14.36	 Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines at night; we will rout
1SA.14.37	 So Saul asked God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him that day. 
1SA.14.38	 Then Saul said, “All you leaders of the army come here. Find out
1SA.14.39	 For as surely as the 
1SA.14.40	 Then he said to all Israel, “You will be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side.” The army replied to Saul, “Do whatever you think is best.”
1SA.14.41	 Then Saul said, “O 
1SA.14.42	 Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan!”
1SA.14.43	 So Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” Jonathan told him, “I used the end of the staff that was in my hand to taste a little honey. I must die!”
1SA.14.44	 Saul said, “God will punish me severely if Jonathan doesn’t die!”
1SA.14.45	 But the army said to Saul, “Should Jonathan, who won this great victory in Israel, die? May it never be! As surely as the 
1SA.14.46	 Then Saul stopped chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines went back home.
1SA.14.47	 After Saul had secured his royal position over Israel, he fought against all their
1SA.14.48	 He fought bravely, striking down the Amalekites and delivering Israel from the hand of its enemies.
1SA.14.49	 The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua.
1SA.14.50	 The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the general in command of his army was Abner son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.
1SA.14.51	 Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son
1SA.14.52	 There was fierce war with the Philistines all the days of Saul. So whenever Saul saw anyone who was a warrior or a brave individual, he would conscript him.
1SA.15.1	 Then Samuel said to Saul, “I was the one the 
1SA.15.2	 Here is what the 
1SA.15.3	 So go now and strike down the Amalekites. Destroy everything that they have. Don’t spare
1SA.15.4	 So Saul assembled
1SA.15.5	 Saul proceeded to the city
1SA.15.6	 Saul said to the Kenites, “Go on and leave! Go down from among the Amalekites! Otherwise I will sweep you away
1SA.15.7	 Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to
1SA.15.8	 He captured King Agag of the Amalekites alive, but he executed all Agag’s people
1SA.15.9	 However, Saul and the army spared Agag, along with the best of the flock, the cattle, the fatlings,
1SA.15.10	 Then the word of the 
1SA.15.11	 “I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from me and has not done what I told him to do.” Samuel became angry and he cried out to the 
1SA.15.12	 Then Samuel got up early to meet Saul the next morning. But Samuel was informed, “Saul has gone to Carmel where
1SA.15.13	 When Samuel came to him,
1SA.15.14	 Samuel replied, “If that is the case,
1SA.15.15	 Saul said, “They were brought
1SA.15.16	 Then Samuel said to Saul, “Wait a minute!
1SA.15.17	 Samuel said, “Is it not true that when you were insignificant in your own eyes, you became head of the tribes of Israel? The 
1SA.15.18	 The 
1SA.15.19	 Why haven’t you obeyed
1SA.15.20	 Then Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed
1SA.15.21	 But the army took from the plunder some of the sheep and cattle – the best of what was to be slaughtered – to sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.22	 Then Samuel said, 
1SA.15.22	“Does the 
1SA.15.22	as much as he does in obedience?
1SA.15.22	Certainly,
1SA.15.22	paying attention is better than
1SA.15.23	 For rebellion is like the sin of divination,
1SA.15.23	and presumption is like the evil of idolatry.
1SA.15.23	Because you have rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.23	he has rejected you as
1SA.15.24	 Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I have disobeyed what the 
1SA.15.25	 Now please forgive my sin! Go back with me so I can worship
1SA.15.26	 Samuel said to Saul, “I will not go back with you, for you have rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.27	 When Samuel turned to leave, Saul
1SA.15.28	 Samuel said to him, “The 
1SA.15.29	 The Preeminent One
1SA.15.30	 Saul
1SA.15.31	 So Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshiped the 
1SA.15.32	 Then Samuel said, “Bring me King Agag of the Amalekites.” So Agag came to him trembling,
1SA.15.33	 Samuel said, “Just as your sword left women childless, so your mother will be the most bereaved among women!” Then Samuel hacked Agag to pieces there in Gilgal before the 
1SA.15.34	 Then Samuel went to Ramah, while Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	 Until the day he
1SA.16.1	 The 
1SA.16.2	 Samuel replied, “How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me!” But the 
1SA.16.3	 Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you should do. You will anoint for me the one I point out
1SA.16.4	 Samuel did what the 
1SA.16.5	 He replied, “Yes, in peace. I have come to sacrifice to the 
1SA.16.6	 When they arrived, Samuel
1SA.16.7	 But the 
1SA.16.8	 Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel.
1SA.16.9	 Then Jesse presented
1SA.16.10	 Jesse presented seven of his sons to Samuel.
1SA.16.11	 Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Is that all of the young men?” Jesse
1SA.16.12	 So Jesse had him brought in.
1SA.16.13	 So Samuel took the horn full of olive oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers. The Spirit of the 
1SA.16.14	 Now the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	 Then Saul’s servants said to him, “Look, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you!” 
1SA.16.16	 Let our lord instruct his servants who are here before you to look for a man who knows how to play the lyre. Then whenever the evil spirit from God comes upon you, he can play the lyre
1SA.16.17	 So Saul said to his servants, “Find
1SA.16.18	 One of his attendants replied,
1SA.16.19	 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is out with the sheep. 
1SA.16.20	 So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a container of wine, and a young goat
1SA.16.21	 David came to Saul and stood before him. Saul liked him a great deal,
1SA.16.22	 Then Saul sent word to Jesse saying, “Let David be my servant, for I really like him.”
1SA.16.23	 So whenever the spirit from God would come upon Saul, David would take his lyre and play it. This would bring relief to Saul and make him feel better. Then the evil spirit would leave him alone.
1SA.17.1	 The Philistines gathered their troops
1SA.17.2	 Saul and the Israelite army
1SA.17.3	 The Philistines were standing on one hill, and the Israelites
1SA.17.4	 Then a champion
1SA.17.5	 He had a bronze helmet on his head and was wearing scale body armor. The weight of his bronze body armor was five thousand shekels.
1SA.17.6	 He had bronze shin guards
1SA.17.7	 The shaft
1SA.17.8	 Goliath
1SA.17.9	 If he is able to fight with me and strike me down, we will become your servants. But if I prevail against him and strike him down, you will become our servants and will serve us.” 
1SA.17.10	 Then the Philistine said, “I defy Israel’s troops this day! Give me a man so we can fight
1SA.17.11	 When Saul and all the Israelites
1SA.17.12	 Now David was the son of this Ephrathite named Jesse from Bethlehem
1SA.17.13	 Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to war. The names of the
1SA.17.14	 Now David was the youngest. While the three oldest sons followed Saul, 
1SA.17.15	 David was going back and forth
1SA.17.16	 Meanwhile for forty days the Philistine approached every morning and evening and took his position. 
1SA.17.17	 Jesse said to his son David, “Take your brothers this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread; go quickly
1SA.17.18	 Also take these ten portions of cheese to their commanding officer.
1SA.17.19	 They are with Saul and the whole Israelite army
1SA.17.20	 So David got up early in the morning and entrusted the flock to someone else who would watch over it.
1SA.17.21	 Israel and the Philistines drew up their battle lines opposite one another. 
1SA.17.22	 After David had entrusted his cargo to the care of the supply officer,
1SA.17.23	 As he was speaking with them, the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, was coming up from the battle lines of the Philistines. He spoke the way he usually did,
1SA.17.24	 When all the men of Israel saw this man, they retreated
1SA.17.25	 The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who is coming up? He does so
1SA.17.26	 David asked the men who were standing near him, “What will be done for the man who strikes down this Philistine and frees Israel from this humiliation?
1SA.17.27	 The soldiers
1SA.17.28	 When David’s
1SA.17.29	 David replied, “What have I done now? Can’t I say anything?”
1SA.17.30	 Then he turned from those who were nearby to someone else and asked the same question,
1SA.17.31	 When David’s words were overheard and reported to Saul, he called for him.
1SA.17.32	 David said to Saul, “Don’t let anyone be discouraged.
1SA.17.33	 But Saul replied to David, “You aren’t able to go against this Philistine and fight him! You’re just a boy! He has been a warrior from his youth!”
1SA.17.34	 David replied to Saul, “Your servant has been a shepherd for his father’s flock. Whenever a lion or bear would come and carry off a sheep from the flock, 
1SA.17.35	 I would go out after it, strike it down, and rescue the sheep from its mouth. If it rose up against me, I would grab it by its jaw, strike it, and kill it. 
1SA.17.36	 Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be just like one of them.
1SA.17.37	 David went on to say, “The 
1SA.17.38	 Then Saul clothed David with his own fighting attire and put a bronze helmet on his head. He also put body armor on him. 
1SA.17.39	 David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire and tried to walk around, but he was not used to them.
1SA.17.40	 He took his staff in his hand, picked out five smooth stones from the stream, placed them in the pouch
1SA.17.41	 The Philistine kept coming closer to David, with his shield bearer walking in front of him. 
1SA.17.42	 When the Philistine looked carefully at David, he despised him, for he was only a ruddy and handsome boy. 
1SA.17.43	 The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you are coming after me with sticks?”
1SA.17.44	 The Philistine said to David, “Come here to me, so I can give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the field!”
1SA.17.45	 But David replied to the Philistine, “You are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin. But I am coming against you in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	 This very day the 
1SA.17.47	 and all this assembly will know that it is not by sword or spear that the 
1SA.17.48	 The Philistine drew steadily closer to David to attack him, while David quickly ran toward the battle line to attack the Philistine.
1SA.17.49	 David reached his hand into the bag and took out a stone. He slung it, striking the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank deeply into his forehead, and he fell down with his face to the ground. 
1SA.17.50	 David prevailed over the Philistine with just the sling and the stone. He struck down the Philistine and killed him. David did not even have a sword in his hand.
1SA.17.51	 David ran and stood over the Philistine. He grabbed Goliath’s
1SA.17.52	 Then the men of Israel and Judah charged forward, shouting a battle cry.
1SA.17.53	 When the Israelites returned from their hot pursuit of the Philistines, they looted their camp. 
1SA.17.54	 David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem,
1SA.17.55	 Now as Saul watched David going out to fight the Philistine, he asked Abner, the general in command of the army, “Whose son is this young man, Abner?” Abner replied, “As surely as you live, O king, I don’t know.” 
1SA.17.56	 The king said, “Find out whose son this boy is!” 
1SA.17.57	 So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. He still had the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
1SA.17.58	 Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” David replied, “I am the son of your servant Jesse in Bethlehem.”
1SA.18.1	 When David
1SA.18.2	 Saul retained David
1SA.18.3	 Jonathan made a covenant with David, for he loved him as much as he did his own life.
1SA.18.4	 Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with the rest of his gear, including his sword, his bow, and even his belt.
1SA.18.5	 On every mission on which Saul sent him, David achieved success. So Saul appointed him over the men of war. This pleased not only all the army, but also Saul’s servants.
1SA.18.6	 When the men
1SA.18.7	 The women who were playing the music sang,
1SA.18.7	“Saul has struck down his thousands,
1SA.18.7	but David his tens of thousands!”
1SA.18.8	 This made Saul very angry. The statement displeased him and he thought,
1SA.18.9	 So Saul was keeping an eye on David from that day onward. 
1SA.18.10	 The next day an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul and he prophesied within his house. Now David was playing the lyre
1SA.18.11	 and Saul threw the spear, thinking, “I’ll nail David to the wall!” But David escaped from him on two different occasions.
1SA.18.12	 So Saul feared David, because the 
1SA.18.13	 Saul removed David
1SA.18.14	 Now David achieved success in all he did,
1SA.18.15	 When Saul saw how very successful he was, he was afraid of him. 
1SA.18.16	 But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he was the one leading them out to battle and back.
1SA.18.17	 Then Saul said to David, “Here’s my oldest daughter, Merab. I want to give her to you in marriage. Only be a brave warrior
1SA.18.18	 David said to Saul, “Who am I? Who are my relatives or the clan of my father
1SA.18.19	 When the time came for Merab, Saul’s daughter, to be given to David, she instead was given in marriage to Adriel, who was from Meholah.
1SA.18.20	 Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David. When they told Saul about this, it
1SA.18.21	 Saul said, “I will give her to him so that she may become a snare to him and the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “Today is the second time for you to become my son-in-law.”
1SA.18.22	 Then Saul instructed his servants, “Tell David secretly, ‘The king is pleased with you, and all his servants like you. So now become the king’s son-in-law.” 
1SA.18.23	 So Saul’s servants spoke these words privately
1SA.18.24	 When Saul’s servants reported what David had said, 
1SA.18.25	 Saul replied, “Here is what you should say to David: ‘There is nothing that the king wants as a price for the bride except a hundred Philistine foreskins, so that he can be avenged of his
1SA.18.26	 So his servants told David these things and David agreed
1SA.18.27	 when David, along with his men, went out
1SA.18.28	 When Saul realized
1SA.18.29	 Saul became even more afraid of him.
1SA.18.30	 Then the leaders of the Philistines would march out, and as often as they did so, David achieved more success than all of Saul’s servants. His name was held in high esteem.
1SA.19.1	 Then Saul told his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David. But Saul’s son Jonathan liked David very much.
1SA.19.2	 So Jonathan told David, “My father Saul is trying
1SA.19.3	 I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are. I will speak about you to my father. When I find out what the problem is,
1SA.19.4	 So Jonathan spoke on David’s behalf
1SA.19.5	 He risked his life
1SA.19.6	 Saul accepted Jonathan’s advice
1SA.19.7	 Then Jonathan called David and told him all these things. Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he served him as he had done formerly.
1SA.19.8	 Now once again there was war. So David went out to fight the Philistines. He defeated them thoroughly
1SA.19.9	 Then an evil spirit from the 
1SA.19.10	 Saul tried to nail David to the wall with the spear, but he escaped from Saul’s presence and the spear drove into the wall.
1SA.19.11	 Saul sent messengers to David’s house to guard it and to kill him in the morning. Then David’s wife Michal told him, “If you do not save yourself
1SA.19.12	 So Michal lowered David through the window, and he ran away and escaped.
1SA.19.13	 Then Michal took a household idol
1SA.19.14	 When Saul sent messengers to arrest David, she said, “He’s sick.” 
1SA.19.15	 Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me on his bed so I can kill him.” 
1SA.19.16	 When the messengers came, they found only the idol on the bed and the quilt made of goat’s hair at its head.
1SA.19.17	 Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me this way by sending my enemy away? Now he has escaped!” Michal replied to Saul, “He said to me, ‘Help me get away or else I will kill you!’”
1SA.19.18	 Now David had run away and escaped. He went to Samuel in Ramah and told him everything that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed at Naioth. 
1SA.19.19	 It was reported to Saul saying, “David is at Naioth in Ramah.” 
1SA.19.20	 So Saul sent messengers to capture David. When they saw a company of prophets prophesying with Samuel standing there as their leader, the spirit of God came upon Saul’s messengers, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.21	 When it was reported to Saul, he sent more messengers, but they prophesied too. So Saul sent messengers a third time, but they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.22	 Finally Saul
1SA.19.23	 So Saul went to Naioth in Ramah. The Spirit of God came upon him as well, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
1SA.19.24	 He even stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He lay there
1SA.20.1	 David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and asked,
1SA.20.2	 Jonathan
1SA.20.3	 Taking an oath, David again
1SA.20.4	 Jonathan replied to David, “Tell me what I can do for you.”
1SA.20.5	 David said to Jonathan, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and I am certainly expected to join the king for a meal.
1SA.20.6	 If your father happens to miss me, you should say, ‘David urgently requested me to let him go
1SA.20.7	 If he should then say, ‘That’s fine,’
1SA.20.8	 You must be loyal
1SA.20.9	 Jonathan said, “Far be it from you to suggest this! If I were at all aware that my father had decided to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you about it?” 
1SA.20.10	 David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” 
1SA.20.11	 Jonathan said to David, “Come on. Let’s go out to the field.”
1SA.20.11	When the two of them had gone out into the field, 
1SA.20.12	 Jonathan said to David, “The 
1SA.20.13	 But if my father intends to do you harm, may the 
1SA.20.14	 While I am still alive, extend to me the loyalty of the 
1SA.20.15	 Don’t ever cut off your loyalty to my family, not even when the 
1SA.20.16	 and called David’s enemies to account.” So Jonathan made a covenant
1SA.20.17	 Jonathan once again took an oath with David, because he loved him. In fact Jonathan loved him as much as he did his own life.
1SA.20.18	 Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, for your seat will be empty. 
1SA.20.19	 On the third day
1SA.20.20	 I will shoot three arrows near it, as though I were shooting at a target. 
1SA.20.21	 When I send a boy after them, I will say, “Go and find the arrows.” If I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you;
1SA.20.22	 But if I say to the boy, “Look, the arrows are on the other side of you,’
1SA.20.23	 With regard to the matter that you and I discussed, the 
1SA.20.24	 So David hid in the field. When the new moon came, the king sat down to eat his meal. 
1SA.20.25	 The king sat down in his usual place by the wall, with Jonathan opposite him
1SA.20.26	 However, Saul said nothing about it
1SA.20.27	 But the next morning, the second day of the new moon, David’s place was still vacant. So Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why has Jesse’s son not come to the meal yesterday or today?” 
1SA.20.28	 Jonathan replied to Saul, “David urgently requested that he be allowed to go to Bethlehem. 
1SA.20.29	 He said, ‘Permit me to go,
1SA.20.30	 Saul became angry with Jonathan
1SA.20.31	 For as long as
1SA.20.32	 Jonathan responded to his father Saul, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” 
1SA.20.33	 Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan
1SA.20.34	 Jonathan got up from the table enraged. He did not eat any food on that second day of the new moon, for he was upset that his father had humiliated David.
1SA.20.35	 The next morning Jonathan, along with a young servant, went out to the field to meet David. 
1SA.20.36	 He said to his servant, “Run, find the arrows that I am about to shoot.” As the servant ran, Jonathan
1SA.20.37	 When the servant came to the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow, Jonathan called out to
1SA.20.38	 Jonathan called out to the servant, “Hurry! Go faster! Don’t delay!” Jonathan’s servant retrieved the arrow and came back to his master. 
1SA.20.39	 (Now the servant did not understand any of this. Only Jonathan and David knew what was going on.)
1SA.20.40	 Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the servant who was with him. He said to him, “Go, take these things back to the city.”
1SA.20.41	 When the servant had left, David got up from beside the mound,
1SA.20.42	 Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for the two of us have sworn together in the name of the 
1SA.21.2	 David replied to Ahimelech the priest, “The king instructed me to do something, but he said to me, ‘Don’t let anyone know the reason I am sending you or the instructions I have given you.’
1SA.21.3	 Now what do you have at your disposal?
1SA.21.4	 The priest replied to David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread at my disposal. Only holy bread is available, and then only if your soldiers
1SA.21.5	 David said to the priest, “Certainly women have been kept away from us, just as on previous occasions when I have set out. The soldiers’
1SA.21.6	 So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there other than the bread of the Presence. It had been removed from before the 
1SA.21.7	 (One of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the 
1SA.21.8	 David said to Ahimelech, “Is there no sword or spear here at your disposal? I don’t have my own sword or equipment in hand due to the urgency of the king’s instructions.”
1SA.21.9	 The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the valley of Elah, is wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish, take it for yourself. Other than that, there’s nothing here.” David said, “There’s nothing like it! Give it to me!” 
1SA.21.10	 So on that day David arose and fled from Saul. He went to King Achish of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	 The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one that they sing about when they dance, saying,
1SA.21.11	‘Saul struck down his thousands,
1SA.21.11	But David his tens of thousands’?”
1SA.21.12	 David thought about what they said
1SA.21.13	 He altered his behavior in their presence.
1SA.21.14	 Achish said to his servants, “Look at this madman! Why did you bring him to me? 
1SA.21.15	 Do I have a shortage of fools, that you have brought me this man to display his insanity in front of me? Should this man enter my house?”
1SA.22.1	 So David left there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and the rest of his father’s family
1SA.22.2	 All those who were in trouble or owed someone money or were discontented
1SA.22.3	 Then David went from there to Mizpah in Moab, where he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother stay
1SA.22.4	 So he had them stay with the king of Moab; they stayed with him the whole time
1SA.22.5	 Then Gad the prophet said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold. Go to the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
1SA.22.6	 But Saul found out the whereabouts of David and the men who were with him.
1SA.22.7	 Saul said to his servants who were stationed around him, “Listen up, you Benjaminites! Is Jesse’s son giving fields and vineyards to all of you? Or is he making all of you
1SA.22.8	 For all of you have conspired against me! No one informs me
1SA.22.9	 But Doeg the Edomite, who had stationed himself with the servants of Saul, replied, “I saw this son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob. 
1SA.22.10	 He inquired of the 
1SA.22.11	 Then the king arranged for a meeting with the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and all the priests of his father’s house who were at Nob. They all came to the king. 
1SA.22.12	 Then Saul said, “Listen, son of Ahitub.” He replied, “Here I am, my lord.” 
1SA.22.13	 Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and this son of Jesse? You gave
1SA.22.14	 Ahimelech replied to the king, “Who among all your servants is faithful like David? He is the king’s son-in-law, the leader of your bodyguard, and honored in your house! 
1SA.22.15	 Was it just today that I began to inquire of God on his behalf? Far be it from me! The king should not accuse
1SA.22.16	 But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house! 
1SA.22.17	 Then the king said to the messengers
1SA.22.18	 Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests. He killed on that day eighty-five
1SA.22.19	 As for Nob, the city of the priests, he struck down with the sword men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep – all with the sword.
1SA.22.20	 But one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped and fled to David. His name was Abiathar. 
1SA.22.21	 Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the 
1SA.22.22	 Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would certainly tell Saul! I am guilty
1SA.22.23	 Stay with me. Don’t be afraid! Whoever
1SA.23.1	 They told David, “The Philistines are fighting in Keilah and are looting the threshing floors.” 
1SA.23.2	 So David asked the 
1SA.23.3	 But David’s men said to him, “We are afraid while we are still here in Judah! What will it be like if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?” 
1SA.23.4	 So David asked the 
1SA.23.5	 So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines. He took away their cattle and thoroughly defeated them.
1SA.23.6	 Now when Abiathar son of Ahimelech had fled to David at Keilah, he had brought with him an ephod.
1SA.23.7	 When Saul was told that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, “God has delivered
1SA.23.8	 So Saul mustered all his army to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men.
1SA.23.9	 When David realized that Saul was planning to harm him,
1SA.23.10	 Then David said, “O 
1SA.23.11	 Will the leaders of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O 
1SA.23.11	Then the 
1SA.23.12	 David asked, “Will the leaders of Keilah deliver me and my men into Saul’s hand?” The 
1SA.23.13	 So David and his men, who numbered about six hundred, set out and left Keilah; they moved around from one place to another.
1SA.23.14	 David stayed in the strongholds that were in the desert and in the hill country of the desert of Ziph. Saul looked for him all the time,
1SA.23.15	 David realized
1SA.23.16	 Then Jonathan son of Saul left and went to David at Horesh. He encouraged him
1SA.23.17	 He said to him, “Don’t be afraid! For the hand of my father Saul cannot find you. You will rule over Israel, and I will be your second in command. Even my father Saul realizes this.” 
1SA.23.18	 When the two of them had made a covenant before the 
1SA.23.19	 Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Isn’t David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon? 
1SA.23.20	 Now at your own discretion,
1SA.23.21	 Saul replied, “May you be blessed by the 
1SA.23.22	 Go and make further arrangements. Determine precisely
1SA.23.23	 Locate precisely all the places where he hides and return to me with dependable information.
1SA.23.24	 So they left and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the desert of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.25	 Saul and his men went to look for him.
1SA.23.26	 Saul went on one side of the mountain, while David and his men went on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, but Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men so they could capture them. 
1SA.23.27	 But a messenger came to Saul saying, “Come quickly, for the Philistines have raided the land!”
1SA.23.28	 So Saul stopped pursuing David and went to confront the Philistines. Therefore that place is called Sela Hammahlekoth.
1SA.24.2	 So Saul took three thousand select men from all Israel and went to find
1SA.24.3	 He came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there was a cave. Saul went into it to relieve himself.
1SA.24.3	Now David and his men were sitting in the recesses of the cave. 
1SA.24.4	 David’s men said to him, “This is the day about which the 
1SA.24.5	 Afterward David’s conscience bothered him
1SA.24.6	 He said to his men, “May the 
1SA.24.7	 David restrained his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and started down
1SA.24.8	 Afterward David got up and went out of the cave. He called out after Saul, “My lord, O king!” When Saul looked behind him, David kneeled down and bowed with his face to the ground. 
1SA.24.9	 David said to Saul, “Why do you pay attention when men say, ‘David is seeking to do you harm’? 
1SA.24.10	 Today your own eyes see how the 
1SA.24.11	 Look, my father, and see the edge of your robe in my hand! When I cut off the edge of your robe, I didn’t kill you. So realize and understand that I am not planning
1SA.24.12	 May the 
1SA.24.13	 It’s like the old proverb says: ‘From evil people evil proceeds.’ But my hand will not be against you. 
1SA.24.14	 Who has the king of Israel come out after? Who is it that you are pursuing? A dead dog? A single flea? 
1SA.24.15	 May the 
1SA.24.16	 When David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” Then Saul wept loudly.
1SA.24.17	 He said to David, “You are more innocent
1SA.24.18	 You have explained today how you have treated me well. The 
1SA.24.19	 Now if a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way in good shape? May the 
1SA.24.20	 Now look, I realize that you will in fact be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. 
1SA.24.21	 So now swear to me in the 
1SA.24.22	 David promised Saul this on oath.
1SA.25.1	 Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David left and went down to the desert of Paran.
1SA.25.2	 There was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. This man was very wealthy;
1SA.25.3	 The man’s name was Nabal,
1SA.25.4	 When David heard in the desert that Nabal was shearing his sheep, 
1SA.25.5	 he
1SA.25.6	 Then you will say to my brother,
1SA.25.7	 Now I hear that they are shearing sheep for you. When your shepherds were with us, we neither insulted them nor harmed them the whole time they were in Carmel. 
1SA.25.8	 Ask your own servants; they can tell you! May my servants find favor in your sight, for we have come
1SA.25.9	 So David’s servants went and spoke all these words to Nabal in David’s name. Then they paused. 
1SA.25.10	 But Nabal responded to David’s servants, “Who is David, and who is this son of Jesse? This is a time when many servants are breaking away from their masters! 
1SA.25.11	 Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers and give them to these men? I don’t even know where they came from!”
1SA.25.12	 So David’s servants went on their way. When they had returned, they came and told David
1SA.25.13	 Then David instructed his men, “Each of you strap on your sword!” So each one strapped on his sword, and David also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men followed David up, while two hundred stayed behind with the equipment.
1SA.25.14	 But one of the servants told Nabal’s wife Abigail, “David sent messengers from the desert to greet
1SA.25.15	 These men were very good to us. They did not insult us, nor did we sustain any loss during the entire time we were together
1SA.25.16	 Both night and day they were a protective wall for us the entire time we were with them, while we were tending our flocks. 
1SA.25.17	 Now be aware of this, and see what you can do. For disaster has been planned for our lord and his entire household.
1SA.25.18	 So Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread, two containers
1SA.25.19	 and said to her servants, “Go on ahead of me. I will come after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
1SA.25.20	 Riding on her donkey, she went down under cover of the mountain. David and his men were coming down to meet her, and she encountered them. 
1SA.25.21	 Now David had been thinking,
1SA.25.22	 God will severely punish David,
1SA.25.23	 When Abigail saw David, she got down quickly from the donkey, threw herself down before David, and bowed to the ground. 
1SA.25.24	 Falling at his feet, she said, “My lord, I accept all the guilt! But please let your female servant speak with my lord! Please listen to the words of your servant! 
1SA.25.25	 My lord should not pay attention to this wicked man Nabal. He simply lives up to his name! His name means ‘fool,’ and he is indeed foolish!
1SA.25.26	 “Now, my lord, as surely as the 
1SA.25.27	 Now let this present
1SA.25.28	 Please forgive the sin of your servant, for the 
1SA.25.29	 When someone sets out to chase you and to take your life, the life of my lord will be wrapped securely in the bag
1SA.25.30	 The 
1SA.25.31	 Your conscience will not be overwhelmed with guilt
1SA.25.32	 Then David said to Abigail, “Praised
1SA.25.33	 Praised be your good judgment! May you yourself be rewarded
1SA.25.34	 Otherwise, as surely as the 
1SA.25.35	 Then David took from her hand what she had brought to him. He said to her, “Go back
1SA.25.36	 When Abigail went back to Nabal, he was holding a banquet in his house like that of the king. Nabal was having a good time
1SA.25.37	 In the morning, when Nabal was sober,
1SA.25.38	 After about ten days the 
1SA.25.39	 When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, “Praised be the 
1SA.25.40	 So the servants of David went to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, “David has sent us to you to bring you back to be his wife.” 
1SA.25.41	 She arose, bowed her face toward the ground, and said, “Your female servant, like a lowly servant, will wash
1SA.25.42	 Then Abigail quickly went and mounted her donkey, with five of her female servants accompanying her.
1SA.25.43	 David had also married
1SA.25.44	 (Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.)
1SA.26.1	 The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Isn’t David hiding on the hill of Hakilah near
1SA.26.2	 So Saul arose and 
1SA.26.2	went down to the desert of Ziph, accompanied by three thousand select men of Israel, to look for David in the desert of Ziph. 
1SA.26.3	 Saul camped by the road on the hill of Hakilah near Jeshimon, but David was staying in the desert. When he realized that Saul had come to the desert to find
1SA.26.4	 David sent scouts and verified that Saul had indeed arrived.
1SA.26.5	 So David set out and went to the place where Saul was camped. David saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general in command of his army, were sleeping. Now Saul was lying in the entrenchment, and the army was camped all around him. 
1SA.26.6	 David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” Abishai replied, “I will go down with you.”
1SA.26.7	 So David and Abishai approached the army at night and found Saul lying asleep in the entrenchment with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. Abner and the army were lying all around him. 
1SA.26.8	 Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me drive the spear
1SA.26.9	 But David said to Abishai, “Don’t kill him! Who can extend his hand against the 
1SA.26.10	 David went on to say, “As the 
1SA.26.11	 But may the 
1SA.26.12	 So David took the spear and the jug of water by Saul’s head, and they got out of there. No one saw them or was aware of their presence or woke up. All of them were asleep, for the 
1SA.26.13	 Then David crossed to the other side and stood on the top of the hill some distance away; there was a considerable distance between them. 
1SA.26.14	 David called to the army and to Abner son of Ner, “Won’t you answer, Abner?” Abner replied, “Who are you, that you have called to the king?” 
1SA.26.15	 David said to Abner, “Aren’t you a man? After all, who is like you in Israel? Why then haven’t you protected your lord the king? One of the soldiers came to kill your lord the king. 
1SA.26.16	 This failure on your part isn’t good!
1SA.26.17	 When Saul recognized David’s voice, he said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” David replied, “Yes, it’s my voice, my lord the king.” 
1SA.26.18	 He went on to say, “Why is my lord chasing his servant? What have I done? What wrong have I done?
1SA.26.19	 So let my lord the king now listen to the words of his servant. If the 
1SA.26.20	 Now don’t let my blood fall to the ground away from the 
1SA.26.21	 Saul replied, “I have sinned. Come back, my son David. I won’t harm you, for you treated my life with value
1SA.26.22	 David replied, “Here is the king’s spear! Let one of your servants cross over and get it. 
1SA.26.23	 The 
1SA.26.24	 In the same way that I valued your life this day,
1SA.26.25	 Saul replied to David, “May you be rewarded,
1SA.27.1	 David thought to himself,
1SA.27.2	 So David left and crossed over to King Achish son of Maoch of Gath accompanied by his six hundred men. 
1SA.27.3	 David settled with Achish in Gath, along with his men and their families.
1SA.27.4	 When Saul learned that David had fled to Gath, he did not mount a new search for him.
1SA.27.5	 David said to Achish, “If I have found favor with you, let me be given a place in one of the country towns so that I can live there. Why should your servant settle in the royal city with you?” 
1SA.27.6	 So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (For that reason Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this very day.) 
1SA.27.7	 The length of time
1SA.27.8	 Then David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (They had been living in that land for a long time, from the approach
1SA.27.9	 When David would attack a district,
1SA.27.10	 When Achish would ask, “Where
1SA.27.11	 Neither man nor woman would David leave alive so as to bring them back to Gath. He was thinking, “This way they can’t tell on us, saying, ‘This is what David did.’” Such was his practice the entire time
1SA.27.12	 So Achish trusted David, thinking to himself,
1SA.28.1	 In those days the Philistines gathered their troops
1SA.28.2	 David replied to Achish, “That being the case, you will come to know what your servant can do!” Achish said to David, “Then I will make you my bodyguard
1SA.28.3	 Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented over him and had buried him in Ramah, his hometown.
1SA.28.4	 The Philistines assembled; they came and camped at Shunem. Saul mustered all Israel and camped at Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	 When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was absolutely terrified.
1SA.28.6	 So Saul inquired of the 
1SA.28.7	 So Saul instructed his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium,
1SA.28.8	 So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing and left, accompanied by two of his men. They came to the woman at night and said, “Use your ritual pit to conjure up for me the one I tell you.”
1SA.28.9	 But the woman said to him, “Look, you are aware of what Saul has done; he has removed
1SA.28.10	 But Saul swore an oath to her by the 
1SA.28.11	 The woman replied, “Who is it that I should bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up for me Samuel.”
1SA.28.12	 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out loudly.
1SA.28.13	 The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid! What have you seen?” The woman replied to Saul, “I have seen one like a god
1SA.28.14	 He said to her, “What about his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up! He is wrapped in a robe!”
1SA.28.14	Then Saul realized it was Samuel, and he bowed his face toward the ground and kneeled down. 
1SA.28.15	 Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul replied, “I am terribly troubled! The Philistines are fighting against me and God has turned away from me. He does not answer me – not by the prophets nor by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what I should do.”
1SA.28.16	 Samuel said, “Why are you asking me, now that the 
1SA.28.17	 The 
1SA.28.18	 Since you did not obey the 
1SA.28.19	 The 
1SA.28.20	 Saul quickly fell full length on the ground and was very afraid because of Samuel’s words. He was completely drained of energy,
1SA.28.21	 When the woman came to Saul and saw how terrified he was, she said to him, “Your servant has done what you asked.
1SA.28.22	 Now it’s your turn to listen to your servant! Let me set before you a bit of bread so that you can eat. When you regain your strength, you can go on your way.”
1SA.28.23	 But he refused, saying, “I won’t eat!” Both his servants and the woman urged
1SA.28.24	 Now the woman
1SA.28.25	 She brought it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they arose and left that same night.
1SA.29.1	 The Philistines assembled all their troops
1SA.29.2	 When the leaders of the Philistines were passing in review at the head of their units of hundreds and thousands,
1SA.29.3	 The leaders of the Philistines asked, “What about these Hebrews?” Achish said to the leaders of the Philistines, “Isn’t this David, the servant of King Saul of Israel, who has been with me for quite some time?
1SA.29.4	 But the leaders of the Philistines became angry with him and said
1SA.29.5	 Isn’t this David, of whom they sang as they danced,
1SA.29.5	‘Saul has struck down his thousands,
1SA.29.5	but David his tens of thousands’?”
1SA.29.6	 So Achish summoned David and said to him, “As surely as the 
1SA.29.7	 So turn and leave
1SA.29.8	 But David said to Achish, “What have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day that I first came into your presence until the present time, that I shouldn’t go and fight the enemies of my lord the king?” 
1SA.29.9	 Achish replied to David, “I am convinced that you are as reliable
1SA.29.10	 So get up early in the morning along with the servants of your lord who have come with you.
1SA.29.11	 So David and his men got up early in the morning to return
1SA.30.1	 On the third day David and his men came to Ziklag. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They attacked Ziklag and burned it.
1SA.30.2	 They took captive the women who were in it, from the youngest to the oldest, but they did not kill anyone. They simply carried them off and went on their way. 
1SA.30.3	 When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned.
1SA.30.4	 Then David and the men
1SA.30.5	 David’s two wives had been taken captive – Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal’s widow. 
1SA.30.6	 David was very upset, for the men
1SA.30.7	 Then David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 
1SA.30.8	 David inquired of the 
1SA.30.9	 So David went, accompanied by his six hundred men. When he came to the Wadi Besor, those who were in the rear stayed there.
1SA.30.10	 David and four hundred men continued the pursuit, but two hundred men who were too exhausted to cross the Wadi Besor stayed there. 
1SA.30.11	 Then they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. They gave him bread to eat and water to drink. 
1SA.30.12	 They gave him a slice of pressed figs and two bunches of raisins to eat. This greatly refreshed him,
1SA.30.13	 David said to him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?” The young man said, “I am an Egyptian, the servant of an Amalekite man. My master abandoned me when I was ill for three days. 
1SA.30.14	 We conducted a raid on the Negev of the Kerethites, on the area of Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb. We burned Ziklag.”
1SA.30.15	 David said to him, “Can you take us down to this raiding party?” He said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to this raiding party.”
1SA.30.16	 So he took David
1SA.30.17	 But David struck them down from twilight until the following evening. None of them escaped, with the exception of four hundred young men who got away on camels.
1SA.30.18	 David retrieved everything the Amalekites had taken; he
1SA.30.19	 There was nothing missing, whether small or great. He retrieved sons and daughters, the plunder, and everything else they had taken.
1SA.30.20	 David took all the flocks and herds and drove them in front of the rest of the animals. People were saying, “This is David’s plunder!”
1SA.30.21	 Then David approached the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to go with him,
1SA.30.22	 But all the evil and worthless men among those who had gone with David said, “Since they didn’t go with us,
1SA.30.23	 But David said, “No! You shouldn’t do this, my brothers. Look at what the 
1SA.30.24	 Who will listen to you in this matter? The portion of the one who went down into the battle will be the same as the portion of the one who remained with the equipment! Let their portions be the same!” 
1SA.30.25	 From that time onward it was a binding ordinance
1SA.30.26	 When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah who were his friends, saying, “Here’s a gift
1SA.30.27	 The gift was for those in the following locations:
1SA.30.28	 for those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	 and Racal; for those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and Kenites; 
1SA.30.30	 for those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach, 
1SA.30.31	 and Hebron; and for those in whatever other places David and his men had traveled. 
1SA.31.1	 Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel. The men of Israel fled from the Philistines and many of them fell dead on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	 The Philistines stayed right on the heels
1SA.31.3	 Saul himself was in the thick of the battle;
1SA.31.4	 Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and stab me with it! Otherwise these uncircumcised people will come, stab me, and torture me.” But his armor bearer refused to do it, because he was very afraid. So Saul took his sword and fell on it. 
1SA.31.5	 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his own sword and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	 So Saul, his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men died together that day. 
1SA.31.7	 When the men of Israel who were in the valley and across the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled. The Philistines came and occupied them. 
1SA.31.8	 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip loot from the corpses, they discovered Saul and his three sons lying dead
1SA.31.9	 They cut off Saul’s
1SA.31.10	 They placed Saul’s armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths
1SA.31.11	 When the residents of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	 all their warriors set out and traveled throughout the night. They took Saul’s corpse and the corpses of his sons from the city wall of Beth Shan and went
1SA.31.13	 They took the bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh; then they fasted for seven days.
2SA.1.1	 After the death of Saul,
2SA.1.2	 On the third day a man arrived from the camp of Saul with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.
2SA.1.3	 David asked him, “Where are you coming from?” He replied, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.” 
2SA.1.4	 David inquired, “How were things going?
2SA.1.5	 David said to the young man
2SA.1.6	 The young man who was telling him this
2SA.1.7	 When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me. I answered, ‘Here I am!’ 
2SA.1.8	 He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I told him, ‘I’m
2SA.1.9	 He said to me, ‘Stand over me and finish me off!
2SA.1.10	 So I stood over him and put him to death, since I knew that he couldn’t live in such a condition.
2SA.1.11	 David then grabbed his own clothes
2SA.1.12	 They lamented and wept and fasted until evening because Saul, his son Jonathan, the 
2SA.1.13	 David said to the young man who told this to him, “Where are you from?” He replied, “I am an Amalekite, the son of a resident foreigner.”
2SA.1.14	 David replied to him, “How is it that you were not afraid to reach out your hand to destroy the 
2SA.1.15	 Then David called one of the soldiers
2SA.1.16	 David said to him, “Your blood be on your own head! Your own mouth has testified against you, saying ‘I have put the 
2SA.1.17	 Then David chanted this lament over Saul and his son Jonathan. 
2SA.1.18	 (He gave instructions that the people of Judah should be taught “The Bow.”
2SA.1.19	 The beauty
2SA.1.19	How the mighty have fallen!
2SA.1.20	 Don’t report it in Gath,
2SA.1.20	don’t spread the news in the streets of Ashkelon,
2SA.1.20	or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,
2SA.1.20	the daughters of the uncircumcised will celebrate!
2SA.1.21	 O mountains of Gilboa, 
2SA.1.21	may there be no dew or rain on you, nor fields of grain offerings!
2SA.1.21	For it was there that the shield of warriors was defiled;
2SA.1.21	the shield of Saul lies neglected without oil.
2SA.1.22	 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of warriors,
2SA.1.22	the bow of Jonathan was not turned away.
2SA.1.22	The sword of Saul never returned
2SA.1.23	 Saul and Jonathan were greatly loved
2SA.1.23	and not even in their deaths were they separated.
2SA.1.23	They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	 O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
2SA.1.24	who clothed you in scarlet
2SA.1.24	who put gold jewelry on your clothes.
2SA.1.25	 How the warriors have fallen
2SA.1.25	in the midst of battle!
2SA.1.25	Jonathan lies slain on your high places!
2SA.1.26	 I grieve over you, my brother Jonathan!
2SA.1.26	You were very dear to me.
2SA.1.26	Your love was more special to me than the love of women.
2SA.1.27	 How the warriors have fallen!
2SA.1.27	The weapons of war
2SA.2.1	 Afterward David inquired of the 
2SA.2.2	 So David went up, along with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail, formerly the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
2SA.2.3	 David also brought along the men who were with him, each with his family. They settled in the cities
2SA.2.4	 The men of Judah came and there they anointed David as king over the people
2SA.2.4	David was told,
2SA.2.5	 So David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh Gilead and told them, “May you be blessed by the 
2SA.2.6	 Now may the 
2SA.2.7	 Now be courageous
2SA.2.8	 Now Abner son of Ner, the general in command of Saul’s army, had taken Saul’s son Ish-bosheth
2SA.2.9	 He appointed him king over Gilead, the Geshurites,
2SA.2.10	 Ish-bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he began to rule over Israel. He ruled two years. However, the people
2SA.2.11	 David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah for seven and a half years.
2SA.2.12	 Then Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	 Joab son of Zeruiah and the servants of David also went out and confronted them at the pool of Gibeon. One group stationed themselves on one side of the pool, and the other group on the other side of the pool. 
2SA.2.14	 Abner said to Joab, “Let the soldiers get up and fight
2SA.2.15	 So they got up and crossed over by number: twelve belonging to Benjamin and to Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. 
2SA.2.16	 As they grappled with one another, each one stabbed his opponent with his sword and they fell dead together.
2SA.2.17	 Now the battle was very severe that day; Abner and the men of Israel were overcome by David’s soldiers.
2SA.2.18	 The three sons of Zeruiah were there – Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. (Now Asahel was as quick on his feet as one of the gazelles in the field.) 
2SA.2.19	 Asahel chased Abner, without turning to the right or to the left as he followed Abner.
2SA.2.20	 Then Abner turned and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?” He replied, “Yes it is!” 
2SA.2.21	 Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right or to your left. Capture one of the soldiers
2SA.2.22	 So Abner spoke again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me! I do not want to strike you to the ground.
2SA.2.23	 But Asahel
2SA.2.24	 So Joab and Abishai chased Abner. At sunset they came to the hill of Ammah near Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. 
2SA.2.25	 The Benjaminites formed their ranks
2SA.2.26	 Then Abner called out to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize that this will turn bitter in the end? When will you tell the people to turn aside from pursuing their brothers?” 
2SA.2.27	 Joab replied, “As surely as God lives, if you had not said this, it would have been morning before the people would have abandoned pursuit
2SA.2.28	 Then Joab blew the ram’s horn and all the people stopped in their tracks.
2SA.2.29	 Abner and his men went through the Arabah all that night. They crossed the Jordan River
2SA.2.30	 Now Joab returned from chasing Abner and assembled all the people. Nineteen of David’s soldiers were missing, in addition to Asahel. 
2SA.2.31	 But David’s soldiers had slaughtered the Benjaminites and Abner’s men – in all, 360 men had died! 
2SA.2.32	 They took Asahel’s body and buried him in his father’s tomb at Bethlehem.
2SA.3.1	 However, the war was prolonged between the house of Saul and the house of David. David was becoming steadily stronger, while the house of Saul was becoming increasingly weaker.
2SA.3.2	 Now sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, born to Ahinoam the Jezreelite. 
2SA.3.3	 His second son
2SA.3.4	 His fourth son was Adonijah, the son of Haggith. His fifth son was Shephatiah, the son of Abitail. 
2SA.3.5	 His sixth son was Ithream, born to David’s wife Eglah. These sons
2SA.3.6	 As the war continued between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was becoming more influential
2SA.3.7	 Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth
2SA.3.8	 These words of Ish-bosheth really angered Abner and he said, “Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah? This very day I am demonstrating
2SA.3.9	 God will severely judge Abner
2SA.3.10	 namely, to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah all the way from Dan to Beer Sheba!” 
2SA.3.11	 Ish-bosheth
2SA.3.12	 Then Abner sent messengers
2SA.3.13	 So David said, “Good! I will make an agreement with you. I ask only one thing from you. You will not see my face unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal when you come to visit me.”
2SA.3.14	 David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth son of Saul with this demand:
2SA.3.15	 So Ish-bosheth took her
2SA.3.16	 Her husband went along behind her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Finally Abner said to him, “Go back!”
2SA.3.17	 Abner advised
2SA.3.18	 Act now! For the 
2SA.3.19	 Then Abner spoke privately
2SA.3.20	 When Abner, accompanied by twenty men, came to David in Hebron, David prepared a banquet for Abner and the men who were with him. 
2SA.3.21	 Abner said to David, “Let me leave so that I may go and gather all Israel to my lord the king so that they may make an agreement
2SA.3.22	 Now David’s soldiers
2SA.3.23	 When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, Joab was told: “Abner the son of Ner came to the king; he sent him away, and he left in peace!”
2SA.3.24	 So Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner
2SA.3.25	 You know Abner the son of Ner! Surely he came here to spy on you and to determine when you leave and when you return
2SA.3.26	 Then Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well of Sirah. (But David was not aware of it.) 
2SA.3.27	 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate as if to speak privately with him. Joab then stabbed him
2SA.3.28	 When David later heard about this, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the 
2SA.3.29	 May his blood whirl over
2SA.3.30	 So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel in Gibeon during the battle.
2SA.3.31	 David instructed Joab and all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes! Put on sackcloth! Lament before Abner!” Now King David followed
2SA.3.32	 So they buried Abner in Hebron. The king cried loudly
2SA.3.33	 The king chanted the following lament for Abner:
2SA.3.33	“Should Abner have died like a fool?
2SA.3.34	 Your hands
2SA.3.34	and your feet were not put into irons.
2SA.3.34	You fell the way one falls before criminals.”
2SA.3.34	All the people
2SA.3.35	 Then all the people came and encouraged David to eat food while it was still day. But David took an oath saying, “God will punish me severely
2SA.3.36	 All the people noticed this and it pleased them.
2SA.3.37	 All the people and all Israel realized on that day that the killing of Abner son of Ner was not done at the king’s instigation.
2SA.3.38	 Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not realize that a great leader
2SA.3.39	 Today I am weak, even though I am anointed as king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too much for me to bear!
2SA.4.1	 When Ish-bosheth
2SA.4.2	 Now Saul’s son
2SA.4.3	 for the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have remained there as resident foreigners until the present time.)
2SA.4.4	 Now Saul’s son Jonathan had a son who was crippled in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan arrived from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but in her haste to get away, he fell and was injured.
2SA.4.5	 Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite – Recab and Baanah – went at the hottest part of the day to the home of Ish-bosheth, as he was enjoying his midday rest. 
2SA.4.6	 They
2SA.4.7	 They had entered
2SA.4.8	 They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron, saying to the king, “Look! The head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life! The 
2SA.4.9	 David replied to Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as the 
2SA.4.10	 when someone told me that Saul was dead – even though he thought he was bringing good news
2SA.4.11	 Surely when wicked men have killed an innocent man as he slept
2SA.4.12	 So David issued orders to the soldiers and they put them to death. Then they cut off their hands and feet and hung them
2SA.5.1	 All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron saying, “Look, we are your very flesh and blood!
2SA.5.2	 In the past, when Saul was our king, you were the real leader in Israel.
2SA.5.3	 When all the leaders
2SA.5.4	 David was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned for forty years. 
2SA.5.5	 In Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem
2SA.5.6	 Then the king and his men advanced to Jerusalem
2SA.5.7	 But David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the city of David). 
2SA.5.8	 David said on that day, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites must approach the ‘lame’ and the ‘blind’ who are David’s enemies
2SA.5.9	 So David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David. David built all around it, from the terrace inwards. 
2SA.5.10	 David’s power grew steadily, for the 
2SA.5.11	 King Hiram of Tyre
2SA.5.12	 David realized that the 
2SA.5.13	 David married more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he arrived from Hebron. Even more sons and daughters were born to David. 
2SA.5.14	 These are the names of children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. 
2SA.5.17	 When the Philistines heard that David had been designated
2SA.5.18	 Now the Philistines had arrived and spread out in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.19	 So David asked the 
2SA.5.20	 So David marched against Baal Perazim and defeated them there. Then he said, “The 
2SA.5.21	 The Philistines
2SA.5.22	 The Philistines again came up and spread out in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.23	 So David asked the 
2SA.5.24	 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the trees, act decisively. For at that moment the 
2SA.5.25	 David did just as the 
2SA.6.1	 David again assembled
2SA.6.2	 David and all the men who were with him traveled
2SA.6.3	 They loaded the ark of God on a new cart and carried it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart. 
2SA.6.4	 They brought
2SA.6.5	 while David and all Israel
2SA.6.6	 When they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon,
2SA.6.7	 The 
2SA.6.8	 David was angry because the 
2SA.6.9	 David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	 So David was no longer willing to bring the ark of the 
2SA.6.11	 The ark of the 
2SA.6.12	 David was told,
2SA.6.13	 Those who carried the ark of the 
2SA.6.14	 Now David, wearing a linen ephod, was dancing with all his strength before the 
2SA.6.15	 David and all Israel
2SA.6.16	 As the ark of the 
2SA.6.17	 They brought the ark of the 
2SA.6.18	 When David finished offering the burnt sacrifices and peace offerings, he pronounced a blessing over the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	 He then handed out to each member of the entire assembly of Israel,
2SA.6.20	 When David went home to pronounce a blessing on his own house,
2SA.6.21	 David replied to Michal, “It was before the 
2SA.6.22	 I am willing to shame and humiliate myself even more than this!
2SA.6.23	 Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, had no children to the day of her death.
2SA.7.1	 The king settled into his palace,
2SA.7.2	 The king said to Nathan the prophet, “Look! I am living in a palace made from cedar, while the ark of God sits in the middle of a tent.” 
2SA.7.3	 Nathan replied to the king, “You should go
2SA.7.4	 That night the 
2SA.7.5	 “Go, tell my servant David: ‘This is what the 
2SA.7.6	 I have not lived in a house from the time I brought the Israelites up from Egypt to the present day. Instead, I was traveling with them and living in a tent.
2SA.7.7	 Wherever I moved among all the Israelites, I did not say
2SA.7.8	 “So now, say this to my servant David: ‘This is what the 
2SA.7.9	 I was with you wherever you went, and I defeated
2SA.7.10	 I will establish a place for my people Israel and settle
2SA.7.11	 and during the time when I appointed judges to lead my people Israel. Instead, I will give you relief
2SA.7.12	 When the time comes for you to die,
2SA.7.13	 He will build a house for my name, and I will make his dynasty permanent.
2SA.7.14	 I will become his father and he will become my son. When he sins, I will correct him with the rod of men and with wounds inflicted by human beings. 
2SA.7.15	 But my loyal love will not be removed from him as I removed it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 
2SA.7.16	 Your house and your kingdom will stand before me
2SA.7.17	 Nathan told David all these words that were revealed to him.
2SA.7.18	 King David went in, sat before the 
2SA.7.19	 And you didn’t stop there, O 
2SA.7.20	 What more can David say to you? You have given your servant special recognition,
2SA.7.21	 For the sake of your promise and according to your purpose
2SA.7.22	 Therefore you are great, O 
2SA.7.23	 Who is like your people, Israel, a unique nation
2SA.7.24	 You made Israel your very own people for all time.
2SA.7.25	 So now, O 
2SA.7.26	 so you may gain lasting fame,
2SA.7.27	 for you, O 
2SA.7.28	 Now, O sovereign 
2SA.7.29	 Now be willing to bless your servant’s dynasty
2SA.8.1	 Later David defeated the Philistines and subdued them. David took Metheg Ammah
2SA.8.2	 He defeated the Moabites. He made them lie on the ground and then used a rope to measure them off. He put two-thirds of them to death and spared the other third.
2SA.8.3	 David defeated King Hadadezer son of Rehob of Zobah when he came to reestablish
2SA.8.4	 David seized from him 1,700 charioteers
2SA.8.5	 The Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, but David killed 22,000 of the Arameans. 
2SA.8.6	 David placed garrisons in the territory of the Arameans of Damascus; the Arameans became David’s subjects and brought tribute. The 
2SA.8.7	 David took the golden shields that belonged to Hadadezer’s servants and brought them to Jerusalem.
2SA.8.8	 From Tebah
2SA.8.9	 When King Toi
2SA.8.10	 he
2SA.8.11	 King David dedicated these things to the 
2SA.8.12	 including
2SA.8.13	 David became famous
2SA.8.14	 He placed garrisons throughout Edom,
2SA.8.15	 David reigned over all Israel; he guaranteed justice for all his people.
2SA.8.16	 Joab son of Zeruiah was general in command of
2SA.8.17	 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar
2SA.8.18	 Benaiah son of Jehoida supervised
2SA.9.1	 Then David asked, “Is anyone still left from the family
2SA.9.2	 Now there was a servant from Saul’s house named Ziba, so he was summoned to David. The king asked him, “Are you Ziba?” He replied, “At your service.”
2SA.9.3	 The king asked, “Is there not someone left from Saul’s family,
2SA.9.4	 The king asked him, “Where is he?” Ziba told the king, “He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.
2SA.9.5	 So King David had him brought
2SA.9.6	 When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed low with his face toward the ground.
2SA.9.7	 David said to him, “Don’t be afraid, because I will certainly extend kindness to you for the sake of Jonathan your father. You will be a regular guest at my table.”
2SA.9.8	 Then Mephibosheth
2SA.9.9	 Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul’s attendant, and said to him, “Everything that belonged to Saul and to his entire house I hereby give to your master’s grandson. 
2SA.9.10	 You will cultivate
2SA.9.11	 Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do everything that my lord the king has instructed his servant to do.” So Mephibosheth was a regular guest
2SA.9.12	 Now Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. All the members of Ziba’s household were Mephibosheth’s servants. 
2SA.9.13	 Mephibosheth was living in Jerusalem,
2SA.10.1	 Later the king of the Ammonites died and his son Hanun succeeded him.
2SA.10.2	 David said, “I will express my loyalty
2SA.10.3	 the Ammonite officials said to their lord Hanun, “Do you really think David is trying to honor your father by sending these messengers to express his sympathy?
2SA.10.4	 So Hanun seized David’s servants and shaved off half of each one’s beard. He cut the lower part of their robes off so that their buttocks were exposed,
2SA.10.5	 Messengers
2SA.10.6	 When the Ammonites realized that David was disgusted with them,
2SA.10.7	 When David heard the news, he sent Joab and the entire army to meet them.
2SA.10.8	 The Ammonites marched out and were deployed for battle at the entrance of the city gate, while the men from Aram Zobah, Rehob, Ish-tob, and Maacah were by themselves in the field.
2SA.10.9	 When Joab saw that the battle would be fought on two fronts, he chose some of Israel’s best men and deployed them against the Arameans.
2SA.10.10	 He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the army
2SA.10.11	 Joab
2SA.10.12	 Be strong! Let’s fight bravely for the sake of our people and the cities of our God! The 
2SA.10.13	 So Joab and his men
2SA.10.14	 When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they fled before his brother Abishai and went into the city. Joab withdrew from fighting the Ammonites and returned to
2SA.10.15	 When the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they consolidated their forces.
2SA.10.16	 Then Hadadezer sent for Arameans from
2SA.10.17	 When David was informed, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan River,
2SA.10.18	 The Arameans fled before Israel. David killed 700 Aramean charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers.
2SA.10.19	 When all the kings who were subject to Hadadezer
2SA.11.1	 In the spring of the year, at the time when kings
2SA.11.2	 One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace.
2SA.11.3	 So David sent someone to inquire about the woman. The messenger
2SA.11.4	 David sent some messengers to get her.
2SA.11.5	 The woman conceived and then sent word to David saying, “I’m pregnant.” 
2SA.11.6	 So David sent a message to Joab that said, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent Uriah to David. 
2SA.11.7	 When Uriah came to him, David asked about how Joab and the army were doing and how the campaign was going.
2SA.11.8	 Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your home and relax.”
2SA.11.9	 But Uriah stayed at the door of the palace with all
2SA.11.10	 So they informed David, “Uriah has not gone down to his house.” So David said to Uriah, “Haven’t you just arrived from a journey? Why haven’t you gone down to your house?” 
2SA.11.11	 Uriah replied to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah reside in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and my lord’s soldiers are camping in the open field. Should I go to my house to eat and drink and have marital relations
2SA.11.12	 So David said to Uriah, “Stay here another day. Tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem both that day and the following one.
2SA.11.13	 Then David summoned him. He ate and drank with him, and got him drunk. But in the evening he went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his lord; he did not go down to his own house.
2SA.11.14	 In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. 
2SA.11.15	 In the letter he wrote: “Station Uriah in the thick of the battle and then withdraw from him so he will be cut down and killed.”
2SA.11.16	 So as Joab kept watch on the city, he stationed Uriah at the place where he knew the best enemy soldiers
2SA.11.17	 When the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, some of David’s soldiers
2SA.11.18	 Then Joab sent a full battle report to David.
2SA.11.19	 He instructed the messenger as follows: “When you finish giving the battle report to the king, 
2SA.11.20	 if the king becomes angry and asks you, ‘Why did you go so close to the city to fight? Didn’t you realize they would shoot from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	 Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerub-Besheth? Didn’t a woman throw an upper millstone
2SA.11.22	 So the messenger departed. When he arrived, he informed David of all the news that Joab had sent with him. 
2SA.11.23	 The messenger said to David, “The men overpowered us and attacked us
2SA.11.24	 Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall and some of the king’s soldiers
2SA.11.25	 David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing upset you.
2SA.11.26	 When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned for him.
2SA.11.27	 When the time of mourning passed, David had her brought to his palace.
2SA.12.1	 So the 
2SA.12.2	 The rich man had a great many flocks and herds. 
2SA.12.3	 But the poor man had nothing except for a little lamb he had acquired. He raised it, and it grew up alongside him and his children.
2SA.12.4	 “When a traveler arrived at the rich man’s home,
2SA.12.5	 Then David became very angry at this man. He said to Nathan, “As surely as the 
2SA.12.6	 Because he committed this cold-hearted crime, he must pay for the lamb four times over!”
2SA.12.7	 Nathan said to David, “You are that man! This is what the 
2SA.12.8	 I gave you your master’s house, and put your master’s wives into your arms.
2SA.12.9	 Why have you shown contempt for the word of the 
2SA.12.10	 So now the sword will never depart from your house. For you have despised me by taking the wife of Uriah the Hittite as your own!’ 
2SA.12.11	 This is what the 
2SA.12.12	 Although you have acted in secret, I will do this thing before all Israel, and in broad daylight.’”
2SA.12.13	 Then David exclaimed to Nathan, “I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.14	 Nonetheless, because you have treated the 
2SA.12.15	 Then Nathan went to his home. The 
2SA.12.16	 Then David prayed to
2SA.12.17	 The elders of his house stood over him and tried to lift him from the ground, but he was unwilling, and refused to eat food with them.
2SA.12.18	 On the seventh day the child died. But the servants of David were afraid to inform him that the child had died, for they said, “While the child was still alive he would not listen to us
2SA.12.19	 When David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he
2SA.12.20	 So David got up from the ground, bathed, put on oil, and changed his clothes. He went to the house of the 
2SA.12.21	 His servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? While
2SA.12.22	 He replied, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept because I thought,
2SA.12.23	 But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Am I able to bring him back? I will go to him, but he cannot return to me!’” 
2SA.12.24	 So David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He went to her and had marital relations with her.
2SA.12.25	 and sent word through Nathan the prophet that he should be named Jedidiah
2SA.12.26	 So Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal city. 
2SA.12.27	 Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, “I have fought against Rabbah and have captured the water supply of the city.
2SA.12.28	 So now assemble the rest of the army
2SA.12.29	 So David assembled all the army and went to Rabbah and fought against it and captured it. 
2SA.12.30	 He took the crown of their king
2SA.12.31	 He removed
2SA.13.1	 Now David’s son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. In the course of time David’s son Amnon fell madly in love with her.
2SA.13.2	 But Amnon became frustrated because he was so lovesick
2SA.13.3	 Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very crafty man. 
2SA.13.4	 He asked Amnon,
2SA.13.5	 Jonadab replied to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick.
2SA.13.6	 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came in to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come in so she can make a couple of cakes in my sight. Then I will eat from her hand.”
2SA.13.7	 So David sent Tamar to the house saying, “Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare some food for him.” 
2SA.13.8	 So Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, who was lying down. She took the dough, kneaded it, made some cakes while he watched,
2SA.13.9	 But when she took the pan and set it before him, he refused to eat. Instead Amnon said, “Get everyone out of here!”
2SA.13.10	 Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the cakes into the bedroom; then I will eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes that she had prepared and brought them to her brother Amnon in the bedroom. 
2SA.13.11	 As she brought them to him to eat, he grabbed her and said to her, “Come on! Get in bed with me,
2SA.13.12	 But she said to him, “No, my brother! Don’t humiliate me! This just isn’t done in Israel! Don’t do this foolish thing! 
2SA.13.13	 How could I ever be rid of my humiliation? And you would be considered one of the fools
2SA.13.14	 But he refused to listen to her.
2SA.13.15	 Then Amnon greatly despised her.
2SA.13.16	 But she said to him, “No I won’t, for sending me away now would be worse than what you did to me earlier!”
2SA.13.17	 He called his personal attendant and said to him, “Take this woman out of my sight
2SA.13.18	 (Now she was wearing a long robe,
2SA.13.19	 Then Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe she was wearing. She put her hands on her head and went on her way, wailing as she went.
2SA.13.20	 Her brother Absalom said to her, “Was Amnon your brother with you? Now be quiet, my sister. He is your brother. Don’t take it so seriously!”
2SA.13.21	 Now King David heard about all these things and was very angry.
2SA.13.22	 But Absalom said nothing to Amnon, either bad or good, yet Absalom hated Amnon because he had humiliated his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.23	 Two years later Absalom’s sheepshearers were in Baal Hazor,
2SA.13.24	 Then Absalom went to the king and said, “My shearers have begun their work.
2SA.13.25	 But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son. We shouldn’t all go. We shouldn’t burden you in that way.” Though Absalom
2SA.13.26	 Then Absalom said, “If you will not go,
2SA.13.27	 But when Absalom pressed him, he sent Amnon and all the king’s sons along with him. 
2SA.13.28	 Absalom instructed his servants, “Look! When Amnon is drunk
2SA.13.29	 So Absalom’s servants did to Amnon exactly what Absalom had instructed. Then all the king’s sons got up; each one rode away on his mule and fled.
2SA.13.30	 While they were still on their way, the following report reached David: “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons; not one of them is left!” 
2SA.13.31	 Then the king stood up and tore his garments and lay down on the ground. All his servants were standing there with torn garments as well.
2SA.13.32	 Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, said, “My lord should not say, ‘They have killed all the young men who are the king’s sons.’ For only Amnon is dead. This is what Absalom has talked about
2SA.13.33	 Now don’t let my lord the king be concerned about the report that has come saying, ‘All the king’s sons are dead.’ It is only Amnon who is dead.” 
2SA.13.34	 In the meantime Absalom fled. When the servant who was the watchman looked up, he saw many people coming from the west
2SA.13.35	 Jonadab said to the king, “Look! The king’s sons have come! It’s just as I said!”
2SA.13.36	 Just as he finished speaking, the king’s sons arrived, wailing and weeping.
2SA.13.37	 But Absalom fled and went to King Talmai son of Ammihud of Geshur. And David
2SA.13.38	 After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he remained there for three years. 
2SA.13.39	 The king longed
2SA.14.1	 Now Joab son of Zeruiah realized that the king longed to see
2SA.14.2	 So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman. He told her, “Pretend to be in mourning
2SA.14.3	 Go to the king and speak to him in the following fashion.” Then Joab told her what to say.
2SA.14.4	 So the Tekoan woman went
2SA.14.5	 The king replied to her, “What do you want?”
2SA.14.6	 Your servant
2SA.14.7	 Now the entire family has risen up against your servant, saying, ‘Turn over the one who struck down his brother, so that we can execute him and avenge the death
2SA.14.8	 Then the king told the woman, “Go to your home. I will give instructions concerning your situation.”
2SA.14.9	 The Tekoan woman said to the king, “My lord the king, let any blame fall on me and on the house of my father. But let the king and his throne be innocent!” 
2SA.14.10	 The king said, “Bring to me whoever speaks to you, and he won’t bother you again!” 
2SA.14.11	 She replied, “In that case,
2SA.14.12	 Then the woman said, “Please permit your servant to speak to my lord the king about another matter.” He replied, “Tell me.” 
2SA.14.13	 The woman said, “Why have you devised something like this against God’s people? When the king speaks in this fashion, he makes himself guilty, for the king has not brought back the one he has banished. 
2SA.14.14	 Certainly we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground that cannot be gathered up again. But God does not take away life; instead he devises ways for the banished to be restored.
2SA.14.15	 I have now come to speak with my lord the king about this matter, because the people have made me fearful.
2SA.14.16	 Yes!
2SA.14.17	 So your servant said, ‘May the word of my lord the king be my security, for my lord the king is like the angel of God when it comes to deciding between right and wrong! May the 
2SA.14.18	 Then the king replied to the woman, “Don’t hide any information from me when I question you.” The woman said, “Let my lord the king speak!” 
2SA.14.19	 The king said, “Did Joab put you up to all of this?”
2SA.14.20	 Your servant Joab did this so as to change this situation. But my lord has wisdom like that of the angel of God, and knows everything that is happening in the land.”
2SA.14.21	 Then the king said to Joab, “All right! I
2SA.14.22	 Then Joab bowed down with his face toward the ground and thanked
2SA.14.23	 So Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
2SA.14.24	 But the king said, “Let him go over
2SA.14.25	 Now in all Israel everyone acknowledged that there was no man as handsome as Absalom.
2SA.14.26	 When he would shave his head – at the end of every year he used to shave his head, for it grew too long
2SA.14.27	 Absalom had
2SA.14.28	 Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing the king’s face. 
2SA.14.29	 Then Absalom sent a message to Joab asking him to send him to the king, but Joab was not willing to come to him. So he sent a second message to him, but he still was not willing to come. 
2SA.14.30	 So he said to his servants, “Look, Joab has a portion of field adjacent to mine and he has some barley there. Go and set it on fire.”
2SA.14.31	 Then Joab got up and came to Absalom’s house. He said to him, “Why did your servants set my portion of field on fire?” 
2SA.14.32	 Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I sent a message to you saying, ‘Come here so that I can send you to the king with this message:
2SA.14.33	 So Joab went to the king and informed him. The king
2SA.15.1	 Some time later Absalom managed to acquire
2SA.15.2	 Now Absalom used to get up early and stand beside the road that led to the city gate. Whenever anyone came by who had a complaint to bring to the king for arbitration, Absalom would call out to him, “What city are you from?” The person would answer, “I, your servant,
2SA.15.3	 Absalom would then say to him, “Look, your claims are legitimate and appropriate.
2SA.15.4	 Absalom would then say, “If only they would make me
2SA.15.5	 When someone approached to bow before him, Absalom
2SA.15.6	 Absalom acted this way toward everyone in Israel who came to the king for justice. In this way Absalom won the loyalty
2SA.15.7	 After four
2SA.15.8	 For I made this vow
2SA.15.9	 The king replied to him, “Go in peace.” So Absalom
2SA.15.10	 Then Absalom sent spies through all the tribes of Israel who said, “When you hear the sound of the horn, you may assume
2SA.15.11	 Now two hundred men had gone with Absalom from Jerusalem. Since they were invited, they went naively and were unaware of what Absalom was planning.
2SA.15.12	 While he was offering sacrifices, Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s adviser,
2SA.15.13	 Then a messenger came to David and reported, “The men of Israel are loyal to Absalom!”
2SA.15.14	 So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem,
2SA.15.15	 The king’s servants replied to the king, “We will do whatever our lord the king decides.”
2SA.15.16	 So the king and all the members of his royal court
2SA.15.17	 The king and all the people set out on foot, pausing
2SA.15.18	 All his servants were leaving with him,
2SA.15.19	 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you come with us? Go back and stay with the new
2SA.15.20	 It seems like you arrived just yesterday. Today should I make you wander around by going with us? I go where I must go. But as for you, go back and take your men
2SA.15.21	 But Ittai replied to the king, “As surely as the 
2SA.15.22	 So David said to Ittai, “Come along then.”
2SA.15.23	 All the land was weeping loudly
2SA.15.24	 Zadok and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. When they positioned the ark of God, Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving
2SA.15.25	 Then the king said to Zadok, “Take the ark of God back to the city. If I find favor in the 
2SA.15.26	 However, if he should say, ‘I do not take pleasure in you,’ then he will deal with me in a way that he considers appropriate.”
2SA.15.27	 The king said to Zadok the priest, “Are you a seer?
2SA.15.28	 Look, I will be waiting at the fords of the desert until word from you
2SA.15.29	 So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and remained there.
2SA.15.30	 As David was going up the Mount of Olives, he was weeping as he went; his head was covered and his feet were bare. All the people who were with him also had their heads covered and were weeping as they went up. 
2SA.15.31	 Now David
2SA.15.32	 When David reached the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite met him with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. 
2SA.15.33	 David said to him, “If you leave
2SA.15.34	 But you will be able to counter the advice of Ahithophel if you go back to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king! Previously I was your father’s servant, and now I will be your servant.’ 
2SA.15.35	 Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you.
2SA.15.36	 Furthermore, their two sons are there with them, Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan. You must send them to me with any information you hear.”
2SA.15.37	 So David’s friend Hushai arrived in the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem. 
2SA.16.1	 When David had gone a short way beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He had a couple of donkeys that were saddled, and on them were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred raisin cakes, a hundred baskets of summer fruit,
2SA.16.2	 The king asked Ziba, “Why did you bring these things?”
2SA.16.3	 The king asked, “Where is your master’s grandson?”
2SA.16.4	 The king said to Ziba, “Everything that was Mephibosheth’s now belongs to you.” Ziba replied, “I bow before you. May I find favor in your sight, my lord the king.” 
2SA.16.5	 Then King David reached
2SA.16.6	 He threw stones at David and all of King David’s servants, as well as all the people and the soldiers who were on his right and on his left. 
2SA.16.7	 As he yelled curses, Shimei said, “Leave! Leave! You man of bloodshed, you wicked man!
2SA.16.8	 The 
2SA.16.9	 Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!” 
2SA.16.10	 But the king said, “What do we have in common,
2SA.16.11	 Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “My own son, my very own flesh and blood,
2SA.16.12	 Perhaps the 
2SA.16.13	 So David and his men went on their way. But Shimei kept going along the side of the hill opposite him, yelling curses as he threw stones and dirt at them.
2SA.16.14	 The king and all the people who were with him arrived exhausted at their destination, where David
2SA.16.15	 Now when Absalom and all the men
2SA.16.16	 When David’s friend Hushai the Arkite came to Absalom, Hushai said to him,
2SA.16.17	 Absalom said to Hushai, “Do you call this loyalty to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?” 
2SA.16.18	 Hushai replied to Absalom, “No, I will be loyal to the one whom the 
2SA.16.19	 Moreover, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.”
2SA.16.20	 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give us your advice. What should we do?” 
2SA.16.21	 Ahithophel replied to Absalom, “Have sex with
2SA.16.22	 So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof,
2SA.16.23	 In those days Ahithophel’s advice was considered as valuable as a prophetic revelation.
2SA.17.1	 Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me pick out twelve thousand men. Then I will go and pursue David this very night. 
2SA.17.2	 When I catch up with
2SA.17.3	 and will bring the entire army back to you. In exchange for the life of the man you are seeking, you will get back everyone.
2SA.17.4	 This seemed like a good idea to Absalom and to all the leaders
2SA.17.5	 But Absalom said, “Call for
2SA.17.6	 So Hushai came to Absalom. Absalom said to him, “Here is what Ahithophel has advised. Should we follow his advice? If not, what would you recommend?”
2SA.17.7	 Hushai replied to Absalom, “Ahithophel’s advice is not sound this time.”
2SA.17.8	 Hushai went on to say, “You know your father and his men – they are soldiers and are as dangerous as a bear out in the wild that has been robbed of her cubs.
2SA.17.9	 At this very moment he is hiding out in one of the caves or in some other similar place. If it should turn out that he attacks our troops first,
2SA.17.10	 If that happens even the bravest soldier – one who is lion-hearted – will virtually melt away. For all Israel knows that your father is a warrior and that those who are with him are brave. 
2SA.17.11	 My advice therefore is this: Let all Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba – in number like the sand by the sea! – be mustered to you, and you lead them personally into battle. 
2SA.17.12	 We will come against him wherever he happens to be found. We will descend on him like the dew falls on the ground. Neither he nor any of the men who are with him will be spared alive – not one of them! 
2SA.17.13	 If he regroups in a city, all Israel will take up ropes to that city and drag it down to the valley, so that not a single pebble will be left there!”
2SA.17.14	 Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite sounds better than the advice of Ahithophel.” Now the 
2SA.17.15	 Then Hushai reported to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “Here is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the leaders
2SA.17.16	 Now send word quickly to David and warn him,
2SA.17.17	 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying in En Rogel. A female servant would go and inform them, and they would then go and inform King David. It was not advisable for them to be seen going into the city. 
2SA.17.18	 But a young man saw them on one occasion and informed Absalom. So the two of them quickly departed and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. There was a well in his courtyard, and they got down in it. 
2SA.17.19	 His wife then took the covering and spread it over the top of the well and scattered some grain over it. No one was aware of what she had done. 
2SA.17.20	 When the servants of Absalom approached the woman at her home, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” The woman replied to them, “They crossed over the stream.” Absalom’s men
2SA.17.21	 After the men had left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan
2SA.17.22	 So David and all the people who were with him got up and crossed the Jordan River.
2SA.17.23	 When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and returned to his house in his hometown. After setting his household in order, he hanged himself. So he died and was buried in the grave
2SA.17.24	 Meanwhile David had gone to Mahanaim, while Absalom and all the men of Israel had crossed the Jordan River. 
2SA.17.25	 Absalom had made Amasa general in command of the army in place of Joab. (Now Amasa was the son of an Israelite man named Jether, who had married
2SA.17.26	 The army of Israel
2SA.17.27	 When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim 
2SA.17.28	 brought bedding, basins, and pottery utensils. They also brought food for David and all who were with him, including wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,
2SA.17.29	 honey, curds, flocks, and cheese.
2SA.18.1	 David assembled the army that was with him. He appointed leaders of thousands and leaders of hundreds. 
2SA.18.2	 David then sent out the army – a third under the leadership of Joab, a third under the leadership of Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under the leadership of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the troops, “I too will indeed march out with you.”
2SA.18.3	 But the soldiers replied,
2SA.18.4	 Then the king said to them, “I will do whatever seems best to you.”
2SA.18.4	So the king stayed beside the city gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands. 
2SA.18.5	 The king gave this order to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: “For my sake deal gently with the young man Absalom.” Now the entire army was listening when the king gave all the leaders this order concerning Absalom.
2SA.18.6	 Then the army marched out to the field to fight against Israel. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	 The army of Israel was defeated there by David’s men.
2SA.18.8	 The battle there was spread out over the whole area, and the forest consumed more soldiers than the sword devoured that day.
2SA.18.9	 Then Absalom happened to come across David’s men. Now as Absalom was riding on his
2SA.18.10	 When one
2SA.18.11	 Joab replied to the man who was telling him this, “What! You saw this? Why didn’t you strike him down right on the spot?
2SA.18.12	 The man replied to Joab, “Even if
2SA.18.13	 If I had acted at risk of my own life
2SA.18.14	 Joab replied, “I will not wait around like this for you!” He took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the middle of Absalom while he was still alive in the middle of the oak tree.
2SA.18.15	 Then ten soldiers who were Joab’s armor bearers struck Absalom and finished him off.
2SA.18.16	 Then Joab blew the trumpet
2SA.18.17	 They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and stacked a huge pile of stones over him. In the meantime all the Israelite soldiers fled to their homes.
2SA.18.18	 Prior to this
2SA.18.19	 Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me run and give the king the good news that the 
2SA.18.20	 But Joab said to him, “You will not be a bearer of good news today. You will bear good news some other day, but not today,
2SA.18.21	 Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go and tell the king what you have seen.” After bowing to Joab, the Cushite ran off. 
2SA.18.22	 Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again spoke to Joab, “Whatever happens, let me go after the Cushite.” But Joab said, “Why is it that you want to go, my son? You have no good news that will bring you a reward.” 
2SA.18.23	 But he said,
2SA.18.24	 Now David was sitting between the inner and outer gates,
2SA.18.25	 So the watchman called out and informed the king. The king said, “If he is by himself, he brings good news.”
2SA.18.26	 Then the watchman saw another man running. The watchman called out to the gatekeeper, “There is another man running by himself.” The king said, “This one also is bringing good news.” 
2SA.18.27	 The watchman said, “It appears to me that the first runner is Ahimaaz
2SA.18.28	 Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “Greetings!”
2SA.18.29	 The king replied, “How is the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz replied, “I saw a great deal of confusion when Joab was sending the king’s servant and me, your servant, but I don’t know what it was all about.” 
2SA.18.30	 The king said, “Turn aside and take your place here.” So he turned aside and waited. 
2SA.18.31	 Then the Cushite arrived and said,
2SA.18.32	 The king asked the Cushite, “How is the young man Absalom?” The Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who have plotted against you
2SA.19.2	 So the victory of that day was turned to mourning as far as all the people were concerned. For the people heard on that day, “The king is grieved over his son.” 
2SA.19.3	 That day the people stole away to go to the city the way people who are embarrassed steal away in fleeing from battle. 
2SA.19.4	 The king covered his face and cried out loudly,
2SA.19.5	 So Joab visited
2SA.19.6	 You seem to love your enemies and hate your friends! For you have as much as declared today that leaders and servants don’t matter to you. I realize now
2SA.19.7	 So get up now and go out and give some encouragement to
2SA.19.8	 So the king got up and sat at the city gate. When all the people were informed that the king was sitting at the city gate, they
2SA.19.8	But the Israelite soldiers
2SA.19.9	 All the people throughout all the tribes of Israel were arguing among themselves saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies. He rescued us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled from the land because of Absalom. 
2SA.19.10	 But Absalom, whom we anointed as our king,
2SA.19.11	 Then King David sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests saying, “Tell the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you delay any further in bringing the king back to his palace,
2SA.19.12	 You are my brothers – my very own flesh and blood!
2SA.19.13	 Say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my flesh and blood?
2SA.19.14	 He
2SA.19.15	 So the king returned and came to the Jordan River.
2SA.19.15	Now the people of Judah
2SA.19.16	 Shimei son of Gera the Benjaminite from Bahurim came down quickly with the men of Judah to meet King David. 
2SA.19.17	 There were a thousand men from Benjamin with him, along with Ziba the servant
2SA.19.18	 They crossed at the ford in order to help the king’s household cross and to do whatever he thought appropriate.
2SA.19.18	Now after he had crossed the Jordan, Shimei son of Gera threw himself down before the king. 
2SA.19.19	 He said to the king, “Don’t think badly of me, my lord, and don’t recall the sin of your servant on the day when you, my lord the king, left
2SA.19.20	 For I, your servant,
2SA.19.21	 Abishai son of Zeruiah replied, “For this should not Shimei be put to death? After all, he cursed the 
2SA.19.22	 But David said, “What do we have in common,
2SA.19.23	 The king said to Shimei, “You won’t die.” The king vowed an oath
2SA.19.24	 Now Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson,
2SA.19.25	 When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?” 
2SA.19.26	 He replied, “My lord the king, my servant deceived me! I
2SA.19.27	 But my servant
2SA.19.28	 After all, there was no one in the entire house of my grandfather
2SA.19.29	 Then the king replied to him, “Why should you continue speaking like this? You and Ziba will inherit the field together.” 
2SA.19.30	 Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him have
2SA.19.31	 Now when Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim, he crossed the Jordan with the king so he could send him on his way from there.
2SA.19.32	 But Barzillai was very old – eighty years old, in fact – and he had taken care of the king when he stayed in Mahanaim, for he was a very rich
2SA.19.33	 So the king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me, and I will take care of you while you are with me in Jerusalem.”
2SA.19.34	 Barzillai replied to the king, “How many days do I have left to my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	 I am presently eighty years old. Am I able to discern good and bad? Can I
2SA.19.36	 I will cross the Jordan with the king and go a short distance.
2SA.19.37	 Let me
2SA.19.38	 The king replied, “Kimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever I deem appropriate. And whatever you choose, I will do for you.”
2SA.19.39	 So all the people crossed the Jordan, as did the king. After the king had kissed him and blessed him, Barzillai returned to his home.
2SA.19.40	 When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham
2SA.19.41	 Then all the men of Israel began coming to the king. They asked the king, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, sneak the king away and help the king and his household cross the Jordan – and not only him but all of David’s men as well?” 
2SA.19.42	 All the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, “Because the king is our close relative! Why are you so upset about this? Have we eaten at the king’s expense?
2SA.19.43	 The men of Israel replied to the men of Judah, “We have ten shares in the king, and we have a greater claim on David than you do! Why do you want
2SA.20.1	 Now a wicked man
2SA.20.1	“We have no share in David; 
2SA.20.1	we have no inheritance in this son of Jesse!
2SA.20.1	Every man go home,
2SA.20.2	 So all the men of Israel deserted
2SA.20.3	 Then David went to his palace
2SA.20.4	 Then the king said to Amasa, “Call the men of Judah together for me in three days,
2SA.20.5	 So Amasa went out to call Judah together. But in doing so he took longer than the time that the king had allotted him.
2SA.20.6	 Then David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba son of Bicri will cause greater disaster for us than Absalom did! Take your lord’s servants and pursue him. Otherwise he will secure
2SA.20.7	 So Joab’s men, accompanied by the Kerethites, the Pelethites, and all the warriors, left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.
2SA.20.8	 When they were near the big rock that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to them. Now Joab was dressed in military attire and had a dagger in its sheath belted to his waist. When he advanced, it fell out.
2SA.20.9	 Joab said to Amasa, “How are you, my brother?” With his right hand Joab took hold of Amasa’s beard as if to greet him with a kiss. 
2SA.20.10	 Amasa did not protect himself from the knife in Joab’s other hand, and Joab
2SA.20.11	 One of Joab’s soldiers who stood over Amasa said, “Whoever is for
2SA.20.12	 Amasa was squirming in his own blood in the middle of the path, and this man had noticed that all the soldiers stopped. Having noticed that everyone who came across Amasa
2SA.20.13	 Once he had removed Amasa
2SA.20.14	 Sheba
2SA.20.15	 So Joab’s men
2SA.20.16	 a wise woman called out from the city, “Listen up! Listen up! Tell Joab, ‘Come near so that I may speak to you.’”
2SA.20.17	 When he approached her, the woman asked, “Are you Joab?” He replied, “I am.” She said to him, “Listen to the words of your servant.” He said, “Go ahead. I’m listening.” 
2SA.20.18	 She said, “In the past they would always say, ‘Let them inquire in Abel,’ and that is how they settled things. 
2SA.20.19	 I represent the peaceful and the faithful in Israel. You are attempting to destroy an important city
2SA.20.20	 Joab answered, “Get serious!
2SA.20.21	 That’s not the way things are. There is a man from the hill country of Ephraim named Sheba son of Bicri. He has rebelled
2SA.20.22	 Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice and they cut off Sheba’s head and threw it out to Joab. Joab
2SA.20.23	 Now Joab was the general in command of all the army of Israel. Benaiah the son of Jehoida was over the Kerethites and the Perethites. 
2SA.20.24	 Adoniram
2SA.20.25	 Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests. 
2SA.20.26	 Ira the Jairite was David’s personal priest.
2SA.21.1	 During David’s reign there was a famine for three consecutive years. So David inquired of the 
2SA.21.2	 So the king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke with them. (Now the Gibeonites were not descendants of Israel; they were a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had made a promise to
2SA.21.3	 David said to the Gibeonites, “What can I do for you, and how can I make amends so that you will bless
2SA.21.4	 The Gibeonites said to him, “We
2SA.21.5	 They replied to the king, “As for this man who exterminated us and who schemed against us so that we were destroyed and left without status throughout all the borders of Israel – 
2SA.21.6	 let seven of his male descendants be turned over to us, and we will execute
2SA.21.7	 The king had mercy on Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, in light of the 
2SA.21.8	 So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah’s daughter Rizpah whom she had born to Saul, and the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab
2SA.21.9	 He turned them over to the Gibeonites, and they executed them on a hill before the 
2SA.21.10	 Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest until the rain fell on them,
2SA.21.11	 When David was told what Rizpah daughter of Aiah, Saul’s concubine, had done, 
2SA.21.12	 he
2SA.21.13	 David
2SA.21.14	 They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin at Zela in the grave of his father Kish. After they had done everything
2SA.21.15	 Another battle was fought between the Philistines and Israel. So David went down with his soldiers
2SA.21.16	 Now Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha,
2SA.21.17	 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to David’s aid, striking the Philistine down and killing him. Then David’s men took an oath saying, “You will not go out to battle with us again! You must not extinguish the lamp of Israel!”
2SA.21.18	 Later there was another battle with the Philistines, this time in Gob. On that occasion Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the descendants of Rapha. 
2SA.21.19	 Yet another battle occurred with the Philistines in Gob. On that occasion Elhanan the son of Jair
2SA.21.20	 Yet another battle occurred in Gath. On that occasion there was a large man
2SA.21.21	 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, killed him. 
2SA.21.22	 These four were the descendants of Rapha who lived in Gath; they were killed
2SA.22.1	 David sang
2SA.22.2	 He said:
2SA.22.2	“The 
2SA.22.3	 My God
2SA.22.3	my shield, the horn that saves me,
2SA.22.3	my refuge, my savior. You save me from violence!
2SA.22.4	 I called
2SA.22.4	and I was delivered from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	 The waves of death engulfed me;
2SA.22.5	the currents
2SA.22.6	 The ropes of Sheol
2SA.22.6	the snares of death trapped me.
2SA.22.7	 In my distress I called to the 
2SA.22.7	I called to my God.
2SA.22.7	From his heavenly temple
2SA.22.7	he listened to my cry for help.
2SA.22.8	 The earth heaved and shook;
2SA.22.8	the foundations of the sky
2SA.22.8	They heaved because he was angry.
2SA.22.9	 Smoke ascended from
2SA.22.9	fire devoured as it came from his mouth;
2SA.22.9	he hurled down fiery coals.
2SA.22.10	 He made the sky sink
2SA.22.10	a thick cloud was under his feet.
2SA.22.11	 He mounted
2SA.22.11	he glided
2SA.22.12	 He shrouded himself in darkness,
2SA.22.12	in thick rain clouds.
2SA.22.13	 From the brightness in front of him 
2SA.22.13	came coals of fire.
2SA.22.14	 The 
2SA.22.14	the sovereign One
2SA.22.15	 He shot

2SA.22.16	 The depths
2SA.22.16	the inner regions
2SA.22.16	by the 
2SA.22.16	by the powerful breath from his nose.
2SA.22.17	 He reached down from above and grabbed me;
2SA.22.17	he pulled me from the surging water.
2SA.22.18	 He rescued me from my strong enemy,
2SA.22.18	from those who hate me, 
2SA.22.18	for they were too strong for me.
2SA.22.19	 They confronted
2SA.22.19	but the 
2SA.22.20	 He brought me out into a wide open place;
2SA.22.20	he delivered me because he was pleased with me.
2SA.22.21	 The 
2SA.22.21	he rewarded
2SA.22.22	 For I have obeyed the 
2SA.22.22	I have not rebelled against my God.
2SA.22.23	 For I am aware of all his regulations,
2SA.22.23	and I do not reject his rules.
2SA.22.24	 I was blameless before him;
2SA.22.24	I kept myself from sinning.
2SA.22.25	 The 
2SA.22.25	he took notice of my blameless behavior.
2SA.22.26	 You prove to be loyal
2SA.22.26	you prove to be trustworthy
2SA.22.27	 You prove to be reliable
2SA.22.27	but you prove to be deceptive

2SA.22.28	but you watch the proud and bring them down.
2SA.22.29	 Indeed,
2SA.22.29	The 
2SA.22.30	 Indeed,
2SA.22.30	by my God’s power
2SA.22.31	 The one true God acts in a faithful manner;
2SA.22.31	the 
2SA.22.31	he is a shield to all who take shelter in him.
2SA.22.32	 Indeed,
2SA.22.32	Who is a protector
2SA.22.33	 The one true God
2SA.22.33	he removes
2SA.22.34	 He gives me the agility of a deer;
2SA.22.34	he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain.
2SA.22.35	 He trains
2SA.22.35	my arms can bend even the strongest bow.
2SA.22.36	 You give me
2SA.22.36	your willingness to help enables me to prevail.
2SA.22.37	 You widen my path;
2SA.22.37	my feet
2SA.22.38	 I chase my enemies and destroy them;
2SA.22.38	I do not turn back until I wipe them out.
2SA.22.39	 I wipe them out and beat them to death;
2SA.22.39	they cannot get up;
2SA.22.39	they fall at my feet.
2SA.22.40	 You give me strength for battle;
2SA.22.40	you make my foes kneel before me.
2SA.22.41	 You make my enemies retreat;
2SA.22.41	I destroy those who hate me.
2SA.22.42	 They cry out,
2SA.22.42	they cry out to the 
2SA.22.43	 I grind them as fine as the dust of the ground;
2SA.22.43	I crush them and stomp on them like clay
2SA.22.44	 You rescue me from a hostile army;
2SA.22.44	you preserve me as a leader of nations;
2SA.22.44	people over whom I had no authority are now my subjects.
2SA.22.45	 Foreigners are powerless before me;
2SA.22.45	when they hear of my exploits, they submit to me.
2SA.22.46	 Foreigners lose their courage;
2SA.22.46	they shake with fear
2SA.22.47	 The 
2SA.22.47	My protector
2SA.22.47	The God who delivers me
2SA.22.48	 The one true God completely vindicates me;
2SA.22.48	he makes nations submit to me.
2SA.22.49	 He delivers me from my enemies;
2SA.22.49	you snatch me away
2SA.22.49	you rescue me from violent men.
2SA.22.50	 So I will give you thanks, O 
2SA.22.50	I will sing praises to you.
2SA.22.51	 He gives his chosen king magnificent victories;
2SA.22.51	he is faithful to his chosen ruler,
2SA.22.51	to David and to his descendants forever!”
2SA.23.1	 These are the final words of David:
2SA.23.1	“The oracle of David son of Jesse,
2SA.23.1	the oracle of the man raised up as
2SA.23.1	the ruler chosen by the God of Jacob,
2SA.23.1	Israel’s beloved
2SA.23.2	 The 
2SA.23.2	his word was on my tongue.
2SA.23.3	 The God of Israel spoke,
2SA.23.3	the protector
2SA.23.3	The one who rules fairly among men,
2SA.23.3	the one who rules in the fear of God,
2SA.23.4	 is like the light of morning when the sun comes up,
2SA.23.4	a morning in which there are no clouds.
2SA.23.4	He is like the brightness after rain
2SA.23.4	that produces grass from the earth.
2SA.23.5	 My dynasty is approved by God,
2SA.23.5	for he has made a perpetual covenant with me,
2SA.23.5	arranged in all its particulars and secured.
2SA.23.5	He always delivers me,
2SA.23.5	and brings all I desire to fruition.
2SA.23.6	 But evil people are like thorns – 
2SA.23.6	all of them are tossed away,
2SA.23.6	for they cannot be held in the hand.
2SA.23.7	 The one who touches them
2SA.23.7	must use an iron instrument
2SA.23.7	or the wooden shaft of a spear.
2SA.23.7	They are completely burned up right where they lie!”
2SA.23.8	 These are the names of David’s warriors:
2SA.23.8	Josheb-Basshebeth, a Tahkemonite, was head of the officers.
2SA.23.9	 Next in command
2SA.23.10	 he stood his ground
2SA.23.11	 Next in command
2SA.23.12	 But he made a stand in the middle of that area. He defended
2SA.23.13	 At the time of
2SA.23.14	 David was in the stronghold at the time, while a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem.
2SA.23.15	 David was thirsty and said, “How I wish someone would give me some water to drink from the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate!” 
2SA.23.16	 So the three elite warriors broke through the Philistine forces and drew some water from the cistern in Bethlehem near the gate. They carried it back to David, but he refused to drink it. He poured it out as a drink offering to the

1KI.1.9	 Adonijah sacrificed sheep, cattle, and fattened steers at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king’s sons,
1KI.1.10	 But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the elite warriors,
1KI.1.11	 Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Has it been reported to you
1KI.1.12	 Now
1KI.1.13	 Visit
1KI.1.14	 While
1KI.1.15	 So Bathsheba visited the king in his private quarters.
1KI.1.16	 Bathsheba bowed down on the floor before
1KI.1.17	 She replied to him, “My master, you swore an oath to your servant by the 
1KI.1.18	 But now, look, Adonijah has become king! But you,
1KI.1.19	 He has sacrificed many cattle, steers, and sheep and has invited all the king’s sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab, the commander of the army, but he has not invited your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.20	 Now,
1KI.1.21	 If a decision is not made,
1KI.1.22	 Just then,
1KI.1.23	 The king was told, “Nathan the prophet is here.” Nathan entered and bowed before the king with his face to the floor.
1KI.1.24	 Nathan said, “My master, O king, did you announce, ‘Adonijah will be king after me; he will sit on my throne’? 
1KI.1.25	 For today he has gone down and sacrificed many cattle, steers, and sheep and has invited all the king’s sons, the army commanders, and Abiathar the priest. At this moment
1KI.1.26	 But he did not invite me – your servant – or Zadok the priest, or Benaiah son of Jehoiada, or your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.27	 Has my master the king authorized this without informing your servants
1KI.1.28	 King David responded,
1KI.1.29	 The king swore an oath: “As certainly as the 
1KI.1.30	 I will keep
1KI.1.31	 Bathsheba bowed down to the king with her face to the floor
1KI.1.32	 King David said, “Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet,
1KI.1.33	 and he
1KI.1.34	 There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet will anoint
1KI.1.35	 Then follow him up as he comes and sits on my throne. He will be king in my place; I have decreed
1KI.1.36	 Benaiah son of Jehoiada responded
1KI.1.37	 As the 
1KI.1.38	 So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites
1KI.1.39	 Zadok the priest took a horn filled with olive oil
1KI.1.40	 All the people followed him up, playing flutes and celebrating so loudly they made the ground shake.
1KI.1.41	 Now Adonijah and all his guests heard the commotion just as they had finished eating.
1KI.1.42	 As he was still speaking, Jonathan
1KI.1.43	 Jonathan replied
1KI.1.44	 The king sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites and they put him on the king’s mule. 
1KI.1.45	 Then Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed
1KI.1.46	 Furthermore, Solomon has assumed the royal throne.
1KI.1.47	 The king’s servants have even come to congratulate
1KI.1.48	 and said
1KI.1.49	 All of Adonijah’s guests panicked;
1KI.1.50	 Adonijah feared Solomon, so he got up and went and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar.
1KI.1.51	 Solomon was told, “Look, Adonijah fears you;
1KI.1.52	 Solomon said, “If he is a loyal subject,
1KI.1.53	 King Solomon sent men to bring him down
1KI.2.1	 When David was close to death,
1KI.2.2	 “I am about to die.
1KI.2.3	 Do the job the 
1KI.2.4	 and the 
1KI.2.5	 “You know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me – how he murdered two commanders of the Israelite armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether.
1KI.2.6	 Do to him what you think is appropriate,
1KI.2.7	 “Treat fairly
1KI.2.8	 “Note well, you still have to contend with Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim,
1KI.2.9	 But now
1KI.2.10	 Then David passed away
1KI.2.11	 David reigned over Israel forty years; he reigned in Hebron seven years, and in Jerusalem
1KI.2.12	 Solomon sat on his father David’s throne, and his royal authority
1KI.2.13	 Haggith’s son Adonijah visited Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. She asked, “Do you come in peace?” He answered, “Yes.”
1KI.2.14	 He added,
1KI.2.15	 He said, “You know that the kingdom
1KI.2.16	 Now I’d like to ask you for just one thing. Please don’t refuse me.”
1KI.2.17	 He said, “Please ask King Solomon if he would give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife, for he won’t refuse you.”
1KI.2.18	 Bathsheba replied, “That’s fine,
1KI.2.19	 So Bathsheba visited King Solomon to speak to him on Adonijah’s behalf. The king got up to greet
1KI.2.20	 She said, “I would like to ask you for just one small favor.
1KI.2.21	 She said, “Allow Abishag the Shunammite to be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife.” 
1KI.2.22	 King Solomon answered his mother, “Why just request Abishag the Shunammite for him?
1KI.2.23	 King Solomon then swore an oath by the 
1KI.2.24	 Now, as certainly as the 
1KI.2.25	 King Solomon then sent
1KI.2.26	 The king then told Abiathar the priest, “Go back to your property
1KI.2.27	 Solomon dismissed Abiathar from his position as priest of the 
1KI.2.28	 When the news reached Joab (for Joab had supported
1KI.2.29	 When King Solomon heard
1KI.2.30	 When Benaiah arrived at the tent of the 
1KI.2.31	 The king told him, “Do as he said! Strike him down and bury him. Take away from me and from my father’s family
1KI.2.32	 May the 
1KI.2.33	 May Joab and his descendants be perpetually guilty of their shed blood, but may the 
1KI.2.34	 So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and executed Joab;
1KI.2.35	 The king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada to take his place at the head of
1KI.2.36	 Next the king summoned
1KI.2.37	 If you ever do leave and cross the Kidron Valley, know for sure that you will certainly die! You will be responsible for your own death.”
1KI.2.38	 Shimei said to the king, “My master the king’s proposal is acceptable.
1KI.2.39	 Three years later two of Shimei’s servants ran away to King Achish son of Maacah of Gath. Shimei was told, “Look, your servants are in Gath.” 
1KI.2.40	 So Shimei got up, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish at Gath to find his servants; Shimei went and brought back his servants from Gath. 
1KI.2.41	 When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had then returned, 
1KI.2.42	 the king summoned
1KI.2.43	 Why then have you broken the oath you made before the 
1KI.2.44	 Then the king said to Shimei, “You are well aware of the way you mistreated my father David.
1KI.2.45	 But King Solomon will be empowered
1KI.2.46	 The king then gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada who went and executed Shimei.
1KI.2.46	So Solomon took firm control of the kingdom.
1KI.3.1	 Solomon made an alliance by marriage with Pharaoh, king of Egypt; he married Pharaoh’s daughter. He brought her to the City of David
1KI.3.2	 Now the people were offering sacrifices at the high places,
1KI.3.3	 Solomon demonstrated his loyalty to the 
1KI.3.4	 The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for it had the most prominent of the high places.
1KI.3.5	 One night in Gibeon the 
1KI.3.6	 Solomon replied, “You demonstrated
1KI.3.7	 Now, O 
1KI.3.8	 Your servant stands
1KI.3.9	 So give your servant a discerning mind
1KI.3.10	 The Lord
1KI.3.11	 God said to him, “Because you asked for the ability to make wise judicial decisions, and not for long life, or riches, or vengeance on your enemies,
1KI.3.12	 I
1KI.3.13	 Furthermore, I am giving
1KI.3.14	 If you follow my instructions
1KI.3.15	 Solomon then woke up and realized it was a dream.
1KI.3.16	 Then two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. 
1KI.3.17	 One of the women said, “My master, this woman and I live in the same house. I had a baby while she was with me in the house. 
1KI.3.18	 Then three days after I had my baby, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one else in the house except the two of us.
1KI.3.19	 This woman’s child suffocated
1KI.3.20	 She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your servant was sleeping. She put him in her arms, and put her dead son in my arms. 
1KI.3.21	 I got up in the morning to nurse my son, and there he was,
1KI.3.22	 The other woman said, “No! My son is alive; your son is dead!” But the first woman replied, “No, your son is dead; my son is alive.” Each presented her case before the king.
1KI.3.23	 The king said, “One says, ‘My son is alive; your son is dead,’ while the other says, ‘No, your son is dead; my son is alive.’” 
1KI.3.24	 The king ordered, “Get me a sword!” So they placed a sword before the king. 
1KI.3.25	 The king then said, “Cut the living child in two, and give half to one and half to the other!” 
1KI.3.26	 The real mother
1KI.3.27	 The king responded, “Give the first woman the living child; don’t kill him. She is the mother.” 
1KI.3.28	 When all Israel heard about the judicial decision which the king had rendered, they respected
1KI.4.1	 King Solomon ruled over all Israel. 
1KI.4.2	 These were his officials:
1KI.4.2	Azariah son of Zadok was the priest.
1KI.4.3	 Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, wrote down what happened.
1KI.4.3	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of the records.
1KI.4.4	 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was commander of
1KI.4.4	Zadok and Abiathar were priests.
1KI.4.5	 Azariah son of Nathan was supervisor of
1KI.4.5	Zabud son of Nathan was a priest and adviser to
1KI.4.6	 Ahishar was supervisor of the palace.
1KI.4.6	Adoniram son of Abda was supervisor of
1KI.4.7	 Solomon had twelve district governors appointed throughout Israel who acquired supplies for the king and his palace. Each was responsible for one month in the year. 
1KI.4.8	 These were their names:
1KI.4.8	Ben-Hur was in charge of the hill country of Ephraim.
1KI.4.9	 Ben-Deker was in charge of Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan.
1KI.4.10	 Ben-Hesed was in charge of Arubboth; he controlled Socoh and all the territory of Hepher.
1KI.4.11	 Ben-Abinadab was in charge of Naphath Dor. (He was married to Solomon’s daughter Taphath.)
1KI.4.12	 Baana son of Ahilud was in charge of Taanach and Megiddo,
1KI.4.13	 Ben-Geber was in charge of Ramoth Gilead; he controlled the tent villages of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead, as well as the region of Argob in Bashan, including sixty large walled cities with bronze bars locking their gates.
1KI.4.14	 Ahinadab son of Iddo was in charge of Mahanaim.
1KI.4.15	 Ahimaaz was in charge of Naphtali. (He married Solomon’s daughter Basemath.)
1KI.4.16	 Baana son of Hushai was in charge of Asher and Aloth.
1KI.4.17	 Jehoshaphat son of Paruah was in charge of Issachar.
1KI.4.18	 Shimei son of Ela was in charge of Benjamin.
1KI.4.19	 Geber son of Uri was in charge of the land of Gilead (the territory which had once belonged to King Sihon of the Amorites and to King Og of Bashan). He was sole governor of the area.
1KI.4.20	 The people of Judah and Israel were as innumerable as the sand on the seashore; they had plenty to eat and drink and were happy. 
1KI.4.22	 Each day Solomon’s royal court consumed
1KI.4.23	 ten calves fattened in the stall,
1KI.4.24	 His royal court was so large because
1KI.4.25	 All the people of Judah and Israel had security; everyone from Dan to Beer Sheba enjoyed the produce of their vines and fig trees throughout Solomon’s lifetime.
1KI.4.26	 Solomon had 4,000
1KI.4.27	 The district governors acquired supplies for King Solomon and all who ate in his royal palace.
1KI.4.28	 Each one also brought to the assigned location his quota of barley and straw for the various horses.
1KI.4.29	 God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment; the breadth of his understanding
1KI.4.30	 Solomon was wiser than all the men of the east and all the sages of Egypt.
1KI.4.31	 He was wiser than any man, including Ethan the Ezrahite or Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. He was famous in all the neighboring nations.
1KI.4.32	 He composed
1KI.4.33	 He produced manuals on botany, describing every kind of plant,
1KI.4.34	 People from all nations came to hear Solomon’s display of wisdom;
1KI.5.2	 Solomon then sent this message to Hiram: 
1KI.5.3	 “You know that my father David was unable to build a temple to honor the 
1KI.5.4	 But now the 
1KI.5.5	 So I have decided
1KI.5.6	 So now order some cedars of Lebanon to be cut for me. My servants will work with your servants. I will pay your servants whatever you say is appropriate, for you know that we have no one among us who knows how to cut down trees like the Sidonians.”
1KI.5.7	 When Hiram heard Solomon’s message, he was very happy. He said, “The 
1KI.5.8	 Hiram then sent this message to Solomon: “I received
1KI.5.9	 My servants will bring the timber down from Lebanon to the sea. I will send it by sea in raft-like bundles to the place you designate.
1KI.5.10	 So Hiram supplied the cedars and evergreens Solomon needed,
1KI.5.11	 and Solomon supplied Hiram annually with 20,000 cors
1KI.5.12	 So the 
1KI.5.13	 King Solomon conscripted
1KI.5.14	 He sent them to Lebanon in shifts of 10,000 men per month. They worked in Lebanon for one month, and then spent two months at home. Adoniram was supervisor of
1KI.5.15	 Solomon also had 70,000 common laborers
1KI.5.16	 besides 3,300
1KI.5.17	 By royal order
1KI.5.18	 Solomon’s and Hiram’s construction workers,
1KI.6.1	 In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites left Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, during the month Ziv
1KI.6.2	 The temple King Solomon built for the 
1KI.6.3	 The porch in front of the main hall of the temple was 30 feet
1KI.6.4	 He made framed windows for the temple. 
1KI.6.5	 He built an extension all around the walls of the temple’s main hall and holy place and constructed side rooms in it.
1KI.6.6	 The bottom floor of the extension was seven and a half feet
1KI.6.7	 As the temple was being built, only stones shaped at the quarry
1KI.6.8	 The entrance to the bottom
1KI.6.9	 He finished building the temple
1KI.6.10	 He built an extension all around the temple; it was seven and a half feet high
1KI.6.11	 The 
1KI.6.12	 “As for this temple you are building, if you follow
1KI.6.13	 I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel.”
1KI.6.14	 So Solomon finished building the temple.
1KI.6.15	 He constructed the walls inside the temple with cedar planks; he paneled the inside with wood from the floor of the temple to the rafters
1KI.6.16	 He built a wall 30 feet in from the rear of the temple as a partition for an inner sanctuary that would be the most holy place.
1KI.6.17	 The main hall in front of the inner sanctuary was 60 feet long.
1KI.6.18	 The inside of the temple was all cedar and was adorned with carvings of round ornaments and of flowers in bloom. Everything was cedar; no stones were visible.
1KI.6.19	 He prepared the inner sanctuary inside the temple so that the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.6.20	 The inner sanctuary was 30 feet
1KI.6.21	 Solomon plated the inside of the temple with gold.
1KI.6.22	 He plated the entire inside of the temple with gold, as well as the altar inside the inner sanctuary.
1KI.6.23	 In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubs of olive wood; each stood 15 feet
1KI.6.24	 Each of the first cherub’s wings was seven and a half feet long; its entire wingspan was 15 feet.
1KI.6.25	 The second cherub also had a wingspan of 15 feet; it was identical to the first in measurements and shape.
1KI.6.26	 Each cherub stood 15 feet high.
1KI.6.27	 He put the cherubs in the inner sanctuary of the temple.
1KI.6.28	 He plated the cherubs with gold.
1KI.6.29	 On all the walls around the temple, inside and out,
1KI.6.30	 He plated the floor of the temple with gold, inside and out.
1KI.6.31	 He made doors of olive wood at the entrance to the inner sanctuary; the pillar on each doorpost was five-sided.
1KI.6.32	 On the two doors made of olive wood he carved
1KI.6.33	 In the same way he made doorposts of olive wood for the entrance to the main hall, only with four-sided pillars.
1KI.6.34	 He also made
1KI.6.35	 He carved cherubs, palm trees, and flowers in bloom and plated them with gold, leveled out over the carvings. 
1KI.6.36	 He built the inner courtyard with three rows of chiseled stones and a row of cedar beams.
1KI.6.37	 In the month Ziv
1KI.6.38	 In the eleventh year, in the month Bul
1KI.7.1	 Solomon took thirteen years to build his palace.
1KI.7.2	 He named
1KI.7.3	 The roof above the beams supported by the pillars was also made of cedar; there were forty-five beams, fifteen per row. 
1KI.7.4	 There were three rows of windows arranged in sets of three.
1KI.7.5	 All of the entrances
1KI.7.6	 He made a colonnade
1KI.7.7	 He also made a throne room, called “The Hall of Judgment,” where he made judicial decisions.
1KI.7.8	 The palace where he lived was constructed in a similar way.
1KI.7.9	 All of these were built with the best
1KI.7.10	 The foundation was made of large valuable stones, measuring either 15 feet or 12 feet.
1KI.7.11	 Above the foundation
1KI.7.12	 Around the great courtyard were three rows of chiseled stones and one row of cedar beams, like the inner courtyard of the 
1KI.7.13	 King Solomon sent for Hiram
1KI.7.14	 He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali,
1KI.7.15	 He fashioned two bronze pillars; each pillar was 27 feet
1KI.7.16	 He made two bronze tops for the pillars; each was seven-and-a-half feet high.
1KI.7.17	 The latticework on the tops of the pillars was adorned with ornamental wreaths and chains; the top of each pillar had seven groupings of ornaments.
1KI.7.18	 When he made the pillars, there were two rows of pomegranate-shaped ornaments around the latticework covering the top of each pillar.
1KI.7.19	 The tops of the two pillars in the porch were shaped like lilies and were six feet high.
1KI.7.20	 On the top of each pillar, right above the bulge beside the latticework, there were two hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments arranged in rows all the way around.
1KI.7.21	 He set up the pillars on the porch in front of the main hall. He erected one pillar on the right
1KI.7.22	 The tops of the pillars were shaped like lilies. So the construction of the pillars was completed.
1KI.7.23	 He also made the large bronze basin called “The Sea.”
1KI.7.24	 Under the rim all the way around it
1KI.7.25	 “The Sea” stood on top of twelve bulls. Three faced northward, three westward, three southward, and three eastward. “The Sea” was placed on top of them, and they all faced outward.
1KI.7.26	 It was four fingers thick and its rim was like that of a cup shaped like a lily blossom. It could hold about 12,000 gallons.
1KI.7.27	 He also made ten bronze movable stands. Each stand was six feet
1KI.7.28	 The stands were constructed with frames between the joints. 
1KI.7.29	 On these frames and joints were ornamental lions, bulls, and cherubs. Under the lions and bulls were decorative wreaths.
1KI.7.30	 Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles and four supports. Under the basin the supports were fashioned on each side with wreaths.
1KI.7.31	 Inside the stand was a round opening that was a foot-and-a-half deep; it had a support that was two and one-quarter feet long.
1KI.7.32	 The four wheels were under the frames and the crossbars of the axles were connected to the stand. Each wheel was two and one-quarter feet
1KI.7.33	 The wheels were constructed like chariot wheels; their crossbars, rims, spokes, and hubs were made of cast metal. 
1KI.7.34	 Each stand had four supports, one per side projecting out from the stand.
1KI.7.35	 On top of each stand was a round opening three-quarters of a foot deep;
1KI.7.36	 He engraved ornamental cherubs, lions, and palm trees on the plates of the supports and frames wherever there was room,
1KI.7.37	 He made the ten stands in this way. All of them were cast in one mold and were identical in measurements and shape.
1KI.7.38	 He also made ten bronze basins, each of which could hold about 240 gallons.
1KI.7.39	 He put five basins on the south side of the temple and five on the north side. He put “The Sea” on the south side, in the southeast corner. 
1KI.7.40	 Hiram also made basins, shovels, and bowls. He
1KI.7.41	 He made
1KI.7.42	 the four hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments for the latticework of the two pillars (each latticework had two rows of these ornaments at the bowl-shaped top of the pillar), 
1KI.7.43	 the ten movable stands with their ten basins, 
1KI.7.44	 the big bronze basin called “The Sea” with its twelve bulls underneath,
1KI.7.45	 and the pots, shovels, and bowls. All these items King Solomon assigned Hiram to make for the 
1KI.7.46	 The king had them cast in earth foundries
1KI.7.47	 Solomon left all these items unweighed; there were so many of them they did not weigh the bronze.
1KI.7.48	 Solomon also made all these items for the 
1KI.7.49	 the pure gold lampstands at the entrance to the inner sanctuary (five on the right and five on the left), the gold flower-shaped ornaments, lamps, and tongs, 
1KI.7.50	 the pure gold bowls, trimming shears, basins, pans, and censers, and the gold door sockets for the inner sanctuary (the most holy place) and for the doors of the main hall of the temple. 
1KI.7.51	 When King Solomon finished constructing the 
1KI.8.1	 Then Solomon convened in Jerusalem
1KI.8.2	 All the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon during the festival
1KI.8.3	 When all Israel’s elders had arrived, the priests lifted the ark. 
1KI.8.4	 The priests and Levites carried the ark of the 
1KI.8.5	 Now King Solomon and all the Israelites who had assembled with him went on ahead of the ark and sacrificed more sheep and cattle than could be counted or numbered.
1KI.8.6	 The priests brought the ark of the 
1KI.8.7	 The cherubs’ wings extended over the place where the ark sat; the cherubs overshadowed the ark and its poles.
1KI.8.8	 The poles were so long their ends were visible from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from beyond that point.
1KI.8.9	 There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets Moses had placed there in Horeb.
1KI.8.10	 Once the priests left the holy place, a cloud filled the 
1KI.8.11	 The priests could not carry out their duties
1KI.8.12	 Then Solomon said, “The 
1KI.8.13	 O 
1KI.8.14	 Then the king turned around
1KI.8.15	 He said, “The 
1KI.8.16	 He told David,
1KI.8.17	 Now my father David had a strong desire
1KI.8.18	 The 
1KI.8.19	 But you will not build the temple; your very own son will build the temple for my honor.’
1KI.8.20	 The 
1KI.8.21	 and set up in it a place for the ark containing the covenant the 
1KI.8.22	 Solomon stood before the altar of the 
1KI.8.23	 He prayed:
1KI.8.24	 You have kept your word to your servant, my father David;
1KI.8.25	 Now, O 
1KI.8.26	 Now, O God of Israel, may the promise you made
1KI.8.27	 “God does not really live on the earth!
1KI.8.28	 But respond favorably to
1KI.8.29	 Night and day may you watch over this temple, the place where you promised you would live.
1KI.8.30	 Respond to the request of your servant and your people Israel for this place.
1KI.8.31	 “When someone is accused of sinning against his neighbor and the latter pronounces a curse on the alleged offender before your altar in this temple, be willing to forgive the accused if the accusation is false.
1KI.8.32	 Listen from heaven and make a just decision about your servants’ claims. Condemn the guilty party, declare the other innocent, and give both of them what they deserve.
1KI.8.33	 “The time will come when
1KI.8.34	 then listen from heaven, forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them back to the land you gave to their ancestors.
1KI.8.35	 “The time will come when
1KI.8.36	 then listen from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Certainly
1KI.8.37	 “The time will come when the land suffers from a famine, a plague, blight and disease, or a locust
1KI.8.38	 When all your people Israel pray and ask for help,

1KI.9.21	 Their descendants remained in the land (the Israelites were unable to wipe them out completely). Solomon conscripted them for his work crews, and they continue in that role to this very day.
1KI.9.22	 Solomon did not assign Israelites to these work crews;
1KI.9.23	 These men were also in charge of Solomon’s work projects; there were a total of 550 men who supervised the workers.
1KI.9.24	 Solomon built the terrace as soon as Pharaoh’s daughter moved up from the city of David
1KI.9.25	 Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
1KI.9.26	 King Solomon also built ships

1KI.9.28	 They sailed
1KI.10.1	 When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon,
1KI.10.2	 She arrived in Jerusalem

1KI.10.19	 There were six steps leading up to the throne, and the back of it was rounded on top. The throne had two armrests with a statue of a lion standing on each side.
1KI.10.20	 There were twelve statues of lions on the six steps, one lion at each end of each step. There was nothing like it in any other kingdom.
1KI.10.21	 All of King Solomon’s cups were made of gold, and all the household items in the Palace of the Lebanon Forest were made of pure gold. There were no silver items, for silver was not considered very valuable in Solomon’s time.
1KI.10.22	 Along with Hiram’s fleet, the king had a fleet of large merchant ships

1KI.11.19	 Pharaoh liked Hadad so well
1KI.11.20	 Tahpenes’ sister gave birth to his son,
1KI.11.21	 While in Egypt Hadad heard that David had passed away

1KI.11.23	 God also brought against Solomon

1KI.11.25	 He was Israel’s enemy throughout Solomon’s reign and, like Hadad, caused trouble. He loathed
1KI.11.26	 Jeroboam son of Nebat, one of Solomon’s servants, rebelled against
1KI.11.27	 This is what prompted him to rebel against the king:
1KI.11.28	 Jeroboam was a talented man;
1KI.11.29	 At that time, when Jeroboam had left Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road; the two of them were alone in the open country. Ahijah

1KI.11.31	 Then he told Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces, for this is what the 
1KI.11.32	 He will retain one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. 
1KI.11.33	 I am taking the kingdom from him
1KI.11.34	 I will not take the whole kingdom from his hand. I will allow him to be ruler for the rest of his life for the sake of my chosen servant David who kept my commandments and rules. 
1KI.11.35	 I will take the kingdom from the hand of his son and give ten tribes to you.
1KI.11.36	 I will leave
1KI.11.37	 I will select
1KI.11.38	 You must obey
1KI.11.39	 I will humiliate David’s descendants because of this,
1KI.11.40	 Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam escaped to Egypt and found refuge with King Shishak of Egypt.
1KI.11.41	 The rest of the events of Solomon’s reign, including all his accomplishments and his wise decisions, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of Solomon.
1KI.11.42	 Solomon ruled over all Israel from Jerusalem
1KI.11.43	 Then Solomon passed away
1KI.12.1	 Rehoboam traveled to Shechem, for all Israel had gathered in
1KI.12.2	 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard the news, he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon and had been living ever since.
1KI.12.3	 They sent for him,
1KI.12.4	 “Your father made us work too hard.
1KI.12.5	 He said to them, “Go away for three days, then return to me.” So the people went away.
1KI.12.6	 King Rehoboam consulted with the older advisers who had served
1KI.12.7	 They said to him, “Today if you show a willingness to help these people and grant their request, they will be your servants from this time forward.”
1KI.12.8	 But Rehoboam rejected their advice and consulted the young advisers who served him, with whom he had grown up.
1KI.12.9	 He asked them, “How do you advise me
1KI.12.10	 The young advisers with whom Rehoboam
1KI.12.11	 My father imposed heavy demands on you; I will make them even heavier.
1KI.12.12	 Jeroboam and all the people reported
1KI.12.13	 The king responded to the people harshly. He rejected the advice of the older men 
1KI.12.14	 and followed
1KI.12.15	 The king refused to listen to the people, because the 
1KI.12.16	 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king, “We have no portion in David, no share in the son of Jesse!
1KI.12.17	 (Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.) 
1KI.12.18	 King Rehoboam sent Adoniram,
1KI.12.19	 So Israel has been in rebellion against the Davidic dynasty to this very day. 
1KI.12.20	 When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. No one except the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the Davidic dynasty.
1KI.12.21	 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he summoned 180,000 skilled warriors from all of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin
1KI.12.22	 But God told Shemaiah the prophet,
1KI.12.23	 “Say this to King Rehoboam son of Solomon of Judah, and to all Judah and Benjamin, as well as the rest of the people, 
1KI.12.24	 ‘The 
1KI.12.25	 Jeroboam built up Shechem in the Ephraimite hill country and lived there. From there he went out and built up Penuel. 
1KI.12.26	 Jeroboam then thought to himself:
1KI.12.27	 If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the 
1KI.12.28	 After the king had consulted with his advisers,
1KI.12.29	 He put one in Bethel
1KI.12.30	 This caused Israel to sin;
1KI.12.31	 He built temples
1KI.12.32	 Jeroboam inaugurated a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month,
1KI.12.33	 On the fifteenth day of the eighth month (a date he had arbitrarily chosen)
1KI.13.1	 Just then
1KI.13.2	 With the authority of the 
1KI.13.3	 That day he also announced
1KI.13.4	 When the king heard what the prophet

1KI.13.10	 So he started back on another road; he did not travel back on the same road he had taken to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	 Now there was an old prophet living in Bethel.
1KI.13.12	 Their father asked them, “Which road did he take?” His sons showed him
1KI.13.13	 He then told his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” When they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it 
1KI.13.14	 and took off after the prophet,
1KI.13.15	 He then said to him, “Come home with me and eat something.” 
1KI.13.16	 But he replied, “I can’t go back with you
1KI.13.17	 For the 
1KI.13.18	 The old prophet then said,

1KI.13.21	 and he cried out to the prophet from Judah, “This is what the 
1KI.13.22	 You went back and ate and drank in this place, even though he said to you, “Do not eat or drink there.”
1KI.13.23	 When the prophet from Judah finished his meal,
1KI.13.24	 As the prophet from Judah was traveling, a lion attacked him on the road and killed him.
1KI.13.25	 Some men came by
1KI.13.26	 When the old prophet who had invited him to his house heard the news,
1KI.13.27	 He told his sons, “Saddle my donkey,” and they did so.
1KI.13.28	 He went and found the corpse lying in the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside it;
1KI.13.29	 The old prophet
1KI.13.30	 He put the corpse into his own tomb, and they

1KI.14.2	 Jeroboam told his wife, “Disguise

1KI.14.6	 When Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, “Come on in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you pretending to be someone else? I have been commissioned to give you bad news.
1KI.14.7	 Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘This is what the 
1KI.14.8	 I tore the kingdom away from the Davidic dynasty and gave it to you. But you are not like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me wholeheartedly by doing only what I approve.

1KI.14.26	 He took away the treasures of the

1KI.15.2	 He ruled for three years in Jerusalem.

1KI.15.10	 He ruled for forty-one years in Jerusalem.
1KI.15.11	 Asa did what the 
1KI.15.12	 He removed the male cultic prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the disgusting idols
1KI.15.13	 He also removed Maacah his grandmother

1KI.15.17	 King Baasha of Israel attacked Judah and established Ramah as a military outpost to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the land of King Asa of Judah.
1KI.15.18	 Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the 
1KI.15.19	 “I want to make a treaty with you, like the one our fathers made.
1KI.15.20	 Ben Hadad accepted King Asa’s offer and ordered his army commanders to attack the cities of Israel.
1KI.15.21	 When Baasha heard the news, he stopped fortifying
1KI.15.22	 King Asa ordered all the men of Judah (no exemptions were granted) to carry away the stones and wood that Baasha had used to build Ramah.

1KI.15.28	 Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa’s reign over Judah and replaced him as king. 
1KI.15.29	 When he became king, he executed Jeroboam’s entire family. He wiped out everyone who breathed,

1KI.16.11	 When he became king and occupied the throne, he killed Baasha’s entire family. He did not spare any male belonging to him; he killed his relatives and his friends.
1KI.16.12	 Zimri destroyed Baasha’s entire family, just as the 
1KI.16.13	 This happened because of all the sins which Baasha and his son Elah committed and which they made Israel commit. They angered the

1KI.16.16	 While deployed there, the army received this report:
1KI.16.17	 Omri and all Israel went up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	 When Zimri saw that the city was captured, he went into the fortified area of the royal palace. He set the palace on fire and died in the flames.

1KI.16.32	 He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal he had built in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	 Ahab also made an Asherah pole; he

1KI.17.10	 So he got up and went to Zarephath. When he went through the city gate, there was a widow gathering wood. He called out to her, “Please give me a cup
1KI.17.11	 As she went to get it, he called out to her, “Please bring me a piece of bread.”
1KI.17.12	 She said, “As certainly as the 
1KI.17.13	 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do as you planned.
1KI.17.14	 For this is what the 
1KI.17.15	 She went and did as Elijah told her; there was always enough food for Elijah and for her and her family.
1KI.17.16	 The jar of flour was never empty and the jug of oil never ran out, just as the 
1KI.17.17	 After this
1KI.17.18	 She asked Elijah, “Why, prophet, have you come
1KI.17.19	 He said to her, “Hand me your son.” He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him down on his bed. 
1KI.17.20	 Then he called out to the 
1KI.17.21	 He stretched out over the boy three times and called out to the 
1KI.17.22	 The 
1KI.17.23	 Elijah took the boy, brought him down from the upper room to the house, and handed him to his mother. Elijah then said, “See, your son is alive!” 
1KI.17.24	 The woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a prophet and that the 
1KI.18.1	 Some time later, in the third year of the famine, the 
1KI.18.2	 So Elijah went to make an appearance before Ahab.
1KI.18.2	Now the famine was severe in Samaria.
1KI.18.3	 So Ahab summoned Obadiah, who supervised the palace. (Now Obadiah was a very loyal follower of the 
1KI.18.4	 When Jezebel was killing
1KI.18.5	 Ahab told Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grazing areas
1KI.18.6	 They divided up the land between them; Ahab went
1KI.18.7	 As Obadiah was traveling along, Elijah met him.
1KI.18.8	 He replied, “Yes,
1KI.18.9	 Obadiah
1KI.18.10	 As certainly as the 
1KI.18.11	 Now you say, ‘Go and say to your master, “Elijah is back.”’
1KI.18.12	 But when I leave you, the 
1KI.18.13	 Certainly my master is aware of what I did
1KI.18.14	 Now you say, ‘Go and say to your master, “Elijah is back,”’
1KI.18.15	 But Elijah said, “As certainly as the 
1KI.18.16	 When Obadiah went and informed Ahab, the king went to meet Elijah.
1KI.18.17	 When Ahab saw Elijah, he
1KI.18.18	 Elijah
1KI.18.19	 Now send out messengers
1KI.18.20	 Ahab sent messengers to all the Israelites and had the prophets assemble at Mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	 Elijah approached all the people and said, “How long are you going to be paralyzed by indecision?
1KI.18.22	 Elijah said to them:
1KI.18.23	 Let them bring us two bulls. Let them choose one of the bulls for themselves, cut it up into pieces, and place it on the wood. But they must not set it on fire. I will do the same to the other bull and place it on the wood. But I will not set it on fire. 
1KI.18.24	 Then you
1KI.18.25	 Elijah told the prophets of Baal, “Choose one of the bulls for yourselves and go first, for you are the majority. Invoke the name of your god, but do not light a fire.”
1KI.18.26	 So they took a bull, as he had suggested,
1KI.18.27	 At noon Elijah mocked them, “Yell louder! After all, he is a god; he may be deep in thought, or perhaps he stepped out for a moment or has taken a trip. Perhaps he is sleeping and needs to be awakened.”
1KI.18.28	 So they yelled louder and, in accordance with their prescribed ritual,
1KI.18.29	 Throughout the afternoon they were in an ecstatic frenzy,
1KI.18.30	 Elijah then told all the people, “Approach me.” So all the people approached him. He repaired the altar of the 
1KI.18.31	 Then Elijah took twelve stones, corresponding to the number of tribes that descended from Jacob, to whom the 
1KI.18.32	 With the stones he constructed an altar for the 
1KI.18.33	 He arranged the wood, cut up the bull, and placed it on the wood. 
1KI.18.34	 Then he said, “Fill four water jars and pour the water on the offering and the wood.” When they had done so,
1KI.18.35	 The water flowed down all sides of the altar and filled the trench. 
1KI.18.36	 When it was time for the evening offering,
1KI.18.37	 Answer me, O 
1KI.18.38	 Then fire from the 
1KI.18.39	 When all the people saw this, they threw themselves down with their faces to the ground and said, “The 
1KI.18.40	 Elijah told them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Don’t let even one of them escape!” So they seized them, and Elijah led them down to the Kishon Valley and executed
1KI.18.41	 Then Elijah told Ahab, “Go on up and eat and drink, for the sound of a heavy rainstorm can be heard.”
1KI.18.42	 So Ahab went on up to eat and drink, while Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel. He bent down toward the ground and put his face between his knees. 
1KI.18.43	 He told his servant, “Go on up and look in the direction of the sea.” So he went on up, looked, and reported, “There is nothing.”
1KI.18.44	 The seventh time the servant
1KI.18.45	 Meanwhile the sky was covered with dark clouds, the wind blew, and there was a heavy rainstorm. Ahab rode toward
1KI.18.46	 Now the 
1KI.19.1	 Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, including a detailed account of how he killed all the prophets with the sword. 
1KI.19.2	 Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah with this warning,
1KI.19.3	 Elijah was afraid,
1KI.19.4	 while he went a day’s journey into the desert. He went and sat down under a shrub
1KI.19.5	 He stretched out
1KI.19.6	 He looked and right there by his head was a cake baking on hot coals and a jug of water. He ate and drank and then slept some more.
1KI.19.7	 The 
1KI.19.8	 So he got up and ate and drank. That meal gave him the strength to travel forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.
1KI.19.9	 He went into a cave there and spent the night. All of a sudden the 
1KI.19.10	 He answered, “I have been absolutely loyal
1KI.19.11	 The 
1KI.19.11	A very powerful wind went before the 
1KI.19.12	 After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the 
1KI.19.13	 When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his robe and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. All of a sudden
1KI.19.14	 He answered, “I have been absolutely loyal
1KI.19.15	 The 
1KI.19.16	 You must anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to take your place as prophet. 
1KI.19.17	 Jehu will kill anyone who escapes Hazael’s sword, and Elisha will kill anyone who escapes Jehu’s sword. 
1KI.19.18	 I still have left in Israel seven thousand followers who have not bowed their knees to Baal or kissed the images of him.”
1KI.19.19	 Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen; he was near the twelfth pair. Elijah passed by him and threw his robe over him. 
1KI.19.20	 He left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, then I will follow you.” Elijah
1KI.19.21	 Elisha
1KI.20.1	 Now King Ben Hadad of Syria assembled all his army, along with thirty-two other kings with their horses and chariots. He marched against Samaria
1KI.20.2	 He sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel, who was in the city.
1KI.20.3	 He said to him, “This is what Ben Hadad says, ‘Your silver and your gold are mine, as well as the best of your wives and sons.’” 
1KI.20.4	 The king of Israel replied, “It is just as you say, my master, O king. I and all I own belong to you.”
1KI.20.5	 The messengers came again and said, “This is what Ben Hadad says, ‘I sent this message to you, “You must give me your silver, gold, wives, and sons.” 
1KI.20.6	 But now at this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you and they will search through your palace and your servants’ houses. They will carry away all your valuables.”
1KI.20.7	 The king of Israel summoned all the leaders
1KI.20.8	 All the leaders and people said to him, “Do not give in or agree to his demands.”
1KI.20.9	 So he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, “Say this to my master, the king, ‘I will give you everything you demanded at first from your servant, but I am unable to agree to this latest demand.’”
1KI.20.10	 Ben Hadad sent another message to him, “May the gods judge me severely
1KI.20.11	 The king of Israel replied, “Tell him the one who puts on his battle gear should not boast like one who is taking it off.”
1KI.20.12	 When Ben Hadad received this reply,
1KI.20.13	 Now a prophet visited King Ahab of Israel and said, “This is what the 
1KI.20.14	 Ahab asked, “By whom will this be accomplished?”
1KI.20.15	 So Ahab
1KI.20.16	 They marched out at noon, while Ben Hadad and the thirty-two kings allied with him were drinking heavily
1KI.20.17	 The servants of the district governors led the march. When Ben Hadad sent messengers, they reported back to him, “Men are marching out of Samaria.”
1KI.20.18	 He ordered, “Whether they come in peace or to do battle, take them alive.”
1KI.20.19	 They marched out of the city with the servants of the district governors in the lead and the army behind them. 
1KI.20.20	 Each one struck down an enemy soldier;
1KI.20.21	 Then the king of Israel marched out and struck down the horses and chariots; he thoroughly defeated
1KI.20.22	 The prophet
1KI.20.23	 Now the advisers
1KI.20.24	 So do this: Dismiss the kings from their command, and replace them with military commanders. 
1KI.20.25	 Muster an army like the one you lost, with the same number of horses and chariots.
1KI.20.26	 In the spring
1KI.20.27	 When the Israelites had mustered and had received their supplies, they marched out to face them in battle. When the Israelites deployed opposite them, they were like two small flocks
1KI.20.28	 The prophet
1KI.20.29	 The armies were deployed opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day the battle began, and the Israelites killed 100,000 Syrian foot soldiers in one day. 
1KI.20.30	 The remaining 27,000 ran to Aphek and went into the city, but the wall fell on them.
1KI.20.31	 His advisers
1KI.20.32	 So they put sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel. They said, “Your servant
1KI.20.33	 The men took this as a good omen and quickly accepted his offer, saying, “Ben Hadad is your brother.” Ahab
1KI.20.34	 Ben Hadad
1KI.20.35	 One of the members of the prophetic guild, speaking with divine authority, ordered his companion, “Wound me!”
1KI.20.36	 So the prophet
1KI.20.37	 He found another man and said, “Wound me!” So the man wounded him severely.
1KI.20.38	 The prophet then went and stood by the road, waiting for the king. He also disguised himself by putting a bandage down over his eyes. 
1KI.20.39	 When the king passed by, he called out to the king, “Your servant went out into the heat
1KI.20.40	 Well, it just so happened that while your servant was doing this and that, he disappeared.” The king of Israel said to him, “Your punishment is already determined by your own testimony.”
1KI.20.41	 The prophet
1KI.20.42	 The prophet
1KI.20.43	 The king of Israel went home to Samaria
1KI.21.1	 After this the following episode took place.
1KI.21.2	 Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard so I can make a vegetable garden out of it, for it is adjacent to my palace. I will give you an even better vineyard in its place, or if you prefer,
1KI.21.3	 But Naboth replied to Ahab, “The 
1KI.21.4	 So Ahab went into his palace, bitter and angry that Naboth the Jezreelite had said,
1KI.21.5	 Then his wife Jezebel came in and said to him, “Why do you have a bitter attitude and refuse to eat?” 
1KI.21.6	 He answered her, “While I was talking to Naboth the Jezreelite, I said to him, ‘Sell me your vineyard for silver, or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.’ But he said, ‘I will not sell you my vineyard.’”
1KI.21.7	 His wife Jezebel said to him, “You are the king of Israel!
1KI.21.8	 She wrote out orders,
1KI.21.9	 This is what she wrote:
1KI.21.10	 Also seat two villains opposite him and have them testify, ‘You cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out and stone him to death.” 
1KI.21.11	 The men of the
1KI.21.12	 They observed a time of fasting and put Naboth in front of the people. 
1KI.21.13	 The two villains arrived and sat opposite him. Then the villains testified against Naboth right before the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they dragged him
1KI.21.14	 Then they reported to Jezebel, “Naboth has been stoned to death.”
1KI.21.15	 When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she
1KI.21.16	 When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
1KI.21.17	 The 
1KI.21.18	 “Get up, go down and meet King Ahab of Israel who lives in Samaria. He is at the vineyard of Naboth; he has gone down there to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.19	 Say to him, ‘This is what the 
1KI.21.20	 When Elijah arrived, Ahab said to him,
1KI.21.21	 The 
1KI.21.22	 I will make your dynasty
1KI.21.23	 The 
1KI.21.24	 As for Ahab’s family, dogs will eat the ones
1KI.21.25	 (There had never been anyone like Ahab, who was firmly committed
1KI.21.26	 He was so wicked he worshiped the disgusting idols,
1KI.21.27	 When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted. He slept in sackcloth and walked around dejected. 
1KI.21.28	 The 
1KI.21.29	 “Have you noticed how Ahab shows remorse
1KI.22.1	 There was no war between Syria and Israel for three years.
1KI.22.2	 In the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah came down to visit
1KI.22.3	 The king of Israel said to his servants, “Surely you recognize that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us, though we are hesitant to reclaim it from the king of Syria.”
1KI.22.4	 Then he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to attack Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I will support you; my army and horses are at your disposal.”
1KI.22.5	 Then Jehoshaphat added,
1KI.22.6	 So the king of Israel assembled about four hundred prophets and asked them, “Should I attack Ramoth Gilead or not?”
1KI.22.7	 But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not a prophet of the 
1KI.22.8	 The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man through whom we can seek the 
1KI.22.9	 The king of Israel summoned an official and said, “Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah.” 
1KI.22.10	 Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their respective thrones,
1KI.22.11	 Zedekiah son of Kenaanah made iron horns and said, “This is what the 
1KI.22.12	 All the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Attack Ramoth Gilead! You will succeed; the 
1KI.22.13	 Now the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the prophets are in complete agreement that the king will succeed.
1KI.22.14	 But Micaiah said, “As certainly as the 
1KI.22.15	 When he came before the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth Gilead or not?” He answered him, “Attack! You will succeed; the 
1KI.22.16	 The king said to him, “How many times must I make you solemnly promise in
1KI.22.17	 Micaiah
1KI.22.18	 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster?” 
1KI.22.19	 Micaiah
1KI.22.20	 The 
1KI.22.21	 Then a spirit
1KI.22.22	 He replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ The 
1KI.22.23	 So now, look, the 
1KI.22.24	 Zedekiah son of Kenaanah approached, hit Micaiah on the jaw, and said, “Which way did the 
1KI.22.25	 Micaiah replied, “Look, you will see in the day when you go into an inner room to hide.” 
1KI.22.26	 Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the city official and Joash the king’s son. 
1KI.22.27	 Say, ‘This is what the king says, “Put this man in prison. Give him only a little bread and water
1KI.22.28	 Micaiah said, “If you really do safely return, then the 
1KI.22.29	 The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah attacked Ramoth Gilead. 
1KI.22.30	 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and then enter
1KI.22.31	 Now the king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight common soldiers or high-ranking officers;
1KI.22.32	 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “He must be the king of Israel.” So they turned and attacked him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. 
1KI.22.33	 When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him. 
1KI.22.34	 Now an archer shot an arrow at random,
1KI.22.35	 While the battle raged throughout the day, the king stood propped up in his chariot opposite the Syrians. He died in the evening; the blood from the wound ran down into the bottom of the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	 As the sun was setting, a cry went through the camp, “Each one should return to his city and to his homeland.” 
1KI.22.37	 So the king died and was taken to Samaria, where they buried him.
1KI.22.38	 They washed off the chariot at the pool of Samaria (this was where the prostitutes bathed);
1KI.22.39	 The rest of the events of Ahab’s reign, including a record of his accomplishments and how he built a luxurious palace and various cities, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
1KI.22.40	 Ahab passed away.
1KI.22.41	 In the fourth year of King Ahab’s reign over Israel, Asa’s son Jehoshaphat became king over Judah. 
1KI.22.42	 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem.
1KI.22.43	 He followed in his father Asa’s footsteps and was careful to do what the 
1KI.22.45	 The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, including his successes and military exploits, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
1KI.22.46	 He removed from the land any male cultic prostitutes who had managed to survive the reign of his father Asa.
1KI.22.47	 There was no king in Edom at this time; a governor ruled. 
1KI.22.48	 Jehoshaphat built a fleet of large merchant ships
1KI.22.49	 Then Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my sailors join yours in the fleet,”
1KI.22.50	 Jehoshaphat passed away
1KI.22.51	 In the seventeenth year of King Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Ahab’s son Ahaziah became king over Israel in Samaria.
1KI.22.52	 He did evil in the sight of
1KI.22.53	 He worshiped and bowed down to Baal,
2KI.1.1	 After Ahab died, Moab rebelled against Israel.
2KI.1.2	 Ahaziah fell through a window lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria
2KI.1.3	 But the 
2KI.1.4	 Therefore this is what the 
2KI.1.5	 When the messengers returned to the king,
2KI.1.6	 They replied,
2KI.1.7	 The king
2KI.1.8	 They replied,
2KI.1.9	 The king
2KI.1.10	 Elijah replied to the captain,
2KI.1.11	 The king
2KI.1.12	 Elijah replied to them,
2KI.1.13	 The king
2KI.1.14	 Indeed,
2KI.1.15	 The 
2KI.1.16	 Elijah
2KI.1.17	 He died just as the 
2KI.1.18	 The rest of the events of Ahaziah’s reign, including his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
2KI.2.1	 Just before
2KI.2.2	 Elijah told Elisha, “Stay here, for the 
2KI.2.3	 Some members of the prophetic guild
2KI.2.4	 Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here, for the 
2KI.2.5	 Some members of the prophetic guild in Jericho approached Elisha and said, “Do you know that today the 
2KI.2.6	 Elijah said to him, “Stay here, for the 
2KI.2.7	 The fifty members of the prophetic guild went and stood opposite them at a distance, while Elijah and Elisha
2KI.2.8	 Elijah took his cloak, folded it up, and hit the water with it. The water divided, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground. 
2KI.2.9	 When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “What can I do for you,
2KI.2.10	 Elijah
2KI.2.11	 As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a fiery chariot
2KI.2.12	 While Elisha was watching, he was crying out, “My father, my father! The chariot and horsemen of Israel!”
2KI.2.13	 He picked up Elijah’s cloak, which had fallen off him, and went back and stood on the shore of the Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	 He took the cloak that had fallen off Elijah,
2KI.2.15	 When the members of the prophetic guild in Jericho,
2KI.2.16	 They said to him, “Look, there are fifty capable men with your servants. Let them go and look for your master, for the wind sent from the 
2KI.2.17	 But they were so insistent, he became embarrassed. So he said, “Send them out.” They sent the fifty men out and they looked for three days, but could not find Elijah.
2KI.2.18	 When they came back, Elisha
2KI.2.19	 The men of the city said to Elisha, “Look, the city has a good location, as our
2KI.2.20	 Elisha
2KI.2.21	 He went out to the spring and threw the salt in. Then he said, “This is what the 
2KI.2.22	 The water has been pure to this very day, just as Elisha prophesied.
2KI.2.23	 He went up from there to Bethel.
2KI.2.24	 When he turned around and saw them, he called God’s judgment down on them.
2KI.2.25	 From there he traveled to Mount Carmel and then back to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	 In the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Ahab’s son Jehoram became king over Israel in Samaria;
2KI.3.2	 He did evil in the sight of
2KI.3.3	 Yet he persisted in
2KI.3.4	 Now King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder.
2KI.3.5	 When Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	 At that time King Jehoram left Samaria and assembled all Israel for war. 
2KI.3.7	 He sent
2KI.3.8	 He then asked, “Which invasion route are we going to take?”
2KI.3.9	 So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom
2KI.3.10	 The king of Israel said, “Oh no!
2KI.3.11	 Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the 
2KI.3.12	 Jehoshaphat said, “The 
2KI.3.13	 Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Why are you here?
2KI.3.14	 Elisha said, “As certainly as the 
2KI.3.15	 But now, get me a musician.”
2KI.3.16	 and he said, “This is what the 
2KI.3.17	 for this is what the 
2KI.3.18	 This is an easy task for the 
2KI.3.19	 You will defeat every fortified city and every important
2KI.3.20	 Sure enough, the next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water came flowing down from Edom and filled the land.
2KI.3.21	 Now all Moab had heard that the kings were attacking,
2KI.3.22	 When they got up early the next morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites, who were some distance away, the water looked red like blood. 
2KI.3.23	 The Moabites
2KI.3.24	 When they approached the Israelite camp, the Israelites rose up and struck down the Moabites, who then ran from them. The Israelites
2KI.3.25	 They tore down the cities and each man threw a stone into every cultivated field until they were covered.
2KI.3.25	Only Kir Hareseth was left intact,
2KI.3.26	 When the king of Moab realized he was losing the battle,
2KI.3.27	 So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice on the wall. There was an outburst of divine anger against Israel,
2KI.4.1	 Now a wife of one of the prophets
2KI.4.2	 Elisha said to her, “What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” She answered, “Your servant has nothing in the house except a small jar of olive oil.” 
2KI.4.3	 He said, “Go and ask all your neighbors for empty containers.
2KI.4.4	 Go and close the door behind you and your sons. Pour the olive oil into all the containers;
2KI.4.5	 So she left him and closed the door behind her and her sons. As they were bringing the containers to her, she was pouring the olive oil. 
2KI.4.6	 When the containers were full, she said to one of her sons,
2KI.4.7	 She went and told the prophet.
2KI.4.8	 One day Elisha traveled to Shunem, where a prominent
2KI.4.9	 She said to her husband, “Look, I’m sure
2KI.4.10	 Let’s make a small private upper room
2KI.4.11	 One day Elisha
2KI.4.12	 He told his servant Gehazi, “Ask the Shunammite woman to come here.”
2KI.4.13	 Elisha said to Gehazi,
2KI.4.14	 So he asked Gehazi,
2KI.4.15	 Elisha told him, “Ask her to come here.”
2KI.4.16	 He said, “About this time next year
2KI.4.17	 The woman did conceive, and at the specified time the next year she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.
2KI.4.18	 The boy grew and one day he went out to see his father who was with the harvest workers.
2KI.4.19	 He said to his father, “My head! My head!” His father
2KI.4.20	 So he picked him up and took him to his mother. He sat on her lap
2KI.4.21	 She went up and laid him down on the prophet’s
2KI.4.22	 She called to her husband, “Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so I can go see the prophet quickly and then return.” 
2KI.4.23	 He said, “Why do you want to go see him today? It is not the new moon
2KI.4.24	 She saddled the donkey and told her servant, “Lead on.
2KI.4.25	 So she went to visit
2KI.4.26	 Now, run to meet her and ask her, ‘Are you well? Are your husband and the boy well?’” She told Gehazi,
2KI.4.27	 But when she reached the prophet on the mountain, she grabbed hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to push her away, but the prophet said, “Leave her alone, for she is very upset.
2KI.4.28	 She said, “Did I ask my master for a son? Didn’t I say, ‘Don’t mislead me?’” 
2KI.4.29	 Elisha
2KI.4.30	 The mother of the child said, “As certainly as the 
2KI.4.31	 Now Gehazi went on ahead of them. He placed the staff on the child’s face, but there was no sound or response. When he came back to Elisha
2KI.4.32	 When Elisha arrived at the house, there was
2KI.4.33	 He went in by himself and closed the door.
2KI.4.34	 He got up on the bed and spread his body out over
2KI.4.35	 Elisha
2KI.4.36	 Elisha
2KI.4.37	 She came in, fell at his feet, and bowed down. Then she picked up her son and left.
2KI.4.38	 Now Elisha went back to Gilgal, while there was famine in the land. Some of the prophets were visiting him
2KI.4.39	 Someone went out to the field to gather some herbs and found a wild vine.
2KI.4.40	 The stew was poured out
2KI.4.41	 He said, “Get some flour.” Then he threw it into the pot and said, “Now pour some out for the men so they may eat.”
2KI.4.42	 Now a man from Baal Shalisha brought some food for the prophet
2KI.4.43	 But his attendant said, “How can I feed a hundred men with this?”
2KI.4.44	 So he set it before them; they ate and had some left over, just as the 
2KI.5.1	 Now Naaman, the commander of the king of Syria’s army, was esteemed and respected by his master,
2KI.5.2	 Raiding parties went out from Syria and took captive from the land of Israel a young girl, who became a servant to Naaman’s wife. 
2KI.5.3	 She told her mistress, “If only my master were in the presence of the prophet who is in Samaria!
2KI.5.4	 Naaman
2KI.5.5	 The king of Syria said, “Go! I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman
2KI.5.6	 He brought the letter to king of Israel. It read: “This is a letter of introduction for my servant Naaman,
2KI.5.7	 When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God? Can I kill or restore life? Why does he ask me to cure a man of his skin disease?
2KI.5.8	 When Elisha the prophet
2KI.5.9	 So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood in the doorway of Elisha’s house. 
2KI.5.10	 Elisha sent out a messenger who told him, “Go and wash seven times in the Jordan; your skin will be restored
2KI.5.11	 Naaman went away angry. He said, “Look, I thought for sure he would come out, stand there, invoke the name of the 
2KI.5.12	 The rivers of Damascus, the Abana and Pharpar, are better than any of the waters of Israel!
2KI.5.13	 His servants approached and said to him, “O master,
2KI.5.14	 So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, as the prophet had instructed.
2KI.5.15	 He and his entire entourage returned to the prophet. Naaman
2KI.5.16	 But Elisha
2KI.5.17	 Naaman said, “If not, then please give your servant a load of dirt, enough for a pair of mules to carry,
2KI.5.18	 May the 
2KI.5.19	 Elisha
2KI.5.19	When he had gone a short distance,
2KI.5.20	 Gehazi, the prophet Elisha’s servant, thought,
2KI.5.21	 So Gehazi ran after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?”
2KI.5.22	 He answered, “Everything is fine.
2KI.5.23	 Naaman said, “Please accept two talents of silver.
2KI.5.24	 When he arrived at the hill, he took them from the servants
2KI.5.25	 When he came and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” He answered, “Your servant hasn’t been anywhere.” 
2KI.5.26	 Elisha
2KI.5.27	 Therefore Naaman’s skin disease will afflict
2KI.6.1	 Some of the prophets
2KI.6.2	 Let’s go to the Jordan. Each of us will get a log from there and we will build a meeting place for ourselves there.” He said, “Go.” 
2KI.6.3	 One of them said, “Please come along with your servants.” He replied, “All right, I’ll come.” 
2KI.6.4	 So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they started cutting down trees. 
2KI.6.5	 As one of them was felling a log, the ax head
2KI.6.6	 The prophet
2KI.6.7	 He said, “Lift it out.” So he reached out his hand and grabbed it.
2KI.6.8	 Now the king of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted his advisers, who said, “Invade
2KI.6.9	 But the prophet sent this message to the king of Israel, “Make sure you don’t pass through this place because Syria is invading there.” 
2KI.6.10	 So the king of Israel sent a message to the place the prophet had pointed out, warning it
2KI.6.11	 This made the king of Syria upset.
2KI.6.12	 One of his advisers said, “No, my master, O king. The prophet Elisha who lives in Israel keeps telling the king of Israel the things you say in your bedroom.” 
2KI.6.13	 The king
2KI.6.14	 So he sent horses and chariots there, along with a good-sized army.
2KI.6.15	 The prophet’s
2KI.6.16	 He replied, “Don’t be afraid, for our side outnumbers them.”
2KI.6.17	 Then Elisha prayed, “O 
2KI.6.18	 As they approached him,
2KI.6.19	 Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the right road or city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you’re looking for.” He led them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	 When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O 
2KI.6.21	 When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “Should I strike them down,
2KI.6.22	 He replied, “Do not strike them down! You did not capture them with your sword or bow, so what gives you the right to strike them down?
2KI.6.23	 So he threw a big banquet
2KI.6.24	 Later King Ben Hadad of Syria assembled his entire army and attacked
2KI.6.25	 Samaria’s food supply ran out.
2KI.6.26	 While the king of Israel was passing by on the city wall, a woman shouted to him, “Help us, my master, O king!” 
2KI.6.27	 He replied, “No, let the 
2KI.6.28	 Then the king asked her, “What’s your problem?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Hand over your son; we’ll eat him today and then eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	 So we boiled my son and ate him. Then I said to her the next day, ‘Hand over your son and we’ll eat him.’ But she hid her son!” 
2KI.6.30	 When the king heard what the woman said, he tore his clothes. As he was passing by on the wall, the people could see he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes.
2KI.6.31	 Then he said, “May God judge me severely
2KI.6.32	 Now Elisha was sitting in his house with the community leaders.
2KI.6.33	 He was still talking to them when
2KI.7.1	 Elisha replied, “Hear the word of the 
2KI.7.2	 An officer who was the king’s right-hand man
2KI.7.3	 Now four men with a skin disease
2KI.7.4	 If we go into the city, we’ll die of starvation,
2KI.7.5	 So they started toward
2KI.7.6	 The 
2KI.7.7	 So they got up and fled at dusk, leaving behind their tents, horses, and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives. 
2KI.7.8	 When the men with a skin disease reached the edge of the camp, they entered a tent and had a meal.
2KI.7.9	 Then they said to one another, “It’s not right what we’re doing! This is a day to celebrate, but we haven’t told anyone.
2KI.7.10	 So they went and called out to the gatekeepers
2KI.7.11	 The gatekeepers relayed the news to the royal palace.
2KI.7.12	 The king got up in the night and said to his advisers,
2KI.7.13	 One of his advisers replied, “Pick some men and have them take five of the horses that are left in the city. (Even if they are killed, their fate will be no different than that of all the Israelite people – we’re all going to die!)
2KI.7.14	 So they picked two horsemen and the king sent them out to track the Syrian army.
2KI.7.15	 So they tracked them
2KI.7.16	 Then the people went out and looted the Syrian camp. A seah
2KI.7.17	 Now the king had placed the officer who was his right-hand man
2KI.7.18	 The prophet told the king, “Two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel, and a seah of finely milled flour for a shekel; this will happen about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria.” 
2KI.7.19	 But the officer replied to the prophet, “Look, even if the 
2KI.7.20	 This is exactly what happened to him. The people trampled him to death in the city gate.
2KI.8.1	 Now Elisha advised the woman whose son he had brought back to life, “You and your family should go and live somewhere else for a while,
2KI.8.2	 So the woman did as the prophet said.
2KI.8.3	 After seven years the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went to ask the king to give her back her house and field.
2KI.8.4	 Now the king was talking to Gehazi, the prophet’s
2KI.8.5	 While Gehazi
2KI.8.6	 The king asked the woman about it, and she gave him the details.
2KI.8.7	 Elisha traveled to Damascus while King Ben Hadad of Syria was sick. The king
2KI.8.8	 So the king told Hazael, “Take a gift
2KI.8.9	 So Hazael went to visit Elisha.
2KI.8.10	 Elisha said to him, “Go and tell him, ‘You will surely recover,’
2KI.8.11	 Elisha
2KI.8.12	 Hazael asked, “Why are you crying, my master?” He replied, “Because I know the trouble you will cause the Israelites. You will set fire to their fortresses, kill their young men with the sword, smash their children to bits, and rip open their pregnant women.” 
2KI.8.13	 Hazael said, “How could your servant, who is as insignificant as a dog, accomplish this great military victory?”
2KI.8.14	 He left Elisha and went to his master. Ben Hadad
2KI.8.15	 The next day Hazael
2KI.8.16	 In the fifth year of the reign of Israel’s King Joram, son of Ahab, Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram became king over Judah.
2KI.8.17	 He was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
2KI.8.18	 He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel, just as Ahab’s dynasty had done, for he married Ahab’s daughter.
2KI.8.19	 But the 
2KI.8.20	 During his reign Edom freed themselves from Judah’s control and set up their own king.
2KI.8.21	 Joram
2KI.8.22	 So Edom has remained free from Judah’s control to this very day.
2KI.8.23	 The rest of the events of Joram’s reign, including a record of his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
2KI.8.24	 Joram passed away
2KI.8.25	 In the twelfth year of the reign of Israel’s King Joram, son of Ahab, Jehoram’s son Ahaziah became king over Judah. 
2KI.8.26	 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem.
2KI.8.27	 He followed in the footsteps of Ahab’s dynasty and did evil in the sight of
2KI.8.28	 He joined Ahab’s son Joram in a battle against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth Gilead in which the Syrians defeated Joram. 
2KI.8.29	 King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians
2KI.9.1	 Now Elisha the prophet summoned a member of the prophetic guild
2KI.9.2	 When you arrive there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi and take him aside into an inner room.
2KI.9.3	 Take the container of olive oil, pour it over his head, and say, ‘This is what the 
2KI.9.4	 So the young prophet
2KI.9.5	 When he arrived, the officers of the army were sitting there.
2KI.9.6	 So Jehu
2KI.9.7	 You will destroy the family of your master Ahab.
2KI.9.8	 Ahab’s entire family will die. I
2KI.9.9	 I will make Ahab’s dynasty
2KI.9.10	 Dogs will devour Jezebel on the plot of ground in Jezreel; she will not be buried.’”
2KI.9.11	 When Jehu rejoined
2KI.9.12	 But they said, “You’re lying! Tell us what he said.” So he told them what he had said. He also related how he had said,
2KI.9.13	 Each of them quickly took off his cloak and they spread them out at Jehu’s
2KI.9.14	 Then Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi conspired against Joram.
2KI.9.14	Now Joram had been in Ramoth Gilead with the whole Israelite army,
2KI.9.15	 But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians
2KI.9.16	 Jehu drove his chariot
2KI.9.17	 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and saw Jehu’s troops approaching.
2KI.9.18	 So the horseman
2KI.9.19	 So he sent a second horseman out to them
2KI.9.20	 The watchman reported, “He reached them, but hasn’t started back. The one who drives the lead chariot drives like Jehu son of Nimshi;
2KI.9.21	 Jehoram ordered, “Hitch up my chariot.”
2KI.9.22	 When Jehoram saw Jehu, he asked, “Is everything all right, Jehu?” He replied, “How can everything be all right as long as your mother Jezebel promotes idolatry and pagan practices?”
2KI.9.23	 Jehoram turned his chariot around and took off.
2KI.9.24	 Jehu aimed his bow and shot an arrow right between Jehoram’s shoulders.
2KI.9.25	 Jehu ordered
2KI.9.26	 ‘“Know for sure that I saw the shed blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday,” says the 
2KI.9.27	 When King Ahaziah of Judah saw what happened, he took off
2KI.9.28	 His servants took his body
2KI.9.29	 Ahaziah had become king over Judah in the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab.
2KI.9.30	 Jehu approached Jezreel. When Jezebel heard the news, she put on some eye liner,
2KI.9.31	 When Jehu came through the gate, she said, “Is everything all right, Zimri, murderer of his master?”
2KI.9.32	 He looked up at the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three
2KI.9.33	 He said, “Throw her down!” So they threw her down, and when she hit the ground,
2KI.9.34	 He went inside and had a meal.
2KI.9.35	 But when they went to bury her, they found nothing left but
2KI.9.36	 When they went back and told him, he said, “The 
2KI.9.37	 Jezebel’s corpse will be like manure on the surface of the ground in the plot of land at Jezreel. People will not be able to even recognize her.’”
2KI.10.1	 Ahab had seventy sons living in Samaria.
2KI.10.2	 “You have with you the sons of your master, chariots and horses, a fortified city, and weapons. So when this letter arrives,
2KI.10.3	 pick the best and most capable
2KI.10.4	 They were absolutely terrified
2KI.10.5	 So the palace supervisor,
2KI.10.6	 He wrote them a second letter, saying, “If you are really on my side and are willing to obey me,
2KI.10.7	 When they received the letter, they seized the king’s sons and executed all seventy of them.
2KI.10.8	 The messenger came and told Jehu,
2KI.10.9	 In the morning he went out and stood there. Then he said to all the people, “You are innocent. I conspired against my master and killed him. But who struck down all of these men? 
2KI.10.10	 Therefore take note that not one of the judgments the 
2KI.10.11	 Then Jehu killed all who were left of Ahab’s family in Jezreel, and all his nobles, close friends, and priests. He left no survivors.
2KI.10.12	 Jehu then left there and set out for Samaria.
2KI.10.13	 Jehu encountered
2KI.10.14	 He said, “Capture them alive!” So they captured them alive and then executed all forty-two of them in the cistern at Beth Eked. He left no survivors.
2KI.10.15	 When he left there, he met
2KI.10.16	 Jehu
2KI.10.17	 He went to Samaria and exterminated all the members of Ahab’s family who were still alive in Samaria,
2KI.10.18	 Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, “Ahab worshiped
2KI.10.19	 So now, bring to me all the prophets of Baal, as well as all his servants and priests.
2KI.10.20	 Then Jehu ordered, “Make arrangements for
2KI.10.21	 Jehu sent invitations throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one was absent. They arrived at the temple of Baal and filled it up from end to end.
2KI.10.22	 Jehu ordered the one who was in charge of the wardrobe,
2KI.10.23	 Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went to the temple of Baal. Jehu
2KI.10.24	 They went inside to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside. He had told them, “If any of the men inside get away, you will pay with your lives!”
2KI.10.25	 When he finished offering the burnt sacrifice, Jehu ordered the royal guard
2KI.10.26	 They hauled out the sacred pillar of the temple of Baal and burned it. 
2KI.10.27	 They demolished
2KI.10.28	 So Jehu eradicated Baal worship
2KI.10.29	 However, Jehu did not repudiate the sins which Jeroboam son of Nebat had encouraged Israel to commit; the golden calves remained in Bethel
2KI.10.30	 The 
2KI.10.31	 But Jehu did not carefully and wholeheartedly obey the law of the 
2KI.10.32	 In those days the 
2KI.10.33	 He conquered all the land of Gilead, including the territory of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, extending all the way from the Aroer in the Arnon Valley through Gilead to Bashan.
2KI.10.34	 The rest of the events of Jehu’s reign, including all his accomplishments and successes, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
2KI.10.35	 Jehu passed away
2KI.10.36	 Jehu reigned over Israel for twenty-eight years in Samaria.
2KI.11.1	 When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she was determined to destroy the entire royal line.
2KI.11.2	 So Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah, took Ahaziah’s son Joash and sneaked
2KI.11.3	 He hid out with his nurse in the 
2KI.11.4	 In the seventh year Jehoiada summoned
2KI.11.5	 He ordered them, “This is what you must do. One third of the unit that is on duty during the Sabbath will guard the royal palace. 
2KI.11.6	 Another third of you will be stationed at the Foundation
2KI.11.7	 The two units who are off duty on the Sabbath will guard the 
2KI.11.8	 You must surround the king. Each of you must hold his weapon in his hand. Whoever approaches your ranks must be killed. You must accompany the king wherever he goes.”
2KI.11.9	 The officers of the units of hundreds did just as
2KI.11.10	 The priest gave to the officers of the units of hundreds King David’s spears and the shields that were kept in the 
2KI.11.11	 The royal bodyguard
2KI.11.12	 Jehoiada

2KI.11.14	 Then she saw
2KI.11.15	 Jehoiada the priest ordered the officers of the units of hundreds, who were in charge of the army,
2KI.11.16	 They seized her and took her into the precincts of the royal palace through the horses’ entrance.
2KI.11.17	 Jehoiada then drew up a covenant between the 
2KI.11.18	 All the people of the land went and demolished
2KI.11.19	 He took the officers of the units of hundreds, the Carians, the royal bodyguard, and all the people of land, and together they led the king down from the 
2KI.11.20	 All the people of the land celebrated, for the city had rest now that they had killed Athaliah with the sword in the royal palace.
2KI.12.2	 Throughout his lifetime Jehoash did what the 
2KI.12.3	 But the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places.
2KI.12.4	 Jehoash said to the priests, “I place at your disposal
2KI.12.5	 The priests should receive the silver they need from the treasurers and repair any damage to the temple they discover.”
2KI.12.6	 By the twenty-third year of King Jehoash’s reign the priests had still not repaired the damage to the temple. 
2KI.12.7	 So King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest along with the other priests, and said to them, “Why have you not repaired the damage to the temple? Now, take no more silver from your treasurers unless you intend to use it to repair the damage.”
2KI.12.8	 The priests agreed
2KI.12.9	 Jehoiada the priest took a chest and drilled a hole in its lid. He placed it on the right side of the altar near the entrance of
2KI.12.10	 When they saw the chest was full of silver, the royal secretary
2KI.12.11	 They would then hand over
2KI.12.12	 as well as masons and stonecutters. They bought wood and chiseled stone to repair the damage to the

2KI.12.20	 His servants conspired against him
2KI.12.21	 His servants Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer murdered him.
2KI.13.1	 In the twenty-third year of the reign of Judah’s King Joash son of Ahaziah, Jehu’s son Jehoahaz became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria

2KI.19.23	I invaded its most remote regions,

2KI.19.25	Certainly you must have heard!
2KI.19.25	Long ago I worked it out,
2KI.19.25	In ancient times I planned
2KI.19.25	and now I am bringing it to pass.
2KI.19.25	The plan is this:
2KI.19.25	Fortified cities will crash
2KI.19.25	into heaps of ruins.

2KI.19.26	they are terrified and ashamed.
2KI.19.26	They are as short-lived as plants in the field,
2KI.19.26	or green vegetation.
2KI.19.26	They are as short-lived as grass on the rooftops
2KI.19.26	when it is scorched by the east wind.
2KI.19.27	 I know where you live,
2KI.19.27	and everything you do.
2KI.19.28	 Because you rage against me,
2KI.19.28	and the uproar you create has reached my ears;

2KI.19.28	you came.”
2KI.19.29	 This will be your confirmation that I have spoken the truth:
2KI.19.30	 Those who remain in Judah will take root in the ground and bear fruit.
2KI.19.31	 For a remnant will leave Jerusalem;

1CH.12.18	So David accepted them and made them leaders of raiding bands.
1CH.12.19	 Some men from Manasseh joined
1CH.12.20	 When David
1CH.12.21	 They helped David fight against raiding bands, for all of them were warriors and leaders in the army.

1CH.13.2	 David said to the whole Israelite assembly, “If you so desire and the 
1CH.13.3	 Let’s move the ark of our God back here,
1CH.13.4	 The whole assembly agreed to do this,
1CH.13.5	 So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor River
1CH.13.6	 David and all Israel went up to Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim) in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God the 
1CH.13.7	 They transported the ark on a new cart from the house of Abinadab; Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the cart, 
1CH.13.8	 while David and all Israel were energetically
1CH.13.9	 When they arrived at the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to take hold of
1CH.13.10	 The 
1CH.13.11	 David was angry because the 
1CH.13.12	 David was afraid of God that day and said, “How will I ever be able to bring the ark of God up here?” 
1CH.13.13	 So David did not move the ark to the City of David;
1CH.13.14	 The ark of God remained in Obed-Edom’s house for three months; the 
1CH.14.1	 King Hiram of Tyre
1CH.14.2	 David realized that the

1CH.14.8	 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed
1CH.14.9	 Now the Philistines had come and raided
1CH.14.10	 David asked God, “Should I march up against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?” The 
1CH.14.11	 So they marched against Baal Perazim and David defeated them there. David said, “Using me as his instrument,
1CH.14.12	 The Philistines left
1CH.14.13	 The Philistines again raided the valley. 
1CH.14.14	 So David again asked God what he should do.
1CH.14.15	 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the trees, then attack.
1CH.14.16	 David did just as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
1CH.14.17	 So David became famous
1CH.15.1	 David constructed buildings in the City of David; he then prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. 
1CH.15.2	 Then David said, “Only the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the 
1CH.15.3	 David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem
1CH.15.4	 David gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
1CH.15.5	 From the descendants of Kohath: Uriel the leader and 120 of his relatives.

1CH.15.11	 David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, along with the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 
1CH.15.12	 He told them: “You are the leaders of the Levites’ families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves and bring the ark of the 
1CH.15.13	 The first time you did not carry it; that is why the 
1CH.15.14	 The priests and Levites consecrated themselves so they could bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.15	 The descendants of Levi carried the ark of God on their shoulders with poles, just as Moses had ordered according to the divine command.
1CH.15.16	 David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint some of their relatives as musicians; they were to play various instruments, including stringed instruments and cymbals, and to sing loudly and joyfully.
1CH.15.17	 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; one of his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah; one of the descendants of Merari,
1CH.15.18	 along with some of their relatives who were second in rank, including Zechariah,
1CH.15.19	 The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals;

1CH.15.25	 So David, the leaders of Israel, and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.26	 When God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the 
1CH.15.27	 David was wrapped in a linen robe, as were all the Levites carrying the ark, the musicians, and Kenaniah the supervisor of transport and the musicians;
1CH.15.28	 All Israel brought up the ark of the 
1CH.15.29	 As the ark of the 
1CH.16.1	 They brought the ark of God and put it in the middle of the tent David had pitched for it. Then they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings
1CH.16.2	 When David finished offering burnt sacrifices and peace offerings, he pronounced a blessing over the people in the 
1CH.16.3	 He then handed out to each Israelite man and woman a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake. 
1CH.16.4	 He appointed some of the Levites to serve before the ark of the 
1CH.16.5	 Asaph was the leader and Zechariah second in command, followed by Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel. They were to play stringed instruments; Asaph was to sound the cymbals; 
1CH.16.6	 and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of God’s covenant.
1CH.16.7	 That day David first gave to Asaph and his colleagues this song of thanks to the

1CH.19.8	 When David heard the news, he sent Joab and the entire army to meet them.
1CH.19.9	 The Ammonites marched out and were deployed for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. 
1CH.19.10	 When Joab saw that the battle would be fought on two fronts, he chose some of Israel’s best men and deployed them against the Arameans.
1CH.19.11	 He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the army and they were deployed against the Ammonites.

2CH.10.12	 Jeroboam and all the people reported to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had ordered when he said, “Return to me on the third day.” 
2CH.10.13	 The king responded to the people harshly. He
2CH.10.14	 and followed the advice of the younger ones. He said, “My father imposed heavy demands on you;
2CH.10.15	 The king refused to listen to the people, because God was instigating this turn of events
2CH.10.16	 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king, “We have no portion in David – no share in the son of Jesse!
2CH.10.17	 (Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.) 
2CH.10.18	 King Rehoboam sent Hadoram,
2CH.10.19	 So Israel has been in rebellion against the Davidic dynasty to this very day.
2CH.11.1	 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he summoned 180,000 skilled warriors from Judah and Benjamin
2CH.11.2	 But the 
2CH.11.3	 “Say this to King Rehoboam son of Solomon of Judah and to all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin, 
2CH.11.4	 ‘The 
2CH.11.5	 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem;
2CH.11.6	 Bethlehem,
2CH.11.7	 Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These were the fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	 He fortified these cities and placed officers in them, as well as storehouses of food, olive oil, and wine. 
2CH.11.12	 In each city there were shields and spears; he strongly fortified them.
2CH.11.13	 The priests and Levites who lived throughout Israel supported him, no matter where they resided.
2CH.11.14	 The Levites even left their pasturelands and their property behind and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons prohibited them from serving as the 
2CH.11.15	 Jeroboam
2CH.11.16	 Those among all the Israelite tribes who were determined to worship the 
2CH.11.17	 They supported
2CH.11.18	 Rehoboam married
2CH.11.19	 She bore him sons named Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	 He later married Maacah the daughter of Absalom. She bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	 Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than his other wives and concubines.
2CH.11.22	 Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as the leader over his brothers, for he intended to name him his successor.
2CH.11.23	 He wisely placed some of his many sons throughout the regions of Judah and Benjamin in the various fortified cities.
2CH.12.1	 After Rehoboam’s rule was established and solidified, he and all Israel rejected the law of the 
2CH.12.2	 Because they were unfaithful to the 
2CH.12.3	 He had 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen, and an innumerable number of soldiers who accompanied him from Egypt, including Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites. 
2CH.12.4	 He captured the fortified cities of Judah and marched against Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	 Shemaiah the prophet visited Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who were assembled in Jerusalem because of Shishak. He said to them, “This is what the 
2CH.12.6	 The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The 
2CH.12.7	 When the 
2CH.12.8	 Yet they will become his subjects, so they can experience how serving me differs from serving the surrounding nations.”
2CH.12.9	 King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the 
2CH.12.10	 King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned them to the officers of the royal guard
2CH.12.11	 Whenever the king visited the 
2CH.12.12	 So when Rehoboam
2CH.12.13	 King Rehoboam solidified his rule in Jerusalem;
2CH.12.14	 He did evil because he was not determined to follow the 
2CH.12.15	 The events of Rehoboam’s reign, from start to finish, are recorded
2CH.12.16	 Then Rehoboam passed away
2CH.13.1	 In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah. 
2CH.13.2	 He ruled for three years in Jerusalem.
2CH.13.2	There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	 Abijah launched the attack with 400,000 well-trained warriors,
2CH.13.4	 Abijah ascended Mount Zemaraim, in the Ephraimite hill country, and said: “Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel! 
2CH.13.5	 Don’t you realize that the 
2CH.13.6	 Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master. 
2CH.13.7	 Lawless good-for-nothing men
2CH.13.8	 Now you are declaring that you will resist the 
2CH.13.9	 But you banished
2CH.13.10	 But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	 They offer burnt sacrifices to the 
2CH.13.12	 Now look, God is with us as our leader. His priests are ready to blow the trumpets to signal the attack against you.
2CH.13.13	 Now Jeroboam had sent some men to ambush the Judahite army from behind.
2CH.13.14	 The men of Judah turned around and realized they were being attacked from the front and the rear.
2CH.13.15	 and the men of Judah gave
2CH.13.16	 The Israelites fled from before the Judahite army,
2CH.13.17	 Abijah and his army thoroughly defeated them;
2CH.13.18	 That day
2CH.13.19	 Abijah chased Jeroboam; he seized from him these cities: Bethel
2CH.13.20	 Jeroboam did not regain power during the reign of Abijah.
2CH.13.21	 Abijah’s power grew; he had
2CH.13.22	 The rest of the events of Abijah’s reign, including his deeds and sayings,
2CH.14.3	 He removed the pagan altars
2CH.14.4	 He ordered Judah to seek the 
2CH.14.5	 He removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah. The kingdom had rest under his rule.
2CH.14.6	 He built fortified cities throughout Judah, for the land was at rest and there was no war during those years; the 
2CH.14.7	 He said to the people of Judah:
2CH.14.8	 Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, equipped with large shields and spears. He also had 280,000 men from Benjamin who carried small shields and were adept archers; they were all skilled warriors. 
2CH.14.9	 Zerah the Cushite marched against them with an army of 1,000,000
2CH.14.10	 and Asa went out to oppose him. They deployed for battle in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah. 
2CH.14.11	 Asa prayed
2CH.14.12	 The 
2CH.14.13	 and Asa and his army chased them as far as Gerar. The Cushites were wiped out;
2CH.14.14	 They defeated all the cities surrounding Gerar, for the 
2CH.14.15	 They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen in charge of the livestock.
2CH.15.1	 God’s Spirit came upon Azariah son of Oded. 
2CH.15.2	 He met
2CH.15.3	 For a long time
2CH.15.4	 Because of their distress, they turned back to the 
2CH.15.5	 In those days
2CH.15.6	 One nation was crushed by another, and one city by another, for God caused them to be in great turmoil.
2CH.15.7	 But as for you, be strong and don’t get discouraged,
2CH.15.8	 When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he was encouraged.
2CH.15.9	 He assembled all Judah and Benjamin, as well as the settlers
2CH.15.10	 They assembled in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign. 
2CH.15.11	 At that time
2CH.15.12	 They solemnly agreed
2CH.15.13	 Anyone who would not seek the 
2CH.15.14	 They swore their allegiance to the 
2CH.15.15	 All Judah was happy about the oath, because they made the vow with their whole heart. They willingly sought the 
2CH.15.16	 King Asa also removed Maacah his grandmother
2CH.15.17	 The high places were not eliminated from Israel, yet Asa was wholeheartedly devoted to the 
2CH.15.18	 He brought the holy items that his father and he had made into God’s temple, including the silver, gold, and other articles.
2CH.15.19	 There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign. 
2CH.16.1	 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, King Baasha of Israel attacked Judah, and he established Ramah as a military outpost to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the land of King Asa of Judah.
2CH.16.2	 Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the 
2CH.16.3	 “I want to make a treaty with you, like the one our fathers made.
2CH.16.4	 Ben Hadad accepted King Asa’s offer and ordered his army commanders to attack the cities of Israel.
2CH.16.5	 When Baasha heard the news, he stopped fortifying
2CH.16.6	 King Asa ordered all the men of Judah to carry away the stones and wood that Baasha had used to build Ramah.
2CH.16.7	 At that time Hanani the prophet
2CH.16.8	 Did not the Cushites and Libyans have a huge army with chariots and a very large number of horsemen? But when you relied on the 
2CH.16.9	 Certainly
2CH.16.10	 Asa was so angry at the prophet, he put him in jail.
2CH.16.11	 The events of Asa’s reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2CH.16.12	 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a foot disease.
2CH.16.13	 Asa passed away
2CH.16.14	 He was buried in the tomb he had carved out in the City of David.
2CH.17.1	 His son Jehoshaphat replaced him as king and solidified his rule over Israel.
2CH.17.2	 He placed troops in all of Judah’s fortified cities and posted garrisons
2CH.17.3	 The 
2CH.17.4	 but instead sought the God of his ancestors
2CH.17.5	 The 
2CH.17.6	 He was committed to following the 
2CH.17.7	 In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah. 
2CH.17.8	 They were accompanied by the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah, and by the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 
2CH.17.9	 They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the scroll of the law of the 
2CH.17.10	 The 
2CH.17.11	 Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat tribute, including a load of silver. The Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks. 
2CH.17.12	 Jehoshaphat’s power kept increasing. He built fortresses and storage cities throughout Judah. 
2CH.17.13	 He had many supplies stored in the cities of Judah and an army of skilled warriors stationed in Jerusalem.
2CH.17.14	 These were their divisions by families: 
2CH.17.14	There were a thousand officers from Judah.
2CH.17.15	 Jehochanan the commander led 280,000, 
2CH.17.16	 and Amasiah son of Zikri, who volunteered to serve the 
2CH.17.17	 From Benjamin, Eliada, a skilled warrior, led 200,000 men who were equipped with bows and shields, 
2CH.17.18	 and Jehozabad led 180,000 trained warriors.
2CH.17.19	 These were the ones who served the king, besides those whom the king placed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
2CH.18.1	 Jehoshaphat was very wealthy and greatly respected. He made an alliance by marriage with Ahab, 
2CH.18.2	 and after several years
2CH.18.3	 King Ahab of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to attack Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I will support you; my army is at your disposal and will support you in battle.”
2CH.18.4	 Then Jehoshaphat added,
2CH.18.5	 So the king of Israel assembled 400 prophets and asked them, “Should we attack Ramoth Gilead or not?”
2CH.18.6	 But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not a prophet of the 
2CH.18.7	 The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man through whom we can seek the 
2CH.18.8	 The king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah.”
2CH.18.9	 Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their respective thrones, dressed in their royal robes, at the threshing floor at
2CH.18.10	 Zedekiah son of Kenaanah made iron horns and said, “This is what the 
2CH.18.11	 All the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Attack Ramoth Gilead! You will succeed; the 
2CH.18.12	 Now the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the prophets are in complete agreement that the king will succeed.
2CH.18.13	 But Micaiah said, “As certainly as the 
2CH.18.14	 Micaiah
2CH.18.15	 The king said to him, “How many times must I make you solemnly promise in
2CH.18.16	 Micaiah
2CH.18.17	 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster?” 
2CH.18.18	 Micaiah
2CH.18.19	 The 
2CH.18.20	 Then a spirit
2CH.18.21	 He replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ The 
2CH.18.22	 So now, look, the 
2CH.18.23	 Zedekiah son of Kenaanah approached, hit Micaiah on the jaw, and said, “Which way did the 
2CH.18.24	 Micaiah replied, “Look, you will see in the day when you go into an inner room to hide.” 
2CH.18.25	 Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the city official and Joash the king’s son. 
2CH.18.26	 Say, ‘This is what the king says: “Put this man in prison. Give him only a little bread and water
2CH.18.27	 Micaiah said, “If you really do return safely, then the 
2CH.18.28	 The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah attacked Ramoth Gilead. 
2CH.18.29	 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and then enter
2CH.18.30	 Now the king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders, “Do not fight common soldiers or high ranking officers;
2CH.18.31	 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “He must be the king of Israel!” So they turned and attacked him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. The 
2CH.18.32	 When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him. 
2CH.18.33	 Now an archer shot an arrow at random
2CH.18.34	 While the battle raged throughout the day, the king stood propped up in his chariot opposite the Syrians. He died in the evening as the sun was setting.
2CH.19.1	 When King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned home safely to Jerusalem,
2CH.19.2	 the prophet
2CH.19.3	 Nevertheless you have done some good things;
2CH.19.4	 Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem.
2CH.19.5	 He appointed judges throughout the land and in each of the fortified cities of Judah.
2CH.19.6	 He told the judges, “Be careful what you do,
2CH.19.7	 Respect the 
2CH.19.8	 In Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed some Levites, priests, and Israelite family leaders to judge on behalf of the 
2CH.19.9	 He commanded them: “Carry out your duties with respect for the 
2CH.19.10	 Whenever your countrymen who live in the cities bring a case before you
2CH.19.11	 You will report to Amariah the chief priest in all matters pertaining to the 
2CH.20.1	 Later the Moabites and Ammonites, along with some of the Meunites,
2CH.20.2	 Messengers
2CH.20.3	 Jehoshaphat was afraid, so he decided to seek the 
2CH.20.4	 The people of Judah
2CH.20.5	 Jehoshaphat stood before the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem
2CH.20.6	 He prayed: “O 
2CH.20.7	 Our God, you drove out
2CH.20.8	 They settled down in it and built in it a temple
2CH.20.9	 ‘If disaster comes on us in the form of military attack,
2CH.20.10	 Now the Ammonites, Moabites, and men from Mount Seir are coming!
2CH.20.11	 Look how they are repaying us! They come to drive us out of our allotted land which you assigned to us! 
2CH.20.12	 Our God, will you not judge them? For we are powerless against this huge army that attacks us! We don’t know what we should do; we look to you for help.”
2CH.20.13	 All the men of Judah
2CH.20.14	 Then in the midst of the assembly, the 
2CH.20.15	 He said: “Pay attention, all you people of Judah,
2CH.20.16	 Tomorrow march down against them as
2CH.20.17	 You will not fight in this battle. Take your positions, stand, and watch the 
2CH.20.18	 Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face toward the ground, and all the people of Judah
2CH.20.19	 Then some Levites, from the Kohathites and Korahites, got up and loudly praised the 
2CH.20.20	 Early the next morning they marched out to the Desert of Tekoa. When they were ready to march, Jehoshaphat stood up and said: “Listen to me, you people of Judah
2CH.20.21	 He met
2CH.20.22	 When they began to shout and praise, the 
2CH.20.23	 The Ammonites and Moabites attacked the men from Mount Seir
2CH.20.24	 When the men of Judah
2CH.20.25	 Jehoshaphat and his men
2CH.20.26	 On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, where
2CH.20.27	 Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat leading them; the 
2CH.20.28	 They entered Jerusalem to the sound of stringed instruments and trumpets and proceeded to the temple of the 
2CH.20.29	 All the kingdoms of the surrounding lands were afraid of God
2CH.20.30	 Jehoshaphat’s kingdom enjoyed peace; his God made him secure on every side.
2CH.20.31	 Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem.
2CH.20.32	 He followed in his father Asa’s footsteps and was careful to do what the 
2CH.20.33	 However, the high places were not eliminated; the people were still not devoted to the God of their ancestors.
2CH.20.34	 The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Annals of Jehu son of Hanani which are included in Scroll of the Kings of Israel.
2CH.20.35	 Later King Jehoshaphat of Judah made an alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, who
2CH.20.36	 They agreed
2CH.20.37	 Eliezer son of Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, “Because
2CH.21.1	 Jehoshaphat passed away
2CH.21.2	 His brothers, Jehoshaphat’s sons, were Azariah, Jechiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. All of these were sons of King Jehoshaphat of Israel.
2CH.21.3	 Their father gave them many presents, including silver, gold, and other precious items, along with fortified cities in Judah. But he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn.
2CH.21.4	 Jehoram took control of his father’s kingdom and became powerful.
2CH.21.5	 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
2CH.21.6	 He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel, just as Ahab’s dynasty had done, for he married Ahab’s daughter.
2CH.21.7	 But the 
2CH.21.8	 During Jehoram’s
2CH.21.9	 Jehoram crossed over to Zair with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites, who had surrounded him, attacked at night and defeated him and his chariot officers.
2CH.21.10	 So Edom has remained free from Judah’s control to this very day.
2CH.21.11	 He also built high places on the hills of Judah; he encouraged the residents of Jerusalem to be unfaithful to the 
2CH.21.12	 Jehoram
2CH.21.13	 but have instead followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel. You encouraged the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem to be unfaithful to the 
2CH.21.14	 So look, the 
2CH.21.15	 And you will get a serious, chronic intestinal disease which will cause your intestines to come out.”
2CH.21.16	 The 
2CH.21.17	 They attacked Judah and swept through it.
2CH.21.18	 After all this happened, the 
2CH.21.19	 After about two years his intestines came out because of the disease, so that he died a very painful death.
2CH.21.20	 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. No one regretted his death;
2CH.22.1	 The residents of Jerusalem
2CH.22.2	 Ahaziah was twenty-two
2CH.22.3	 He followed in the footsteps of Ahab’s dynasty,
2CH.22.4	 He did evil in the sight of
2CH.22.5	 He followed their advice and joined Ahab’s son King Joram
2CH.22.6	 Joram
2CH.22.7	 God brought about Ahaziah’s downfall through his visit to Joram.
2CH.22.8	 While Jehu was dishing out punishment to Ahab’s family, he discovered the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s relatives who were serving Ahaziah and killed them. 
2CH.22.9	 He looked for Ahaziah, who was captured while hiding in Samaria.
2CH.22.10	 When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she was determined to destroy the entire royal line
2CH.22.11	 So Jehoshabeath,
2CH.22.12	 He remained in hiding in God’s temple
2CH.23.1	 In the seventh year Jehoiada made a bold move. He made a pact
2CH.23.2	 They traveled throughout Judah and assembled the Levites from all the cities of Judah, as well as the Israelite family leaders.
2CH.23.2	They came to Jerusalem,
2CH.23.3	 and the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in the temple of God. Jehoiada
2CH.23.4	 This is what you must do. One third of you priests and Levites who are on duty during the Sabbath will guard the doors. 
2CH.23.5	 Another third of you will be stationed at the royal palace and still another third at the Foundation Gate. All the others
2CH.23.6	 No one must enter the 
2CH.23.7	 The Levites must surround the king. Each of you must hold his weapon in his hand. Whoever tries to enter the temple
2CH.23.8	 The Levites and all the men of Judah
2CH.23.9	 Jehoiada the priest gave to the officers of the units of hundreds King David’s spears and shields
2CH.23.10	 He placed the men at their posts, each holding his weapon in his hand. They lined up from the south side of the temple to the north side and stood near the altar and the temple, surrounding the king.
2CH.23.11	 Jehoiada and his sons led out the king’s son and placed on him the crown and the royal insignia.
2CH.23.12	 When Athaliah heard the royal guard
2CH.23.13	 Then she saw
2CH.23.14	 Jehoiada the priest sent out the officers of the units of hundreds, who were in charge of the army, and ordered them, “Bring her outside the temple to the guards.
2CH.23.15	 They seized her and took her into the precincts of the royal palace through the horses’ entrance.
2CH.23.16	 Jehoiada then drew up a covenant stipulating that he, all the people, and the king should be loyal to the 
2CH.23.17	 All the people went and demolished
2CH.23.18	 Jehoiada then assigned the duties of the 
2CH.23.19	 He posted guards at the gates of the 
2CH.23.20	 He summoned
2CH.23.21	 All the people of the land celebrated, for the city had rest now that they had killed Athaliah.
2CH.24.1	 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem.
2CH.24.2	 Joash did what the 
2CH.24.3	 Jehoiada chose two wives for him who gave him sons and daughters. 
2CH.24.4	 Joash was determined to repair the 
2CH.24.5	 He assembled the priests and Levites and ordered them, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect the annual quota of silver from all Israel for repairs on the temple of your God. Be quick about it!” But the Levites delayed. 
2CH.24.6	 So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest,
2CH.24.7	 (Wicked Athaliah and her sons had broken into God’s temple and used all the holy items of the 
2CH.24.8	 The king ordered a chest to be made and placed outside the gate of the 
2CH.24.9	 An edict was sent throughout Judah and Jerusalem requiring the people to bring to the 
2CH.24.10	 All the officials and all the people gladly brought their silver and threw it into the chest until it was full. 
2CH.24.11	 Whenever the Levites brought the chest to the royal accountant and they saw there was a lot of silver, the royal scribe and the accountant of the high priest emptied the chest and then took it back to its place. They went through this routine every day and collected a large amount of silver. 
2CH.24.12	 The king and Jehoiada gave it to the construction foremen
2CH.24.13	 They worked hard and made the repairs.
2CH.24.14	 When they were finished, they brought the rest of the silver to the king and Jehoiada. They used it to make items for the 
2CH.24.15	 Jehoiada grew old and died at the age of 130.
2CH.24.16	 He was buried in the City of David
2CH.24.17	 After Jehoiada died, the officials of Judah visited the king and declared their loyalty to him.

2CH.29.22	 They slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and splashed it on the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and splashed the blood on the altar; next they slaughtered the lambs and splashed the blood on the altar. 
2CH.29.23	 Finally they brought the goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they placed their hands on them. 
2CH.29.24	 Then the priests slaughtered them. They offered their blood as a sin offering on the altar to make atonement for all Israel, because the king had decreed

2CH.30.8	 Now, don’t be stubborn
2CH.30.9	 For if you return to the 
2CH.30.10	 The messengers journeyed from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun, but people mocked and ridiculed them.
2CH.30.11	 But some men from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	 In Judah God moved the people to unite and carry out the edict the king and the officers had issued at the 
2CH.30.13	 A huge crowd assembled in Jerusalem to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.
2CH.30.14	 They removed the altars in Jerusalem; they also removed all the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
2CH.30.15	 They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed, so they consecrated themselves and brought burnt sacrifices to the 
2CH.30.16	 They stood at their posts according to the regulations outlined in the law of Moses, the man of God. The priests were splashing the blood as the Levites handed it to them.
2CH.30.17	 Because many in the assembly had not consecrated themselves, the Levites slaughtered
2CH.30.18	 The majority of the many people from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun were ceremonially unclean, yet they ate the Passover in violation of what is prescribed in the law.
2CH.30.19	 everyone who has determined to follow God,
2CH.30.20	 The 
2CH.30.21	 The Israelites who were in Jerusalem observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. The Levites and priests were praising the 
2CH.30.22	 Hezekiah expressed his appreciation to all the Levites,
2CH.30.23	 The entire assembly then decided to celebrate for seven more days; so they joyfully celebrated for seven more days. 
2CH.30.24	 King Hezekiah of Judah supplied 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep
2CH.30.25	 The celebration included
2CH.30.26	 There was a great celebration in Jerusalem, unlike anything that had occurred in Jerusalem since the time of King Solomon son of David of Israel.
2CH.30.27	 The priests and Levites got up and pronounced blessings on the people. The 
2CH.31.1	 When all this was over, the Israelites
2CH.31.2	 Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and Levites to do their assigned tasks
2CH.31.3	 The king contributed

2CH.31.5	 When the edict was issued,
2CH.31.6	 The Israelites and people of Judah
2CH.31.7	 In the third month they began piling their contributions in heaps
2CH.31.8	 When Hezekiah and the officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the 
2CH.31.9	 When Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps, 
2CH.31.10	 Azariah, the head priest from the family of Zadok, said to him, “Since the contributions began arriving in the

2CH.31.18	 and to all the infants, wives, sons, and daughters of the entire assembly listed in the genealogical records, for they faithfully consecrated themselves. 
2CH.31.19	 As for the descendants of Aaron, the priests who lived in the outskirts of all their cities,
2CH.31.20	 This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He did what the 
2CH.31.21	 He wholeheartedly and successfully reinstituted service in God’s temple and obedience to the law, in order to follow his God.
2CH.32.1	 After these faithful deeds were accomplished, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah. He besieged the fortified cities, intending to seize them.
2CH.32.2	 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had invaded and intended to attack Jerusalem,
2CH.32.3	 he consulted with his advisers and military officers about stopping up the springs
2CH.32.4	 A large number of people gathered together and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the district.
2CH.32.5	 Hezekiah
2CH.32.6	 He appointed military officers over the army
2CH.32.7	 “Be strong and brave! Don’t be afraid and don’t panic
2CH.32.8	 He has with him mere human strength,
2CH.32.9	 Afterward King Sennacherib of Assyria, while attacking Lachish with all his military might, sent his messengers
2CH.32.10	 “This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says: ‘Why are you so confident that you remain in Jerusalem while it is under siege?
2CH.32.11	 Hezekiah says, “The 
2CH.32.12	 Hezekiah is the one who eliminated
2CH.32.13	 Are you not aware of what I and my predecessors
2CH.32.14	 Who among all the gods of these nations whom my predecessors annihilated was able to rescue his people from my power?
2CH.32.15	 Now don’t let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this. Don’t believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to rescue his people from my power or the power of my predecessors. So how
2CH.32.16	 Sennacherib’s
2CH.32.17	 He wrote letters mocking the

2CH.32.19	 They talked about the God of Jerusalem as if he were one of the man-made gods of the nations of the earth.
2CH.32.20	 King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed about this and cried out to heaven. 
2CH.32.21	 The 
2CH.32.22	 The 
2CH.32.23	 Many were bringing presents
2CH.32.24	 In those days Hezekiah was stricken with a terminal illness.
2CH.32.25	 But Hezekiah was ungrateful; he had a proud attitude, provoking God to be angry at him, as well as Judah and Jerusalem.
2CH.32.26	 But then Hezekiah and the residents of Jerusalem humbled themselves and abandoned their pride, and the 
2CH.32.27	 Hezekiah was very wealthy and greatly respected. He made storehouses for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices, and all his other valuable possessions.
2CH.32.28	 He made storerooms for the harvest of grain, wine, and olive oil, and stalls for all his various kinds of livestock and his flocks.
2CH.32.29	 He built royal cities
2CH.32.30	 Hezekiah dammed up the source of the waters of the Upper Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the City of David.
2CH.32.31	 So when the envoys arrived from the Babylonian officials to visit him and inquire about the sign that occurred in the land,
2CH.32.32	 The rest of the events of Hezekiah’s reign, including his faithful deeds, are recorded in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz, included in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

2CH.35.8	 His officials also willingly contributed to the people, priests, and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the leaders of God’s temple, supplied 2,600 Passover sacrifices and 300 cattle. 
2CH.35.9	 Konaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, along with Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the officials of the Levites, supplied the Levites with 5,000 Passover sacrifices and 500 cattle. 
2CH.35.10	 Preparations were made,
2CH.35.11	 They slaughtered the Passover lambs and the priests splashed the blood,
2CH.35.12	 They reserved the burnt offerings and the cattle for the family divisions of the people to present to the 
2CH.35.13	 They cooked the Passover sacrifices over the open fire as prescribed and cooked the consecrated offerings in pots, kettles, and pans. They quickly served them to all the people. 
2CH.35.14	 Afterward they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were offering burnt sacrifices and fat portions until evening. The Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron. 
2CH.35.15	 The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, manned their posts, as prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s prophet.
2CH.35.16	 So all the preparations for the 
2CH.35.17	 So the Israelites who were present observed the Passover at that time, as well as the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days. 
2CH.35.18	 A Passover like this had not been observed in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel had observed a Passover like the one celebrated by Josiah, the priests, the Levites, all the people of Judah and Israel who were there, and the residents of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	 This Passover was observed in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign.
2CH.35.20	 After Josiah had done all this for the temple,
2CH.35.21	 Necho
2CH.35.22	 But Josiah did not turn back from him;
2CH.35.23	 Archers shot King Josiah; the king ordered his servants, “Take me out of this chariot,
2CH.35.24	 So his servants took him out of the chariot, put him in another chariot that he owned, and brought him to Jerusalem,
2CH.35.25	 Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah which all the male and female singers use to mourn Josiah to this very day. It has become customary in Israel to sing these; they are recorded in the Book of Laments.
2CH.35.26	 The rest of the events of Josiah’s reign, including the faithful acts he did in obedience to what is written in the law of the 
2CH.35.27	 and his accomplishments, from start to finish, are recorded
2CH.36.1	 The people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in his father’s place in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.2	 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.3	 The king of Egypt prevented him from ruling in Jerusalem and imposed on the land a special tax
2CH.36.4	 The king of Egypt made Jehoahaz’s
2CH.36.5	 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.6	 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked him,
2CH.36.7	 Nebuchadnezzar took some of the items in the 
2CH.36.8	 The rest of the events of Jehoiakim’s reign, including the horrible sins he committed and his shortcomings, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.9	 Jehoiachin was eighteen
2CH.36.10	 At the beginning of the year King Nebuchadnezzar ordered him to be brought
2CH.36.11	 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.12	 He did evil in the sight of
2CH.36.13	 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him vow allegiance
2CH.36.14	 All the leaders of the priests and people became more unfaithful and committed the same horrible sins practiced by the nations.
2CH.36.15	 The 
2CH.36.16	 But they mocked God’s messengers, despised his warnings,
2CH.36.17	 He brought against them the king of the Babylonians, who slaughtered
2CH.36.18	 He carried away to Babylon all the items in God’s temple, whether large or small, as well as what was in the treasuries of the 
2CH.36.19	 They burned down the 
2CH.36.20	 He deported to Babylon all who escaped the sword. They served him and his sons until the Persian kingdom rose to power. 
2CH.36.21	 This took place to fulfill the

EZR.3.3	 They established the altar on its foundations, even though they were in terror of the local peoples,
EZR.3.4	 They observed the Festival of Temporary Shelters

EZR.3.8	 In the second year after they had come to the temple of God in Jerusalem,

EZR.3.11	All the people gave a loud
EZR.3.12	 Many of the priests, the Levites, and the leaders
EZR.3.13	 People were unable to tell the difference between the sound of joyous shouting and the sound of the people’s weeping, for the people were shouting so loudly
EZR.4.1	 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin learned that the former exiles
EZR.4.2	 they came to Zerubbabel and the leaders
EZR.4.3	 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the leaders of Israel said to them, “You have no right
EZR.4.4	 Then the local people
EZR.4.5	 They were hiring advisers to oppose them, so as to frustrate their plans, throughout the time
EZR.4.6	 At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus
EZR.4.7	 And during the reign

EZR.4.8	 Rehum the commander
EZR.4.9	 From
EZR.4.10	 and the rest of nations whom the great and noble Ashurbanipal
EZR.4.11	 (This is a copy of the letter they sent to him:)
EZR.4.11	“To King Artaxerxes,
EZR.4.12	 Now
EZR.4.13	 Let the king also be aware that if this city is built and its walls are completed, no more tax, custom, or toll will be paid, and the royal treasury
EZR.4.14	 In light of the fact that we are loyal to the king,
EZR.4.15	 so that he may initiate a search of the records
EZR.4.16	 We therefore are informing the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, you will not retain control
EZR.4.17	 The king sent the following response:
EZR.4.17	“To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues who live in Samaria and other parts of Trans-Euphrates: Greetings!
EZR.4.18	 The letter you sent to us has been translated and read in my presence. 
EZR.4.19	 So I gave orders,
EZR.4.20	 Powerful kings have been over Jerusalem who ruled throughout the entire Trans-Euphrates
EZR.4.21	 Now give orders that these men cease their work and that this city not be rebuilt until such time as I so instruct.
EZR.4.22	 Exercise appropriate caution so that there is no negligence in this matter. Why should danger increase to the point that kings sustain damage?”
EZR.4.23	 Then, as soon as the copy of the letter from King Artaxerxes was read in the presence of Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their colleagues, they proceeded promptly to the Jews in Jerusalem
EZR.4.24	 So the work on the temple of God in Jerusalem came to a halt. It remained halted until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.
EZR.5.1	 Then the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son
EZR.5.2	 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak began
EZR.5.3	 At that time Tattenai governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and their colleagues came to them and asked, “Who gave you authority
EZR.5.4	 They
EZR.5.5	 But God was watching over
EZR.5.6	 This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and his colleagues who were the officials of Trans-Euphrates sent to King Darius. 
EZR.5.7	 The report they sent to him was written as follows:
EZR.5.7	“To King Darius: All greetings!
EZR.5.8	 Let it be known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the temple of the great God. It is being built with large stones,
EZR.5.9	 We inquired of those elders, asking them, ‘Who gave you the authority to rebuild this temple and to complete this structure?’ 
EZR.5.10	 We also inquired of their names in order to inform you, so that we might write the names of the men who were their leaders. 
EZR.5.11	 They responded to us in the following way: ‘We are servants of the God of heaven and earth. We are rebuilding the temple which was previously built many years ago. A great king
EZR.5.12	 But after our ancestors
EZR.5.13	 But in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon,
EZR.5.14	 Even the gold and silver vessels of the temple of God that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and had brought to the palace
EZR.5.15	 He said to him, “Take these vessels and go deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt in its proper location.”
EZR.5.16	 Then this Sheshbazzar went and laid the foundations of the temple of God in Jerusalem. From that time to the present moment
EZR.5.17	 “Now if the king is so inclined,
EZR.6.1	 So Darius the king issued orders, and they searched in the archives
EZR.6.2	 A scroll was found in the citadel
EZR.6.2	“Memorandum: 
EZR.6.3	 In the first year of his reign,
EZR.6.4	 with three layers of large stones
EZR.6.5	 Furthermore let the gold and silver vessels of the temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar brought from the temple in Jerusalem and carried to Babylon, be returned and brought to their proper place in the temple in Jerusalem. Let them be deposited in the temple of God.’ 
EZR.6.6	 “Now Tattenai governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar Bozenai, and their colleagues, the officials of Trans-Euphrates – all of you stay far away from there! 
EZR.6.7	 Leave the work on this temple of God alone.
EZR.6.8	 “I also hereby issue orders as to what you are to do with those elders of the Jews in order to rebuild this temple of God. From the royal treasury, from the taxes of Trans-Euphrates the complete costs are to be given to these men, so that there may be no interruption of the work.
EZR.6.9	 Whatever is needed – whether oxen or rams or lambs or burnt offerings for the God of heaven or wheat or salt or wine or oil, as required by
EZR.6.10	 so that they may be offering incense to the God of heaven and may be praying for the good fortune of the king and his family.
EZR.6.11	 “I hereby give orders that if anyone changes this directive a beam is to be pulled out from his house and he is to be raised up and impaled
EZR.6.12	 May God who makes his name to reside there overthrow any king or nation
EZR.6.13	 Then Tattenai governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and their colleagues acted accordingly – with precision, just as Darius the king had given instructions.
EZR.6.14	 The elders of the Jews continued building and prospering, while at the same time
EZR.6.15	 They finished this temple on the third day of the month Adar, which is the sixth
EZR.6.16	 The people
EZR.6.17	 For the dedication of this temple of God they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve male goats for the sin of all Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	 They appointed the priests by their divisions and the Levites by their divisions over the worship of God at Jerusalem,
EZR.6.19	 The exiles
EZR.6.20	 The priests and the Levites had purified themselves, every last one,
EZR.6.21	 The Israelites who were returning from the exile ate it, along with all those who had joined them
EZR.6.22	 They observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, for the 
EZR.7.1	 Now after these things had happened, during the reign of King Artaxerxes
EZR.7.2	 who was the son of Shallum, who was the son of Zadok, who was the son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	 who was the son of Amariah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	 who was the son of Zerahiah, who was the son of Uzzi, who was the son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	 who was the son of Abishua, who was the son of Phinehas, who was the son of Eleazar, who was the son of Aaron the chief priest. 
EZR.7.6	 This Ezra is the one who came up from Babylon. He was a scribe who was skilled in the law of Moses which the 
EZR.7.7	 In the seventh year of King Artaxerxes, Ezra brought
EZR.7.8	 He entered Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king. 
EZR.7.9	 On the first day of the first month he had determined to make
EZR.7.10	 Now Ezra had dedicated himself
EZR.7.11	 What follows
EZR.7.12	 “Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, a scribe of the perfect law of the God of heaven: 
EZR.7.13	 I have now issued a decree
EZR.7.14	 You are authorized
EZR.7.15	 and to bring silver and gold which the king and his advisers have freely contributed to the God of Israel, who resides in Jerusalem, 
EZR.7.16	 along with all the silver and gold that you may collect
EZR.7.17	 With this money you should be sure to purchase bulls, rams, and lambs, along with the appropriate
EZR.7.18	 You may do whatever seems appropriate to you and your colleagues
EZR.7.19	 Deliver to
EZR.7.20	 The rest of the needs for the temple of your God that you may have to supply,
EZR.7.21	 “I, King Artaxerxes, hereby issue orders to all the treasurers of
EZR.7.22	 up to 100 talents of silver, 100 cors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of olive oil,
EZR.7.23	 Everything that the God of heaven has required should be precisely done for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should there be wrath
EZR.7.24	 Furthermore, be aware of the fact
EZR.7.25	 “Now you, Ezra, in keeping with the wisdom of your God which you possess,
EZR.7.26	 Everyone who does not observe both the law of your God and the law of the king will be completely
EZR.7.27	 Blessed be the 
EZR.7.28	 He has also conferred his favor on me before the king, his advisers, and all the influential leaders of the king. I gained strength as the hand of the 
EZR.8.1	 These are the leaders
EZR.8.2	 from the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom; 
EZR.8.2	from the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; 
EZR.8.2	from the descendants of David, Hattush 
EZR.8.3	 the son of Shecaniah;
EZR.8.3	from the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were enrolled by genealogy 150 men; 
EZR.8.4	 from the descendants of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men; 
EZR.8.5	 from the descendants of Zattu,
EZR.8.6	 from the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men; 
EZR.8.7	 from the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men; 
EZR.8.8	 from the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him 80 men; 
EZR.8.9	 from the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men; 
EZR.8.10	 from the descendants of Bani,
EZR.8.11	 from the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28 men; 
EZR.8.12	 from the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men; 
EZR.8.13	 from the descendants of Adonikam there were the latter ones.
EZR.8.14	 from the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai, and Zaccur,
EZR.8.15	 I had them assemble
EZR.8.16	 So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan,
EZR.8.17	 I sent them to Iddo, who was the leader in the place called Casiphia. I told them
EZR.8.18	 Due to the fact that the good hand of our God was on us, they brought us a skilled man, from the descendants of Mahli the son of Levi son of Israel. This man was Sherebiah,
EZR.8.19	 and Hashabiah, along with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men, 
EZR.8.20	 and some of the temple servants that David and his officials had established for the work of the Levites – 220 of them. They were all designated by name.
EZR.8.21	 I called for a fast there by the Ahava Canal, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and seek from him a safe journey
EZR.8.22	 I was embarrassed to request soldiers and horsemen from the king to protect us from the enemy
EZR.8.23	 So we fasted and prayed to our God about this, and he answered us. 
EZR.8.24	 Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with
EZR.8.25	 and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the vessels intended for the temple of our God – items that the king, his advisers, his officials, and all Israel who were present had contributed. 
EZR.8.26	 I weighed out to them
EZR.8.27	 20 gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and two exquisite vessels of gleaming bronze, as valuable as gold. 
EZR.8.28	 Then I said to them, “You are holy to the 
EZR.8.29	 Be careful with them and protect them, until you weigh them out before the leading priests and the Levites and the family leaders of Israel in Jerusalem,
EZR.8.30	 Then the priests and the Levites took charge of
EZR.8.31	 On the twelfth day of the first month we began traveling from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from our enemy and from bandits
EZR.8.32	 So we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there for three days. 
EZR.8.33	 On the fourth day we weighed out the silver, the gold, and the vessels in the house of our God into the care
EZR.8.34	 Everything was verified
EZR.8.35	 The exiles who were returning from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel – twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs, along with twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the 
EZR.8.36	 Then they presented the decrees of the king to the king’s satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who gave help to the people and to the temple of God.
EZR.9.1	 Now when these things had been completed, the leaders approached me and said, “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the local residents
EZR.9.2	 Indeed, they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race
EZR.9.3	 When I heard this report, I tore my tunic and my robe and ripped out some of the hair from my head and beard. Then I sat down, quite devastated. 
EZR.9.4	 Everyone who held the words of the God of Israel in awe
EZR.9.5	 At the time of the evening offering I got up from my self-abasement,
EZR.9.6	 I prayed,
EZR.9.6	“O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face to you, my God! For our iniquities have climbed higher than our heads, and our guilt extends to the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	 From the days of our fathers until this very day our guilt has been great. Because of our iniquities we, along with our kings and
EZR.9.8	 “But now briefly
EZR.9.9	 Although we are slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our servitude. He has extended kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, in that he has revived us
EZR.9.10	 “And now what are we able to say after this, our God? For we have forsaken your commandments 
EZR.9.11	 which you commanded us through your servants the prophets with these words:
EZR.9.12	 Therefore do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons, and do not take their daughters in marriage for your sons. Do not ever seek their peace or welfare, so that you may be strong and may eat the good of the land and may leave it as an inheritance for your children
EZR.9.13	 “Everything that has happened to us has come about because of our wicked actions and our great guilt. Even so, our God, you have exercised restraint
EZR.9.14	 Shall we once again break your commandments and intermarry with these abominable peoples? Would you not be so angered by us that you would wipe us out, with no survivor or remnant? 
EZR.9.15	 O 
EZR.10.1	 While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself to the ground before the temple of God, a very large crowd of Israelites – men, women, and children alike – gathered around him. The people wept loudly.
EZR.10.2	 Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, from the descendants of Elam,
EZR.10.2	“We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying
EZR.10.3	 Therefore let us enact
EZR.10.4	 Get up, for this matter concerns you. We are with you, so be strong and act decisively!”
EZR.10.5	 So Ezra got up and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take an oath to carry out this plan.
EZR.10.6	 Then Ezra got up from in front of the temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he stayed
EZR.10.7	 A proclamation
EZR.10.8	 Everyone who did not come within three days would thereby forfeit all his property, in keeping with the counsel of the officials and the elders. Furthermore, he himself would be excluded from the assembly of the exiles.
EZR.10.9	 All the men of Judah and Benjamin were gathered in Jerusalem within the three days. (It was in the ninth month, on the twentieth day of that month.) All the people sat in the square at the temple of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the rains.
EZR.10.10	 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have behaved in an unfaithful manner by taking foreign wives! This has contributed to the guilt of Israel. 
EZR.10.11	 Now give praise to the 
EZR.10.12	 All the assembly replied in a loud voice: “We will do just as you have said!
EZR.10.13	 However, the people are numerous and it is the rainy season.
EZR.10.14	 Let our leaders take steps
EZR.10.15	 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah were
EZR.10.16	 So the exiles proceeded accordingly. Ezra the priest separated out
EZR.10.17	 and on the first day of the first month they finished considering all the men who had married foreign wives. 
EZR.10.18	 It was determined

EZR.10.44	 All these had taken foreign wives, and some of them also had children by these women.
NEH.1.1	 These are the words of Nehemiah
NEH.1.1	It so happened that in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year,
NEH.1.2	 Hanani, who was one of my relatives,
NEH.1.3	 They said to me, “The remnant that remains from the exile there in the province are experiencing considerable
NEH.1.4	 When I heard these things I sat down abruptly,
NEH.1.5	 Then I said, “Please, O 
NEH.1.6	 may your ear be attentive and your eyes be open to hear the prayer of your servant that I am praying to you today throughout both day and night on behalf of your servants the Israelites. I am confessing the sins of the Israelites that we have committed
NEH.1.7	 We have behaved corruptly against you, not obeying the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments that you commanded your servant Moses. 
NEH.1.8	 Please recall the word you commanded your servant Moses: ‘If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the nations.
NEH.1.9	 But if you repent
NEH.1.10	 They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your mighty strength and by your powerful hand. 
NEH.1.11	 Please,
NEH.1.11	Now
NEH.2.1	 Then in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought to me,
NEH.2.2	 So the king said to me, “Why do you appear to be depressed when you aren’t sick? What can this be other than sadness of heart?” This made me very fearful. 
NEH.2.3	 I replied to the king, “O king, live forever! Why would I not appear dejected when the city with the graves of my ancestors
NEH.2.4	 The king responded,
NEH.2.5	 and said to the king, “If the king is so inclined
NEH.2.6	 Then the king, with his consort
NEH.2.7	 I said to the king, “If the king is so inclined, let him give me letters for the governors of Trans-Euphrates
NEH.2.8	 and a letter for Asaph the keeper of the king’s nature preserve,
NEH.2.9	 Then I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, and I presented to them the letters from the king. The king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen. 
NEH.2.10	 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official
NEH.2.11	 So I came to Jerusalem.
NEH.2.12	 I got up during the night, along with a few men who were with me. But I did not tell anyone what my God was putting on my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me, except for the one
NEH.2.13	 I proceeded through the Valley Gate by night, in the direction of the Well of the Dragons
NEH.2.14	 I passed on to the Gate of the Well and the King’s Pool, where there was not enough room for my animal to pass with me. 
NEH.2.15	 I continued up the valley during the night, inspecting the wall. Then I turned back and came to the Valley Gate, and so returned. 
NEH.2.16	 The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had been doing, for up to this point I had not told any of the Jews or the priests or the nobles or the officials or the rest of the workers. 
NEH.2.17	 Then I said to them, “You see the problem that we have: Jerusalem is desolate and its gates are burned. Come on! Let’s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that this reproach will not continue.” 
NEH.2.18	 Then I related to them how the good hand of my God was on me and what
NEH.2.19	 But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard all this,
NEH.2.20	 I responded to them by saying, “The God of heaven will prosper us. We his servants will start the rebuilding.
NEH.3.1	 Then Eliashib the high priest and his priestly colleagues
NEH.3.2	 The men of Jericho
NEH.3.3	 The sons of Hassenaah rebuilt the Fish Gate. They laid its beams and positioned its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.4	 Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakoz, worked on the section adjacent to them. Meshullam son of Berechiah the son of Meshezabel worked on the section next to them. And Zadok son of Baana worked on the section adjacent to them.

NEH.3.7	 Adjacent to them worked Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, who were men of Gibeon and Mizpah. These towns were under the jurisdiction

NEH.3.11	 Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab worked on another section and the Tower of the Fire Pots. 
NEH.3.12	 Shallum son of Hallohesh, head of a half-district of Jerusalem, worked on the section adjacent to him, assisted by his daughters.
NEH.3.13	 Hanun and the residents of Zanoah worked on the Valley Gate. They rebuilt it and positioned its doors, its bolts, and its bars, in addition to working on fifteen hundred feet
NEH.3.14	 Malkijah son of Recab, head of the district of Beth Hakkerem, worked on the Dung Gate. He rebuilt it and positioned its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.15	 Shallun son of Col-Hozeh, head of the district of Mizpah, worked on the Fountain Gate. He rebuilt it, put on its roof, and positioned its doors, its bolts, and its bars. In addition, he rebuilt the wall of the Pool of Siloam,
NEH.3.16	 Nehemiah son of Azbuk, head of a half-district of Beth Zur, worked after him as far as the tombs of David and the artificial pool and the House of the Warriors. 
NEH.3.17	 After him the Levites worked – Rehum son of Bani and
NEH.3.18	 After him their relatives
NEH.3.19	 Adjacent to him Ezer son of Jeshua, head of Mizpah, worked on another section, opposite the ascent to the armory at the buttress. 
NEH.3.20	 After him Baruch son of Zabbai worked on another section, from the buttress to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 
NEH.3.21	 After him Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, worked on another section from the door of Eliashib’s house to the end of it.
NEH.3.22	 After him the priests worked, men of the nearby district. 
NEH.3.23	 After them Benjamin and Hasshub worked opposite their house. After them Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, worked near his house. 
NEH.3.24	 After him Binnui son of Henadad worked on another section, from the house of Azariah to the buttress and the corner. 
NEH.3.25	 After him Palal son of Uzai worked
NEH.3.26	 and the temple servants who were living on Ophel worked
NEH.3.27	 After them the men of Tekoa worked on another section, from opposite the great protruding tower to the wall of Ophel. 
NEH.3.28	 Above the Horse Gate the priests worked, each in front of his house. 
NEH.3.29	 After them Zadok son of Immer worked opposite his house, and after him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, guard at the East Gate, worked. 
NEH.3.30	 After him
NEH.3.31	 After him Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, worked as far as the house of the temple servants and the traders, opposite the Inspection Gate,
NEH.3.32	 And between the room above the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and traders worked.
NEH.4.2	 and in the presence of his colleagues
NEH.4.3	 Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was close by, said, “If even a fox were to climb up on what they are building, it would break down their wall of stones!”
NEH.4.4	 Hear, O our God, for we are despised! Return their reproach on their own head! Reduce them to plunder in a land of exile! 
NEH.4.5	 Do not cover their iniquity, and do not wipe out their sin from before them. For they have bitterly offended
NEH.4.6	 So we rebuilt the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height.
NEH.4.8	 All of them conspired together to move with armed forces
NEH.4.9	 So we prayed to our God and stationed a guard to protect against them
NEH.4.10	 Then those in Judah said, “The strength of the laborers
NEH.4.11	 Our adversaries also boasted,
NEH.4.12	 So it happened that the Jews who were living near them came and warned us repeatedly
NEH.4.13	 So I stationed people at the lower places behind the wall in the exposed places.
NEH.4.14	 When I had made an inspection,
NEH.4.15	 It so happened that when our adversaries heard that we were aware of these matters,
NEH.4.16	 From that day forward, half of my men were doing the work and half of them were taking up spears,
NEH.4.17	 who were rebuilding the wall.
NEH.4.18	 The builders to a man had their swords strapped to their sides while they were building. But the trumpeter
NEH.4.19	 I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “The work is demanding
NEH.4.20	 Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, gather there with us. Our God will fight for us!” 
NEH.4.21	 So we worked on,
NEH.4.22	 At that time I instructed
NEH.4.23	 We did not change clothes
NEH.5.1	 Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews.
NEH.5.2	 There were those who said, “With our sons and daughters, we are many. We must obtain
NEH.5.3	 There were others who said, “We are putting up our fields, our vineyards, and our houses as collateral in order to obtain grain during the famine.” 
NEH.5.4	 Then there were those who said, “We have borrowed money to pay our taxes to the king
NEH.5.5	 And now, though we share the same flesh and blood as our fellow countrymen,
NEH.5.6	 I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints.
NEH.5.7	 I considered these things carefully
NEH.5.8	 I said to them, “To the extent possible we have bought back our fellow Jews
NEH.5.9	 Then I
NEH.5.10	 Even I and my relatives
NEH.5.11	 This very day return to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive trees, and their houses, along with the interest
NEH.5.12	 They replied, “We will return these things,
NEH.5.13	 I also shook out my garment,
NEH.5.14	 From the day that I was appointed
NEH.5.15	 But the former governors who preceded me had burdened the people and had taken food and wine from them, in addition to
NEH.5.16	 I gave myself to the work on this wall, without even purchasing
NEH.5.17	 There were 150 Jews and officials who dined with me routinely,
NEH.5.18	 Every day one ox, six select sheep, and some birds were prepared for me, and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance. Despite all this I did not require the food allotted to the governor, for the work was demanding on this people.
NEH.5.19	 Please remember me for good, O my God, for all that I have done for this people.
NEH.6.1	 When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and no breach remained in it (even though up to that time I had not positioned doors in the gates), 
NEH.6.2	 Sanballat and Geshem sent word to me saying, “Come on! Let’s set up a time to meet together at Kephirim
NEH.6.3	 So I sent messengers to them saying, “I am engaged in
NEH.6.4	 They contacted
NEH.6.5	 The fifth time that Sanballat sent his assistant to me in this way, he had an open letter in his hand. 
NEH.6.6	 Written in it were the following words: 
NEH.6.6	“Among the nations it is rumored
NEH.6.7	 You have also established prophets to announce
NEH.6.8	 I sent word back to him, “We are not engaged in these activities you are describing.
NEH.6.9	 All of them were wanting
NEH.6.9	So now, strengthen my hands!
NEH.6.10	 Then I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel. He was confined to his home.
NEH.6.11	 But I replied, “Should a man like me run away? Would someone like me flee to the temple in order to save his life?
NEH.6.12	 I recognized the fact that God had not sent him, for he had spoken the prophecy against me as a hired agent of Tobiah and Sanballat.
NEH.6.13	 He had been hired to scare me so that I would do this and thereby sin. They would thus bring reproach on me and I
NEH.6.14	 Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat in light of these actions of theirs – also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who were trying to scare me!
NEH.6.15	 So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in just fifty-two days. 
NEH.6.16	 When all our enemies heard and all the nations who were around us saw
NEH.6.17	 In those days the aristocrats of Judah repeatedly sent letters to Tobiah, and responses from Tobiah were repeatedly coming to them. 
NEH.6.18	 For many in Judah had sworn allegiance to him,
NEH.6.19	 They were telling me about his good deeds and then taking back to him the things I said.
NEH.7.1	 When the wall had been rebuilt and I had positioned the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, 
NEH.7.2	 I then put in charge over Jerusalem
NEH.7.3	 I
NEH.7.4	 Now the city was spread out
NEH.7.5	 My God placed it on my heart to gather the leaders,
NEH.7.6	 These are the people

NEH.9.15	 You provided bread from heaven for them in their time of hunger, and you brought forth water from the rock for them in their time of thirst. You told them to enter in order to possess the land that you had sworn
NEH.9.16	 “But they – our ancestors
NEH.9.17	 They refused to obey and did not recall your miracles that you had performed among them. Instead, they rebelled and appointed a leader to return to their bondage in Egypt.
NEH.9.18	 even when they made a cast image of a calf for themselves and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up from Egypt,’ or when they committed atrocious
NEH.9.19	 “Due to your great compassion you did not abandon them in the desert. The pillar of cloud did not stop guiding them in the path by day,
NEH.9.20	 You imparted your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths; you provided water for their thirst. 
NEH.9.21	 For forty years you sustained them. Even in the desert they never lacked anything. Their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.
NEH.9.22	 “You gave them kingdoms and peoples, and you allocated them to every corner of the land.
NEH.9.23	 You multiplied their descendants like the stars of the sky. You brought them to the land you had told their ancestors to enter in order to possess. 
NEH.9.24	 Their descendants
NEH.9.25	 They captured fortified cities and fertile land. They took possession of houses full of all sorts of good things – wells previously dug, vineyards, olive trees, and fruit trees in abundance. They ate until they were full
NEH.9.26	 “Nonetheless they grew disobedient and rebelled against you; they disregarded your law.
NEH.9.27	 Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who oppressed them. But in the time of their distress they called to you, and you heard from heaven. In your abundant compassion you provided them with deliverers to rescue them from
NEH.9.28	 “Then, when they were at rest again, they went back to doing evil before you. Then you abandoned them to
NEH.9.29	 And you solemnly admonished them in order to return them to your law, but they behaved presumptuously and did not obey your commandments. They sinned against your ordinances – those by which an individual, if he obeys them,
NEH.9.30	 You prolonged your kindness
NEH.9.31	 However, due to your abundant mercy you did not do away with them altogether; you did not abandon them. For you are a merciful and compassionate God.
NEH.9.32	 “So now, our God – the great, powerful, and awesome God, who keeps covenant fidelity
NEH.9.33	 You are righteous with regard to all that has happened to us, for you have acted faithfully.
NEH.9.34	 Our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our ancestors have not kept your law. They have not paid attention to your commandments or your testimonies by which you have solemnly admonished them. 
NEH.9.35	 Even when they were in their kingdom and benefiting from your incredible

NEH.11.1	 So the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem,
NEH.11.2	 The people gave their blessing on all the men who volunteered to settle in Jerusalem. 
NEH.11.3	 These are the provincial leaders
NEH.11.4	 some of the descendants of Judah and some of the descendants of Benjamin settled in Jerusalem.)

NEH.11.19	 And the gatekeepers: 
NEH.11.19	Akkub, Talmon and their colleagues who were guarding the gates – 172. 
NEH.11.20	 And the rest of the Israelites, with the priests and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, each on his own property. 
NEH.11.21	 The temple attendants were living on Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were over them.
NEH.11.22	 The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica. He was one of Asaph’s descendants who were the singers responsible for the service of the temple of God. 
NEH.11.23	 For they were under royal orders
NEH.11.24	 Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, one of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was an adviser to the king
NEH.11.25	 As for the settlements with their fields, some of the people of Judah settled in Kiriath Arba and its neighboring villages,
NEH.11.26	 in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth Pelet, 
NEH.11.27	 in Hazar Shual, in Beer Sheba and its villages,

NEH.12.8	 And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who together with his colleagues
NEH.12.9	 Bakbukiah and Unni,
NEH.12.10	 Jeshua was the father of
NEH.12.11	 Joiada was the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua. 
NEH.12.12	 In the days of Joiakim, these were the priests who were leaders of the families: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; 
NEH.12.13	 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
NEH.12.14	 of Malluch,

NEH.12.20	 of Sallu,
NEH.12.21	 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel. 
NEH.12.22	 As for the Levites,
NEH.12.23	 The descendants of Levi were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles
NEH.12.24	 And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their colleagues, who stood opposite them to offer praise and thanks, one contingent corresponding to the other, as specified by
NEH.12.25	 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who were guarding the storerooms at the gates. 
NEH.12.26	 These all served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priestly scribe.
NEH.12.27	 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem,
NEH.12.28	 The singers
NEH.12.29	 and from Beth Gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built settlements for themselves around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	 When the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they purified the people, the gates, and the wall. 
NEH.12.31	 I brought the leaders of Judah up on top of the wall, and I appointed two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed
NEH.12.32	 Going after them were Hoshaiah, half the leaders of Judah, 
NEH.12.33	 Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	 some of the priests
NEH.12.36	 and his colleagues – Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani – with musical instruments of
NEH.12.37	 They went over the Fountain Gate and continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall. They passed the house of David and continued on to the Water Gate toward the east. 
NEH.12.38	 The second choir was proceeding
NEH.12.39	 over the Ephraim Gate, the Jeshanah Gate,
NEH.12.40	 Then the two choirs that gave thanks took their stations
NEH.12.41	 and the priests – Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with their trumpets – 
NEH.12.42	 and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. The choirs sang loudly
NEH.12.43	 And on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced, for God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard from far away. 
NEH.12.44	 On that day men were appointed over the storerooms for the contributions, first fruits, and tithes, to gather into them from
NEH.12.45	 They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David and
NEH.12.46	 For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors
NEH.12.47	 So in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, all Israel was contributing the portions for the singers and gatekeepers, according to the daily need.
NEH.13.1	 On that day the book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing
NEH.13.2	 for they had not met the Israelites with food
NEH.13.3	 When they heard the law, they removed from Israel all who were of mixed ancestry.
NEH.13.4	 But prior to this time, Eliashib the priest, a relative of Tobiah, had been appointed over the storerooms
NEH.13.5	 He made for himself a large storeroom where previously they had been keeping
NEH.13.6	 During all this time I was not in Jerusalem,
NEH.13.7	 and I returned to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by supplying him with a storeroom in the courts of the temple of God. 
NEH.13.8	 I was very upset, and I threw all of Tobiah’s household possessions out of the storeroom. 
NEH.13.9	 Then I gave instructions that the storerooms should be purified, and I brought back the equipment
NEH.13.10	 I also discovered that the grain offerings for the Levites had not been provided, and that as a result the Levites and the singers who performed this work had all gone off to their fields. 
NEH.13.11	 So I registered a complaint with the leaders, asking “Why is the temple of God neglected?” Then I gathered them and reassigned them to their positions.
NEH.13.12	 Then all of Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil to the storerooms. 
NEH.13.13	 I gave instructions
NEH.13.14	 Please remember me for this, O my God, and do not wipe out the kindness that I have done for the temple of my God and for its services! 
NEH.13.15	 In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps of grain and loading them onto donkeys, along with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads, and bringing them to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them on the day that they sold these provisions. 
NEH.13.16	 The people from Tyre
NEH.13.17	 So I registered a complaint with the nobles of Judah, saying to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day? 
NEH.13.18	 Isn’t this the way your ancestors
NEH.13.19	 When the evening shadows
NEH.13.20	 The traders and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice. 
NEH.13.21	 But I warned them and said,
NEH.13.22	 Then I directed the Levites to purify themselves and come and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.
NEH.13.22	For this please remember me, O my God, and have pity on me in keeping with your great love. 
NEH.13.23	 Also in those days I saw the men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 
NEH.13.24	 Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod (or the language of one of the other peoples mentioned
NEH.13.25	 So I entered a complaint with them. I called down a curse on them, and I struck some of the men and pulled out their hair. I had them swear by God saying, “You will not marry off
NEH.13.26	 Was it not because of things like these that King Solomon of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made
NEH.13.27	 Should we then in your case hear that you do all this great evil, thereby being unfaithful to our God by marrying
NEH.13.28	 Now one of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. So I banished him from my sight.
NEH.13.29	 Please remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, the covenant of the priesthood,
NEH.13.30	 So I purified them of everything foreign, and I assigned specific
NEH.13.31	 I also provided for
NEH.13.31	Please remember me for good, O my God.
EST.1.1	 The following events happened
EST.1.2	 In those days, as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa
EST.1.3	 in the third
EST.1.4	 He displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his majestic greatness for a lengthy period of time
EST.1.5	 When those days
EST.1.6	 The furnishings included linen and purple curtains hung by cords of the finest linen
EST.1.7	 Drinks
EST.1.8	 There were no restrictions on the drinking,
EST.1.9	 Queen Vashti
EST.1.10	 On the seventh day, as King Ahasuerus was feeling the effects of the wine,
EST.1.11	 to bring Queen Vashti into the king’s presence wearing her royal high turban. He wanted to show the people and the officials her beauty, for she was very attractive.
EST.1.12	 But Queen Vashti refused
EST.1.13	 The king then inquired of the wise men who were discerners of the times – for it was the royal custom to confer with all those who were proficient in laws and legalities.
EST.1.14	 Those who were closest to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These men were the seven officials of Persia and Media who saw the king on a regular basis
EST.1.15	 The king asked,
EST.1.16	 Memucan then replied to the king and the officials, “The wrong of Queen Vashti is not against the king alone, but against all the officials and all the people who are throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 
EST.1.17	 For the matter concerning the queen will spread to all the women, leading them to treat their husbands with contempt, saying, ‘When King Ahasuerus gave orders to bring Queen Vashti into his presence, she would not come.’ 
EST.1.18	 And this very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard the matter concerning the queen will respond in the same way to all the royal officials, and there will be more than enough contempt and anger! 
EST.1.19	 If the king is so inclined,
EST.1.20	 And let the king’s decision which he will enact be disseminated
EST.1.21	 The matter seemed appropriate to the king and the officials. So the king acted on the advice of Memucan. 
EST.1.22	 He sent letters throughout all the royal provinces, to each province according to its own script and to each people according to its own language,
EST.2.1	 When these things had been accomplished
EST.2.2	 The king’s servants who attended him said, “Let a search be conducted in the king’s behalf for attractive young women.
EST.2.3	 And let the king appoint officers throughout all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the attractive young women to Susa the citadel, to the harem
EST.2.4	 Let the young woman whom the king finds most attractive
EST.2.5	 Now there happened to be a Jewish man in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai.
EST.2.6	 who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem
EST.2.7	 Now he was acting as the guardian
EST.2.8	 It so happened that when the king’s edict and his law became known
EST.2.9	 This young woman pleased him,
EST.2.10	 Now Esther had not disclosed her people or her lineage,
EST.2.11	 And day after day Mordecai used to walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem in order to learn how Esther was doing
EST.2.12	 At the end of the twelve months that were required for the women,
EST.2.13	 the woman would go to the king in the following way: Whatever she asked for would be provided for her to take with her from the harem to the royal palace. 
EST.2.14	 In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to a separate part
EST.2.15	 When it became the turn of Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai (who had raised her as if she were his own daughter
EST.2.16	 Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal residence in the tenth
EST.2.17	 And the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she met with his loving approval
EST.2.18	 Then the king prepared a large banquet for all his officials and his servants – it was actually Esther’s banquet. He also set aside a holiday for the provinces, and he provided for offerings at the king’s expense.
EST.2.19	 Now when the young women were being gathered again,
EST.2.20	 Esther was still not divulging her lineage or her people,
EST.2.21	 In those days while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan
EST.2.22	 When Mordecai learned of the conspiracy,
EST.2.23	 The king then had the matter investigated and, finding it to be so, had the two conspirators
EST.3.1	 Some time later
EST.3.2	 As a result,
EST.3.3	 Then the servants of the king who were at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why are you violating the king’s commandment?” 
EST.3.4	 And after they had spoken to him day after day
EST.3.5	 When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing or paying homage to him, he
EST.3.6	 But the thought of striking out against
EST.3.7	 In the first month (that is, the month of Nisan), in the twelfth year
EST.3.8	 Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a particular people
EST.3.9	 If the king is so inclined,
EST.3.10	 So the king removed his signet ring
EST.3.11	 The king replied to Haman, “Keep your money,
EST.3.12	 So the royal scribes
EST.3.13	 Letters were sent by the runners to all the king’s provinces stating that
EST.3.14	 A copy of this edict was to be presented as law throughout every province; it was to be made known to all the inhabitants,
EST.3.15	 The messengers
EST.4.1	 Now when Mordecai became aware of all that had been done, he
EST.4.2	 But he went no further than the king’s gate, for no one was permitted to enter the king’s gate clothed in sackcloth. 
EST.4.3	 Throughout each and every province where the king’s edict and law were announced
EST.4.4	 When Esther’s female attendants and her eunuchs came and informed her about Mordecai’s behavior,
EST.4.5	 So Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs who had been placed at her service,
EST.4.6	 So Hathach went to Mordecai at the plaza of the city in front of the king’s gate. 
EST.4.7	 Then Mordecai related to him everything that had happened to him, even the specific amount of money that Haman had offered to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews to be destroyed. 
EST.4.8	 He also gave him a written copy of the law that had been disseminated
EST.4.9	 So Hathach returned and related Mordecai’s instructions
EST.4.10	 Then Esther replied to Hathach with instructions for Mordecai: 
EST.4.11	 “All the servants of the king and the people of the king’s provinces know that there is only one law applicable
EST.4.12	 When Esther’s reply
EST.4.13	 he
EST.4.14	 “Don’t imagine that because you are part of the king’s household you will be the one Jew
EST.4.15	 Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: 
EST.4.16	 “Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa and fast in my behalf. Don’t eat and don’t drink for three days, night or day. My female attendants and I
EST.4.17	 So Mordecai set out to do everything that Esther had instructed him.
EST.5.1	 It so happened that on the third day Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the palace,
EST.5.2	 When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she met with his approval.
EST.5.3	 The king said to her, “What is on your mind,
EST.5.4	 Esther replied, “If the king is so inclined,
EST.5.5	 The king replied, “Find Haman quickly so that we can do as Esther requests.”
EST.5.5	So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
EST.5.6	 While at the banquet of wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your request? It shall be given to you. What is your petition? Ask for as much as half the kingdom,
EST.5.7	 Esther responded,
EST.5.8	 If I have found favor in the king’s sight and if the king is inclined
EST.5.9	 Now Haman went forth that day pleased and very much encouraged.
EST.5.10	 But Haman restrained himself and went on to his home.
EST.5.10	He then sent for his friends to join him,
EST.5.11	 Haman then recounted to them his fabulous wealth,
EST.5.12	 Haman said, “Furthermore, Queen Esther invited
EST.5.13	 Yet all of this fails to satisfy me so long as I have to see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”
EST.5.14	 Haman’s
EST.5.14	It seemed like a good idea to Haman, so he had the gallows built.
EST.6.1	 Throughout that night the king was unable to sleep,
EST.6.2	 it was found written that Mordecai had disclosed that Bigthana
EST.6.3	 The king asked, “What great honor
EST.6.4	 Then the king said, “Who is that in the courtyard?” Now Haman had come to the outer courtyard of the palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had constructed for him. 
EST.6.5	 The king’s attendants said to him, “It is Haman who is standing in the courtyard.” The king said, “Let him enter.”
EST.6.6	 So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haman thought to himself,
EST.6.7	 So Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honor, 
EST.6.8	 let them bring royal attire which the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden – one bearing the royal insignia!
EST.6.9	 Then let this clothing and this horse be given to one of the king’s noble officials. Let him
EST.6.10	 The king then said to Haman, “Go quickly! Take the clothing and the horse, just as you have described, and do as you just indicated to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king’s gate. Don’t neglect
EST.6.11	 So Haman took the clothing and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai. He led him about on the horse throughout the plaza of the city, calling before him, “So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!” 
EST.6.12	 Then Mordecai again sat at the king’s gate, while Haman hurried away to his home, mournful and with a veil over his head. 
EST.6.13	 Haman then related to his wife Zeresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. These wise men,
EST.6.14	 While they were still speaking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived. They quickly brought Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	 So the king and Haman came to dine
EST.7.2	 On the second day of the banquet of wine the king asked Esther, “What is your request, Queen Esther? It shall be granted to you. And what is your petition? Ask up to half the kingdom, and it shall be done!” 
EST.7.3	 Queen Esther replied, “If I have met with your approval,
EST.7.4	 For we have been sold
EST.7.5	 Then King Ahasuerus responded
EST.7.6	 Esther replied, “The oppressor and enemy is this evil Haman!”
EST.7.6	Then Haman became terrified in the presence of the king and queen. 
EST.7.7	 In rage the king arose from the banquet of wine and withdrew to the palace garden. Meanwhile, Haman stood to beg Queen Esther for his life,
EST.7.8	 When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet of wine, Haman was throwing himself down
EST.7.8	As these words left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. 
EST.7.9	 Harbona,
EST.7.9	The king said, “Hang him on it!” 
EST.7.10	 So they hanged Haman on the very gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. The king’s rage then abated.
EST.8.1	 On that same day King Ahasuerus gave the estate
EST.8.2	 The king then removed his signet ring (the very one he had taken back from Haman) and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther designated Mordecai to be in charge of Haman’s estate.
EST.8.3	 Then Esther again spoke with the king, falling at his feet. She wept and begged him for mercy, that he might nullify the evil of Haman the Agagite which he had intended against the Jews.
EST.8.4	 When the king extended to Esther the gold scepter, she
EST.8.5	 She said, “If the king is so inclined and if I have met with his approval and if the matter is agreeable to the king and if I am attractive to him, let an edict be written rescinding those recorded intentions of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite,
EST.8.6	 For how can I watch the calamity that will befall my people, and how can I watch the destruction of my relatives?”
EST.8.7	 King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Look, I have already given Haman’s estate to Esther, and he has been hanged on the gallows because he took hostile action
EST.8.8	 Now you write in the king’s name whatever in your opinion is appropriate concerning the Jews and seal it with the king’s signet ring. Any decree that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be rescinded.
EST.8.9	 The king’s scribes were quickly
EST.8.10	 Mordecai
EST.8.11	 The king thereby allowed the Jews who were in every city to assemble and to stand up for themselves – to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any army of whatever people or province that should become their adversaries, including their women and children,
EST.8.12	 This was to take place on a certain day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus – namely, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar). 
EST.8.13	 A copy of the edict was to be presented as law throughout each and every province and made known to all peoples, so that the Jews might be prepared on that
EST.8.14	 The couriers who were riding the royal horses went forth with the king’s edict without delay.
EST.8.15	 Now Mordecai went out from the king’s presence in purple and white royal attire, with a large golden crown and a purple linen mantle. The city of Susa shouted with joy.
EST.8.16	 For the Jews there was radiant happiness and joyous honor.
EST.8.17	 Throughout every province and throughout every city where the king’s edict and his law arrived, the Jews experienced happiness and joy, banquets and holidays. Many of the resident peoples
EST.9.1	 In the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), on its thirteenth day, the edict of the king and his law were to be executed. It was on this day that the enemies of the Jews had supposed that they would gain power over them. But contrary to expectations, the Jews gained power over their enemies. 
EST.9.2	 The Jews assembled themselves in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike out against those who were seeking their harm. No one was able to stand before them, for dread of them fell on all the peoples. 
EST.9.3	 All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who performed the king’s business were assisting the Jews, for the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them. 
EST.9.4	 Mordecai was of high rank
EST.9.5	 The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, bringing death and destruction, and they did as they pleased with their enemies. 
EST.9.6	 In Susa the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. 
EST.9.7	 In addition, they also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
EST.9.10	 the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not confiscate their property. 
EST.9.11	 On that same day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was brought to the king’s attention. 
EST.9.12	 Then the king said to Queen Esther, “In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman! What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? What is your request? It shall be given to you. What other petition do you have? It shall be done.”
EST.9.13	 Esther replied, “If the king is so inclined, let the Jews who are in Susa be permitted to act tomorrow also according to today’s law, and let them hang the ten sons of Haman on the gallows.”
EST.9.14	 So the king issued orders for this to be done. A law was passed in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged. 
EST.9.15	 The Jews who were in Susa then assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they killed three hundred men in Susa. But they did not confiscate their property.
EST.9.16	 The rest of the Jews who were throughout the provinces of the king assembled in order to stand up for themselves and to have rest from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand
EST.9.17	 All of this happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. They then rested on the fourteenth day and made it a day for banqueting and happiness.
EST.9.18	 But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and rested on the fifteenth, making it a day for banqueting and happiness. 
EST.9.19	 This is why the Jews who are in the rural country – those who live in rural cities – set aside the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a holiday for happiness, banqueting, holiday, and sending gifts to one another.
EST.9.20	 Mordecai wrote these matters down and sent letters to all the Jews who were throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 
EST.9.21	 to have them observe the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the month of Adar each year 
EST.9.22	 as the time when the Jews gave themselves rest from their enemies – the month when their trouble was turned to happiness and their mourning to a holiday. These were to be days of banqueting, happiness, sending gifts to one another, and providing for the poor.
EST.9.23	 So the Jews committed themselves to continue what they had begun to do and to what Mordecai had written to them. 
EST.9.24	 For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised plans against the Jews to destroy them. He had cast 
EST.9.25	 But when the matter came to the king’s attention, the king
EST.9.26	 For this reason these days are known as 
EST.9.27	 Therefore, because of the account found in this letter and what they had faced in this regard and what had happened to them, the Jews established as binding on themselves, their descendants, and all who joined their company that they should observe these two days without fail, just as written and at the appropriate time on an annual basis. 
EST.9.28	 These days were to be remembered and to be celebrated in every generation and in every family, every province, and every city. The Jews were not to fail to observe these days of Purim; the remembrance of them was not to cease among their descendants.
EST.9.29	 So Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm this second
EST.9.30	 Letters were sent
EST.9.31	 to establish these days of Purim in their proper times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established, and just as they had established both for themselves and their descendants, matters pertaining to fasting and lamentation. 
EST.9.32	 Esther’s command established these matters of Purim, and the matter was officially recorded.
EST.10.1	 King Ahasuerus then imposed forced labor on the land and on the coastlands of the sea. 
EST.10.2	 Now all the actions carried out under his authority and his great achievements, along with an exact statement concerning the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king promoted, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia? 
EST.10.3	 Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus. He was the highest-ranking
JOB.1.1	 There was a man
JOB.1.2	 Seven
JOB.1.3	 His possessions
JOB.1.4	 Now his sons used to go
JOB.1.5	 When
JOB.1.6	 Now the day came when
JOB.1.7	 The
JOB.1.8	 So the
JOB.1.9	 Then Satan answered the
JOB.1.10	 Have you
JOB.1.11	 But
JOB.1.12	 So the
JOB.1.13	 Now the day
JOB.1.14	 and a messenger came to Job, saying, “The oxen were plowing
JOB.1.15	 and the Sabeans
JOB.1.16	 While this one was still speaking,
JOB.1.17	 While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “The Chaldeans
JOB.1.18	 While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.19	 and suddenly
JOB.1.20	 Then Job got up
JOB.1.21	 He said, “Naked
JOB.1.22	 In all this Job did not sin, nor did he charge God with moral impropriety.

JOB.2.8	 Job took a shard of broken pottery to scrape
JOB.2.9	 Then
JOB.2.10	 But he replied,
JOB.2.11	 When Job’s three friends heard about all this calamity that had happened to him, each of them came from his own country
JOB.2.12	 But when they gazed intently
JOB.2.13	 Then they sat down with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, yet no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain
JOB.3.1	 After this Job opened his mouth
JOB.3.2	 Job spoke up
JOB.3.3	 “Let the day on which
JOB.3.3	and the night that said,

JOB.3.5	let whatever blackens the day
JOB.3.6	 That night – let darkness seize
JOB.3.6	let it not be included
JOB.3.6	let it not enter among the number of the months!
JOB.3.7	 Indeed,
JOB.3.7	let no shout of joy
JOB.3.8	 Let those who curse the day

JOB.3.12	that I might nurse at them?
JOB.3.13	 For now
JOB.3.13	and
JOB.3.13	I would be asleep and then at peace
JOB.3.14	 with kings and counselors of the earth
JOB.3.14	who built for themselves places now desolate,

JOB.4.2	 “If someone

JOB.5.27	 Look, we have investigated this, so it is true.
JOB.5.27	Hear it,
JOB.6.1	 Then Job responded:
JOB.6.2	 “Oh,

JOB.7.9	so the one who goes down to the grave
JOB.7.9	does not come up again.
JOB.7.10	 He returns no more to his house,

JOB.8.1	 Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke up and said:

JOB.9.1	 Then Job answered:
JOB.9.2	 “Truly,
JOB.9.2	But how
JOB.9.3	 If someone wishes
JOB.9.3	he cannot answer
JOB.9.4	 He is wise in heart
JOB.9.4	who has resisted
JOB.9.5	 He who removes mountains suddenly,
JOB.9.5	who overturns them in his anger;
JOB.9.6	 he who shakes the earth out of its place
JOB.9.6	so that its pillars tremble;
JOB.9.7	 he who commands the sun and
JOB.9.7	and seals up
JOB.9.8	 he alone spreads out the heavens,
JOB.9.8	and treads
JOB.9.9	 he makes the Bear,
JOB.9.9	and the constellations of the southern sky;
JOB.9.10	 he does great and unsearchable things,
JOB.9.10	and wonderful things without number.
JOB.9.11	 If
JOB.9.11	if he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
JOB.9.12	 If he snatches away,
JOB.9.12	Who dares to say to him, ‘What are you doing?’
JOB.9.13	 God does not restrain his anger;
JOB.9.13	under him the helpers of Rahab
JOB.9.14	 “How much less,
JOB.9.14	and choose my words
JOB.9.15	 Although
JOB.9.15	I could not answer him;
JOB.9.15	I could only plead
JOB.9.16	 If I summoned him, and he answered me,
JOB.9.16	I would not believe
JOB.9.16	that he would be listening to my voice – 
JOB.9.17	 he who
JOB.9.17	and multiplies my wounds for no reason.
JOB.9.18	 He does not allow
JOB.9.18	for he fills
JOB.9.19	 If it is a matter of strength,
JOB.9.19	most certainly
JOB.9.19	And if it is a matter of justice, 
JOB.9.19	he will say, ‘Who will summon me?’
JOB.9.20	 Although I am innocent,
JOB.9.20	my mouth
JOB.9.20	although I am blameless, 
JOB.9.20	it would declare me perverse.
JOB.9.21	 I am blameless.
JOB.9.21	I despise my life.
JOB.9.22	 “It is all one!
JOB.9.22	‘He destroys the blameless and the guilty.’
JOB.9.23	 If a scourge brings sudden death,
JOB.9.23	he mocks
JOB.9.24	 If a land

JOB.9.25	 “My days
JOB.9.25	they speed by without seeing happiness.
JOB.9.26	 They glide by
JOB.9.26	like an eagle that swoops
JOB.9.27	 If I say,

JOB.9.30	and make my hands clean with lye,
JOB.9.31	 then you plunge me into a slimy pit
JOB.9.31	and my own clothes abhor me.

JOB.10.1	 “I

JOB.10.3	 Is it good for you
JOB.10.3	to
JOB.10.3	while

JOB.10.4	 “Do you have eyes of flesh,

JOB.10.5	or your years like the years

JOB.10.6	and inquire about my sin,
JOB.10.7	 although you know
JOB.10.7	and that there is no one who can deliver
JOB.10.7	out of your hand?
JOB.10.8	 “Your hands have shaped
JOB.10.8	but
JOB.10.9	 Remember that you have made me as with
JOB.10.9	will
JOB.10.10	 Did you not pour
JOB.10.10	and curdle
JOB.10.11	 You clothed
JOB.10.11	and knit me together
JOB.10.12	 You gave me
JOB.10.12	and your intervention
JOB.10.13	 “But these things
JOB.10.13	I know that this
JOB.10.14	 If I sinned, then you would watch me
JOB.10.14	and you would not acquit me of my iniquity.
JOB.10.15	 If I am guilty,
JOB.10.15	and if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head;
JOB.10.15	I am full of shame,
JOB.10.15	and satiated with my affliction.
JOB.10.16	 If I lift myself up,
JOB.10.16	you hunt me as a fierce lion,
JOB.10.16	and again
JOB.10.17	 You bring new witnesses
JOB.10.17	and increase your anger against me;

JOB.10.18	 “Why then did you bring me out from the womb?
JOB.10.18	I should have died
JOB.10.18	and no eye would have seen me!
JOB.10.19	 I should have been as though I had never existed;
JOB.10.19	I should have been carried 
JOB.10.19	right from the womb to the grave!
JOB.10.20	 Are not my days few?
JOB.10.20	Cease,
JOB.10.20	that I may find a little comfort,
JOB.10.21	 before I depart, never to return,
JOB.10.21	to the land of darkness 
JOB.10.21	and the deepest shadow,
JOB.10.22	 to the land of utter darkness, 
JOB.10.22	like the deepest darkness,
JOB.10.22	and the deepest shadow and disorder,
JOB.10.22	where even the light
JOB.11.1	 Then Zophar the Naamathite spoke up and said:
JOB.11.2	 “Should not this
JOB.11.2	or should this
JOB.11.2	be vindicated?
JOB.11.3	 Will your idle talk
JOB.11.3	and will no one rebuke
JOB.11.4	 For you have said, ‘My teaching
JOB.11.4	and I am pure in your sight.’
JOB.11.5	 But if only God would speak,
JOB.11.5	if only he would open his lips against you,
JOB.11.6	 and reveal to you the secrets of wisdom – 
JOB.11.6	for true wisdom has two sides
JOB.11.6	so that you would know
JOB.11.6	that God has forgiven some of your sins.
JOB.11.7	 “Can you discover
JOB.11.7	Can you find out
JOB.11.7	the perfection of the Almighty?
JOB.11.8	 It is higher
JOB.11.8	It is deeper than Sheol
JOB.11.9	 Its measure is longer than the earth,
JOB.11.9	and broader than the sea.
JOB.11.10	 If he comes by
JOB.11.10	and convenes a court,
JOB.11.10	then who can prevent
JOB.11.11	 For he
JOB.11.11	when he sees evil, will he not
JOB.11.12	 But an empty man will become wise,
JOB.11.12	when a wild donkey’s colt is born a human being.
JOB.11.13	 “As for you,

JOB.11.15	 For
JOB.11.15	without

JOB.11.15	and will not fear.
JOB.11.16	 For you
JOB.11.16	you will remember it 
JOB.11.16	like water that
JOB.11.17	 And life
JOB.11.17	though there be darkness,
JOB.11.17	it will be like the morning.
JOB.11.18	 And you will be secure, because there is hope;
JOB.11.18	you will be protected
JOB.11.18	and will take your rest in safety.
JOB.11.19	 You will lie down with
JOB.11.19	and many will seek your favor.
JOB.11.20	 But the eyes of the wicked fail,
JOB.11.20	and escape
JOB.11.20	their one hope
JOB.12.1	 Then Job answered:
JOB.12.2	 “Without a doubt you are the people,
JOB.12.2	and wisdom will die with you.
JOB.12.3	 I also have understanding
JOB.12.3	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.12.3	Who does not know such things as these?
JOB.12.4	 I am
JOB.12.4	I, who called on God and whom he answered
JOB.12.4	a righteous and blameless

JOB.12.9	that the hand of the 
JOB.12.10	 in whose hand

JOB.12.12	 Is not wisdom found among the aged?
JOB.12.12	Does not long life bring understanding?
JOB.12.13	 “With God
JOB.12.13	counsel and understanding are his.
JOB.12.14	 If
JOB.12.14	if he imprisons a person, there is no escape.
JOB.12.15	 If he holds back the waters, then they dry up;
JOB.12.15	if he releases them,
JOB.12.16	 With him are strength and prudence;
JOB.12.16	both the one who goes astray
JOB.12.16	and the one who misleads are his.
JOB.12.17	 He
JOB.12.17	and makes judges
JOB.12.18	 He loosens
JOB.12.18	and binds a loincloth
JOB.12.19	 He leads priests away stripped
JOB.12.19	and overthrows
JOB.12.20	 He deprives the trusted advisers
JOB.12.20	and takes away the discernment
JOB.12.21	 He pours contempt on noblemen
JOB.12.21	and disarms
JOB.12.22	 He reveals the deep things of darkness,
JOB.12.22	and brings deep shadows
JOB.12.23	 He makes nations great,
JOB.12.23	he extends the boundaries of nations
JOB.12.23	and disperses
JOB.12.24	 He deprives the leaders of the earth
JOB.12.24	of their understanding;
JOB.12.24	he makes them wander 
JOB.12.24	in a trackless desert waste.
JOB.12.25	 They grope about in darkness
JOB.12.25	he makes them stagger
JOB.13.1	 “Indeed, my eyes have seen all this,
JOB.13.1	my ears have heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	 What you know,
JOB.13.2	I am not inferior
JOB.13.3	 But I wish to speak
JOB.13.3	and I desire to argue
JOB.13.4	 But you, however, are inventors of lies;
JOB.13.4	all of you are worthless physicians!
JOB.13.5	 If only you would keep completely silent!
JOB.13.5	For you, that would be wisdom.
JOB.13.6	 “Listen now to my argument,
JOB.13.6	and be attentive to my lips’ contentions.
JOB.13.7	 Will you speak wickedly
JOB.13.7	Will you speak deceitfully for him?
JOB.13.8	 Will you show him partiality?
JOB.13.8	Will you argue the case
JOB.13.9	 Would it turn out well if he would examine

JOB.13.15	 Even if he slays me, I will hope in him;
JOB.13.15	I will surely
JOB.13.16	 Moreover, this will become my deliverance,
JOB.13.16	for no godless person would come before him.
JOB.13.17	 Listen carefully
JOB.13.17	let your ears be attentive to my explanation.
JOB.13.18	 See now,
JOB.13.18	I know that I am right.
JOB.13.19	 Who
JOB.13.19	If anyone can, I will be silent and die.
JOB.13.20	 Only in two things spare me,
JOB.13.20	and then I will not hide from your face:
JOB.13.21	 Remove
JOB.13.21	and stop making me afraid with your terror.
JOB.13.22	 Then call,
JOB.13.22	or I will speak, and you respond to me.
JOB.13.23	 How many are my
JOB.13.23	Show me my transgression and my sin.
JOB.13.24	 Why do you hide your face
JOB.13.24	and regard me as your enemy?
JOB.13.25	 Do you wish to torment
JOB.13.25	and chase after dry chaff?
JOB.13.26	 For you write down
JOB.13.26	and cause me to inherit the sins of my youth.
JOB.13.27	 And you put my feet in the stocks
JOB.13.27	and you watch all my movements;
JOB.13.27	you put marks
JOB.13.28	 So I
JOB.13.28	like a garment eaten by moths. 
JOB.14.1	 “Man, born of woman,
JOB.14.1	lives but a few days,

JOB.14.3	 Do you fix your eye
JOB.14.3	And do you bring me
JOB.14.4	 Who can make
JOB.14.4	No one!
JOB.14.5	 Since man’s days
JOB.14.5	the number of his months is under your control;
JOB.14.5	you have set his limit
JOB.14.6	 Look away from him and let him desist,
JOB.14.6	until he fulfills
JOB.14.7	 “But there is hope for

JOB.14.9	 at the scent
JOB.14.9	and put forth
JOB.14.10	 But man

JOB.14.11	 As
JOB.14.11	or a river drains away and dries up,
JOB.14.12	 so man lies down and does not rise;
JOB.14.12	until the heavens are no more,
JOB.14.12	they
JOB.14.12	nor arise from their sleep.
JOB.14.13	 “O that
JOB.14.13	and conceal me till your anger has passed!
JOB.14.13	O that you would set me a time
JOB.14.13	and then remember me!
JOB.14.14	 If a man dies, will he live again?
JOB.14.14	All the days of my hard service
JOB.14.14	until my release comes.
JOB.14.15	 You will call
JOB.14.15	you will long for
JOB.14.16	 “Surely now you count my steps;
JOB.14.16	then you would not mark
JOB.14.17	 My offenses would be sealed up
JOB.14.17	you would cover over
JOB.14.18	 But as
JOB.14.18	and as a rock will be removed from its place,
JOB.14.19	 as water wears away stones,
JOB.14.19	and torrents
JOB.14.19	so you destroy man’s hope.
JOB.14.20	 You overpower him once for all,
JOB.14.20	and he departs;
JOB.14.20	you change
JOB.14.20	and send him away.
JOB.14.21	 If
JOB.14.21	he does not know it;
JOB.14.21	if they are brought low, 
JOB.14.21	he does not see
JOB.14.22	 Only his flesh has pain for himself,

JOB.15.1	 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
JOB.15.2	 “Does a wise man answer with blustery knowledge,
JOB.15.2	or fill his belly
JOB.15.3	 Does he argue
JOB.15.3	with words that have no value in them?

JOB.15.4	and hinder
JOB.15.5	 Your sin inspires

JOB.15.9	What do you understand that we don’t understand?
JOB.15.10	 The gray-haired
JOB.15.10	men far older than your father.
JOB.15.11	 Are God’s consolations
JOB.15.11	or a word spoken
JOB.15.12	 Why
JOB.15.12	and why do your eyes flash,
JOB.15.13	 when you turn your rage
JOB.15.13	and allow such words to escape
JOB.15.14	 What is man that he should be pure,
JOB.15.14	or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?
JOB.15.15	 If God places no trust in his holy ones,
JOB.15.15	if even the heavens
JOB.15.16	 how much less man, who is abominable and corrupt,
JOB.15.16	who drinks in evil like water!
JOB.15.17	 “I will explain to you; 
JOB.15.17	listen to me,

JOB.15.18	 what wise men declare,
JOB.15.18	hiding nothing,

JOB.15.19	 to whom alone the land was given
JOB.15.19	when no foreigner passed among them.
JOB.15.20	 All his days
JOB.15.20	throughout the number of the years 
JOB.15.20	that
JOB.15.21	 Terrifying sounds fill
JOB.15.21	in a time of peace marauders
JOB.15.22	 He does not expect
JOB.15.22	he is marked for the sword;
JOB.15.23	 he wanders about – food for vultures;
JOB.15.23	he knows that the day of darkness is at hand.
JOB.15.24	 Distress and anguish
JOB.15.24	they prevail against him 
JOB.15.24	like a king ready to launch an attack,
JOB.15.25	 for he stretches out his hand against God,
JOB.15.25	and vaunts himself
JOB.15.26	 defiantly charging against him
JOB.15.26	with a thick, strong shield!
JOB.15.27	 Because he covered his face with fat,
JOB.15.27	and made
JOB.15.28	 he lived in ruined towns
JOB.15.28	and in houses where
JOB.15.28	where they are ready to crumble into heaps.
JOB.15.29	 He will not grow rich,
JOB.15.29	and his wealth will not endure,
JOB.15.29	nor will his possessions
JOB.15.30	 He will not escape the darkness;
JOB.15.30	a flame will wither his shoots
JOB.15.30	and he will depart 
JOB.15.30	by the breath of God’s mouth.
JOB.15.31	 Let him not trust in what is worthless,
JOB.15.31	deceiving himself;
JOB.15.31	for worthlessness will be his reward.
JOB.15.32	 Before his time
JOB.15.32	and his branches will not flourish.
JOB.15.33	 Like a vine he will let his sour grapes fall,
JOB.15.33	and like an olive tree 
JOB.15.33	he will shed his blossoms.
JOB.15.34	 For the company of the godless is barren,
JOB.15.34	and fire
JOB.15.35	 They conceive
JOB.15.35	their belly
JOB.16.1	 Then Job replied:
JOB.16.2	 “I have heard many things like these before.
JOB.16.2	What miserable comforters
JOB.16.3	 Will
JOB.16.3	Or what provokes
JOB.16.4	 I also could speak
JOB.16.4	if
JOB.16.4	I could pile up
JOB.16.4	and I could shake my head at you.
JOB.16.5	 But
JOB.16.5	comfort from my lips would bring
JOB.16.6	 “But
JOB.16.6	and if I refrain from speaking
JOB.16.6	 – how
JOB.16.7	 Surely now he

JOB.16.11	and throws
JOB.16.12	 I was in peace, and he has shattered me.
JOB.16.12	He has seized me by the neck and crushed me.
JOB.16.12	He has made me his target;
JOB.16.13	 his archers
JOB.16.13	Without pity
JOB.16.13	and pours out my gall
JOB.16.14	 He breaks through against me, time and time again;
JOB.16.14	he rushes
JOB.16.15	 I have sewed sackcloth on my skin,
JOB.16.15	and buried
JOB.16.16	 my face is reddened
JOB.16.16	and on my eyelids there is a deep darkness,
JOB.16.17	 although
JOB.16.17	and my prayer is pure.

JOB.17.1	 My spirit is broken,
JOB.17.1	my days have faded out,
JOB.17.1	the grave
JOB.17.2	 Surely mockery
JOB.17.2	my eyes must dwell on their hostility.
JOB.17.3	 Make then my pledge
JOB.17.3	Who else will put up security for me?
JOB.17.4	 Because
JOB.17.4	therefore you will not exalt them.
JOB.17.5	 If a man denounces his friends for personal gain,
JOB.17.5	the eyes of his children will fail.
JOB.17.6	 He has made me
JOB.17.6	I am the one in whose face they spit.
JOB.17.7	 My eyes have grown dim
JOB.17.7	my whole frame
JOB.17.8	 Upright men are appalled
JOB.17.8	the innocent man is troubled
JOB.17.9	 But the righteous man holds to his way,
JOB.17.9	and the one with clean hands grows stronger.
JOB.17.10	 “But turn, all of you,
JOB.17.10	I will not find a wise man among you.

JOB.18.3	 Why should we be regarded as beasts,
JOB.18.3	and considered stupid
JOB.18.4	 You who tear yourself

JOB.18.5	 “Yes,

JOB.18.9	a snare
JOB.18.10	 A rope is hidden for him
JOB.18.10	and a trap for him
JOB.18.11	 Terrors
JOB.18.11	and dog
JOB.18.12	 Calamity is
JOB.18.12	and misfortune is ready at his side.
JOB.18.13	 It eats away parts of his skin;
JOB.18.13	the most terrible death
JOB.18.14	 He is dragged from the security of his tent,
JOB.18.14	and marched off
JOB.18.15	 Fire resides in his tent;
JOB.18.15	over his residence burning sulfur is scattered.
JOB.18.16	 Below his roots dry up,
JOB.18.16	and his branches wither above.
JOB.18.17	 His memory perishes from the earth,
JOB.18.17	he has no name in the land.
JOB.18.18	 He is driven
JOB.18.18	and is banished from the world.
JOB.18.19	 He has neither children nor descendants
JOB.18.19	no survivor in those places he once stayed.
JOB.18.20	 People of the west
JOB.18.20	people of the east are seized with horror,
JOB.18.21	 ‘Surely such is the residence
JOB.18.21	and this is the place of one who has not known God.’”
JOB.19.1	 Then Job answered:
JOB.19.2	 “How long will you torment me
JOB.19.2	and crush
JOB.19.3	 These ten times
JOB.19.3	you are not ashamed to attack me!
JOB.19.4	 But even if it were
JOB.19.4	my error
JOB.19.5	 If indeed
JOB.19.5	and plead my disgrace against me,
JOB.19.6	 know
JOB.19.6	and encircled
JOB.19.7	 “If
JOB.19.7	I receive no answer;
JOB.19.7	I cry for help, 
JOB.19.7	but there is no justice.
JOB.19.8	 He has blocked
JOB.19.8	and has set darkness
JOB.19.9	 He has stripped me of my honor
JOB.19.9	and has taken the crown off my head.
JOB.19.10	 He tears me down
JOB.19.10	he uproots
JOB.19.11	 Thus
JOB.19.11	and he considers me among his enemies.
JOB.19.12	 His troops
JOB.19.12	they throw up
JOB.19.12	and they camp around my tent.
JOB.19.13	 “He has put my relatives
JOB.19.13	my acquaintances only
JOB.19.14	 My kinsmen have failed me;
JOB.19.14	my friends
JOB.19.15	 My guests
JOB.19.15	consider
JOB.19.15	I am a foreigner
JOB.19.16	 I summon
JOB.19.16	even though I implore
JOB.19.17	 My breath is repulsive
JOB.19.17	I am loathsome
JOB.19.18	 Even youngsters have scorned me;
JOB.19.18	when I get up,
JOB.19.19	 All my closest friends
JOB.19.19	and those whom
JOB.19.20	 My bones stick to my skin and my flesh;
JOB.19.20	I have escaped
JOB.19.21	 Have pity on me, my friends, have pity on me,
JOB.19.21	for the hand of God has struck me.
JOB.19.22	 Why do you pursue me like God does?
JOB.19.22	Will you never be satiated with my flesh?
JOB.19.23	 “O that
JOB.19.23	O that they were written on a scroll,
JOB.19.24	 that with an iron chisel and with lead
JOB.19.24	they were engraved in a rock forever!
JOB.19.25	 As for me, I know that my Redeemer
JOB.19.25	and that as the last
JOB.19.25	he will stand upon the earth.
JOB.19.26	 And after my skin has been destroyed,
JOB.19.26	yet in my flesh
JOB.19.27	 whom I will see for myself,
JOB.19.27	and whom my own eyes will behold, 
JOB.19.27	and not another.
JOB.19.27	My heart
JOB.19.28	 If you say, ‘How we will pursue him,
JOB.19.28	since the root of the trouble is found in him!’
JOB.19.29	 Fear the sword yourselves,
JOB.19.29	for wrath
JOB.19.29	so that you may know 
JOB.19.29	that there is judgment.”
JOB.20.1	 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
JOB.20.2	 “This is why
JOB.20.2	because of my feelings
JOB.20.3	 When
JOB.20.3	then my understanding
JOB.20.4	 “Surely you know
JOB.20.4	ever since humankind was placed
JOB.20.5	 that the elation of the wicked is brief,
JOB.20.5	the joy of the godless
JOB.20.6	 Even though his stature
JOB.20.6	and his head touches the clouds,
JOB.20.7	 he will perish forever, like his own excrement;
JOB.20.7	those who used to see him will say, ‘Where is he?’
JOB.20.8	 Like a dream he flies away, never again to be found,
JOB.20.8	and like a vision of the night he is put to flight.
JOB.20.9	 People
JOB.20.9	and the place where he was 
JOB.20.9	will recognize him no longer.
JOB.20.10	 His sons must recompense
JOB.20.10	his own hands
JOB.20.11	 His bones
JOB.20.11	but that vigor will lie down with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	 “If
JOB.20.12	and he hides it under his tongue,
JOB.20.13	 if he retains it for himself
JOB.20.13	and does not let it go,
JOB.20.13	and holds it fast in his mouth,
JOB.20.14	 his food is turned sour
JOB.20.14	it becomes the venom of serpents
JOB.20.15	 The wealth that he consumed
JOB.20.15	God will make him throw it out
JOB.20.16	 He sucks the poison
JOB.20.16	the fangs
JOB.20.17	 He will not look on the streams,
JOB.20.17	the rivers, which are the torrents
JOB.20.17	of honey and butter.
JOB.20.18	 He gives back the ill-gotten gain
JOB.20.18	without assimilating it;
JOB.20.18	he will not enjoy the wealth from his commerce.
JOB.20.19	 For he has oppressed the poor and abandoned them;
JOB.20.19	he has seized a house which he did not build.
JOB.20.20	 For he knows no satisfaction in his appetite;
JOB.20.20	he does not let anything he desires
JOB.20.21	 “Nothing is left for him to devour;
JOB.20.21	that is why his prosperity does not last.
JOB.20.22	 In the fullness of his sufficiency,
JOB.20.22	distress
JOB.20.22	the full force of misery will come upon him.
JOB.20.23	 “While he is
JOB.20.23	God
JOB.20.23	and rains down his blows upon him.
JOB.20.24	 If he flees from an iron weapon,
JOB.20.24	then an arrow
JOB.20.25	 When he pulls it out
JOB.20.25	the gleaming point
JOB.20.25	terrors come over him.
JOB.20.26	 Total darkness waits to receive his treasures;
JOB.20.26	a fire which has not been kindled
JOB.20.26	will consume him
JOB.20.26	and devour what is left in his tent.
JOB.20.27	 The heavens reveal his iniquity;
JOB.20.27	the earth rises up against him.
JOB.20.28	 A flood will carry off his house,
JOB.20.28	rushing waters on the day of God’s wrath.
JOB.20.29	 Such is the lot God allots the wicked,
JOB.20.29	and the heritage of his appointment
JOB.21.1	 Then Job answered:
JOB.21.2	 “Listen carefully
JOB.21.2	let this be
JOB.21.3	 Bear with me
JOB.21.3	and after I have spoken
JOB.21.4	 Is my
JOB.21.4	If so,
JOB.21.5	 Look
JOB.21.5	put your hands over your mouths.
JOB.21.6	 For, when I think
JOB.21.6	and my body feels a shudder.
JOB.21.7	 “Why do the wicked go on living,
JOB.21.7	grow old,
JOB.21.8	 Their children
JOB.21.8	in their presence,
JOB.21.8	their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	 Their houses are safe
JOB.21.9	and no rod of punishment
JOB.21.10	 Their bulls
JOB.21.10	their cows calve and do not miscarry.
JOB.21.11	 They allow their children to run
JOB.21.11	their little ones dance about.
JOB.21.12	 They sing
JOB.21.12	and make merry to the sound of the flute.
JOB.21.13	 They live out
JOB.21.13	and go down
JOB.21.14	 So they say to God, ‘Turn away from us!
JOB.21.14	We do not want to
JOB.21.15	 Who is the Almighty, that
JOB.21.15	What would we gain 
JOB.21.15	if we were to pray
JOB.21.16	 But their prosperity is not their own doing.
JOB.21.16	The counsel of the wicked is far from me!
JOB.21.17	 “How often
JOB.21.17	How often does their
JOB.21.17	How often does God apportion pain
JOB.21.18	 How often
JOB.21.18	and like chaff swept away
JOB.21.19	 You may say,
JOB.21.19	Instead let him repay
JOB.21.19	so that
JOB.21.20	 Let his own eyes see his destruction;
JOB.21.20	let him drink of the anger of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	 For what is his interest
JOB.21.21	after his death,
JOB.21.21	when the number of his months 
JOB.21.21	has been broken off?
JOB.21.22	 Can anyone teach
JOB.21.22	since
JOB.21.23	 “One man dies in his full vigor,
JOB.21.23	completely secure and prosperous,
JOB.21.24	 his body
JOB.21.24	and the marrow of his bones moist.
JOB.21.25	 And another man
JOB.21.25	never having tasted
JOB.21.26	 Together they lie down in the dust,
JOB.21.26	and worms cover over them both.
JOB.21.27	 “Yes, I know what you are thinking,
JOB.21.27	the schemes
JOB.21.28	 For you say, 
JOB.21.28	‘Where now is the nobleman’s house,
JOB.21.28	and where are the tents in which the wicked lived?’
JOB.21.29	 Have you never questioned those who travel the roads?
JOB.21.29	Do you not recognize their accounts
JOB.21.30	 that the evil man is spared
JOB.21.30	from the day of his misfortune,
JOB.21.30	that he is delivered
JOB.21.30	from the day of God’s wrath?
JOB.21.31	 No one denounces his conduct to his face;
JOB.21.31	no one repays him for what
JOB.21.32	 And when he is carried to the tombs,
JOB.21.32	and watch is kept
JOB.21.33	 The clods of the torrent valley
JOB.21.33	behind him everybody follows in procession,
JOB.21.33	and before him goes a countless throng.
JOB.21.34	 So how can you console me with your futile words?
JOB.21.34	Nothing is left of your answers but deception!”
JOB.22.1	 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
JOB.22.2	 “Is it to God that a strong man is of benefit?
JOB.22.2	Is it to him that even a wise man is profitable?
JOB.22.3	 Is it of any special benefit
JOB.22.3	that you should be righteous,
JOB.22.3	or is it any gain to him
JOB.22.3	that you make your ways blameless?
JOB.22.4	 Is it because of your piety
JOB.22.4	and goes to judgment with you?
JOB.22.5	 Is not your wickedness great
JOB.22.5	and is there no end to your iniquity?
JOB.22.6	 “For you took pledges
JOB.22.6	for no reason,
JOB.22.6	and you stripped the clothing from the naked.
JOB.22.7	 You gave the weary
JOB.22.7	and from the hungry you withheld food.
JOB.22.8	 Although you were a powerful man,
JOB.22.8	an honored man
JOB.22.9	 you sent widows away empty-handed,
JOB.22.9	and the arms
JOB.22.10	 That is why snares surround you,
JOB.22.10	and why sudden fear terrifies you,
JOB.22.11	 why it is so dark you cannot see,
JOB.22.11	and why a flood
JOB.22.12	 “Is not God on high in heaven?
JOB.22.12	And see
JOB.22.13	 But you have said, ‘What does God know?
JOB.22.13	Does he judge through such deep darkness?
JOB.22.14	 Thick clouds are a veil for him, so he does not see us,
JOB.22.14	as he goes back and forth
JOB.22.14	in the vault
JOB.22.15	 Will you keep to the old path
JOB.22.15	that evil men have walked – 
JOB.22.16	 men
JOB.22.16	when the flood
JOB.22.16	on their foundations?
JOB.22.17	 They were saying to God, ‘Turn away from us,’
JOB.22.17	and ‘What can the Almighty do to us?’
JOB.22.18	 But it was he
JOB.22.18	with good things – 
JOB.22.18	yet the counsel of the wicked
JOB.22.18	was far from me.
JOB.22.19	 The righteous see their destruction
JOB.22.19	the innocent mock them scornfully,
JOB.22.20	 ‘Surely our enemies
JOB.22.20	and fire consumes their wealth.’
JOB.22.21	 “Reconcile yourself
JOB.22.21	and be at peace
JOB.22.21	in this way your prosperity will be good.
JOB.22.22	 Accept instruction
JOB.22.22	and store up his words
JOB.22.23	 If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up;
JOB.22.23	if you remove wicked behavior far from your tent,
JOB.22.24	 and throw
JOB.22.24	your gold
JOB.22.24	among the rocks in the ravines – 
JOB.22.25	 then the Almighty himself will be your gold,
JOB.22.25	and the choicest
JOB.22.26	 Surely then you will delight yourself
JOB.22.26	and will lift up your face toward God.
JOB.22.27	 You will pray to him and he will hear you,
JOB.22.27	and you will fulfill your vows to him.
JOB.22.28	 Whatever you decide
JOB.22.28	it will be established for you,
JOB.22.28	and light will shine on your ways.
JOB.22.29	 When people are brought low
JOB.22.29	‘Lift them up!’
JOB.22.29	then he will save the downcast;
JOB.22.30	 he will deliver even someone who is not innocent,
JOB.22.30	who will escape
JOB.23.1	 Then Job answered:
JOB.23.2	 “Even today my complaint is still bitter;
JOB.23.2	his
JOB.23.3	 O that I knew
JOB.23.3	that I could come
JOB.23.4	 I would lay out my case
JOB.23.4	and fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	 I would know with what words
JOB.23.5	and understand what he would say to me.
JOB.23.6	 Would he contend
JOB.23.6	No, he would only pay attention to me.
JOB.23.7	 There
JOB.23.7	could present his case
JOB.23.7	and I would be delivered forever from my judge.
JOB.23.8	 “If I go to the east, he is not there,
JOB.23.8	and to the west, yet I do not perceive him.
JOB.23.9	 In the north
JOB.23.9	I do not see him;
JOB.23.9	when he turns
JOB.23.9	I see no trace of him.
JOB.23.10	 But he knows the pathway that I take;
JOB.23.10	if he tested me, I would come forth like gold.
JOB.23.11	 My feet
JOB.23.11	I have kept to his way and have not turned aside.
JOB.23.12	 I have not departed from the commands of his lips;
JOB.23.12	I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my allotted portion.
JOB.23.13	 But he is unchangeable,
JOB.23.13	Whatever he
JOB.23.14	 For he fulfills his decree against me,
JOB.23.14	and many such things are his plans.
JOB.23.15	 That is why I am terrified in his presence;
JOB.23.15	when I consider, I am afraid because of him.
JOB.23.16	 Indeed, God has made my heart faint;
JOB.23.16	the Almighty has terrified me.
JOB.23.17	 Yet I have not been silent because of the darkness,
JOB.23.17	because of the thick darkness 
JOB.23.17	that covered my face.
JOB.24.1	 “Why are times not appointed by
JOB.24.1	Why do those who know him not see his days?
JOB.24.2	 Men
JOB.24.2	they seize the flock and pasture them.
JOB.24.3	 They drive away the orphan’s donkey;
JOB.24.3	they take the widow’s ox as a pledge.
JOB.24.4	 They turn the needy from the pathway,
JOB.24.4	and the poor of the land hide themselves together.
JOB.24.5	 Like
JOB.24.5	they
JOB.24.5	seeking diligently for food;
JOB.24.5	the wasteland provides
JOB.24.5	and for their children.
JOB.24.6	 They reap fodder
JOB.24.6	and glean
JOB.24.7	 They spend the night naked because they lack clothing;
JOB.24.7	they have no covering against the cold.
JOB.24.8	 They are soaked by mountain rains
JOB.24.8	and huddle
JOB.24.9	 The fatherless child is snatched
JOB.24.9	the infant of the poor is taken as a pledge.
JOB.24.10	 They go about naked, without clothing,
JOB.24.10	and go hungry while they carry the sheaves.
JOB.24.11	 They press out the olive oil between the rows of olive trees;
JOB.24.11	they tread the winepresses while they are thirsty.
JOB.24.12	 From the city the dying
JOB.24.12	and the wounded
JOB.24.12	but God charges no one with wrongdoing.
JOB.24.13	 There are those
JOB.24.13	they do not know its ways 
JOB.24.13	and they do not stay on its paths.
JOB.24.14	 Before daybreak
JOB.24.14	he kills the poor and the needy;
JOB.24.14	in the night he is
JOB.24.15	 And the eye of the adulterer watches for the twilight,
JOB.24.15	thinking,
JOB.24.15	and covers his face with a mask.
JOB.24.16	 In the dark the robber
JOB.24.16	but by day they shut themselves in;
JOB.24.16	they do not know the light.
JOB.24.17	 For all of them,
JOB.24.17	like deep darkness;
JOB.24.17	they are friends with the terrors of darkness.
JOB.24.18	 “You say,
JOB.24.18	their portion of the land is cursed
JOB.24.18	so that no one goes to their vineyard.
JOB.24.19	 The drought as well as the heat carry away 
JOB.24.19	the melted snow;
JOB.24.19	so the grave
JOB.24.20	 The womb
JOB.24.20	the worm feasts on him,
JOB.24.20	no longer will he be remembered.
JOB.24.20	Like a tree, wickedness will be broken down.
JOB.24.21	 He preys on
JOB.24.21	and does not treat the widow well.
JOB.24.22	 But God
JOB.24.22	when God
JOB.24.23	 God
JOB.24.23	but he is constantly watching
JOB.24.24	 They are exalted for a little while,
JOB.24.24	and then they are gone,
JOB.24.24	they are brought low
JOB.24.24	and gathered in,
JOB.24.24	and like a head of grain they are cut off.’
JOB.24.25	 “If this is not so, who can prove me a liar
JOB.24.25	and reduce my words to nothing?”
JOB.25.1	 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
JOB.25.2	 “Dominion
JOB.25.2	he establishes peace in his heights.
JOB.25.3	 Can his armies be numbered?
JOB.25.3	On whom does his light
JOB.25.4	 How then can a human being be righteous before God?
JOB.25.4	How can one born of a woman be pure?
JOB.25.5	 If even the moon is not bright,
JOB.25.5	and the stars are not pure as far as he is concerned,
JOB.25.6	 how much less a mortal man, who is but a maggot
JOB.25.6	a son of man, who is only a worm!”
JOB.26.1	 Then Job replied:
JOB.26.2	 “How you have helped
JOB.26.2	How you have saved the person who has no strength!
JOB.26.3	 How you have advised the one without wisdom,
JOB.26.3	and abundantly
JOB.26.4	 To whom
JOB.26.4	And whose spirit has come forth from your mouth?
JOB.26.5	 “The dead
JOB.26.5	those beneath the waters 
JOB.26.5	and all that live in them.
JOB.26.6	 The underworld
JOB.26.6	the place of destruction lies uncovered.
JOB.26.7	 He spreads out the northern skies
JOB.26.7	he suspends the earth on nothing.
JOB.26.8	 He locks the waters in his clouds,
JOB.26.8	and the clouds do not burst with the weight of them.
JOB.26.9	 He conceals
JOB.26.9	shrouding it with his clouds.
JOB.26.10	 He marks out the horizon
JOB.26.10	as a boundary between light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	 The pillars
JOB.26.11	and are amazed at his rebuke.
JOB.26.12	 By his power he stills
JOB.26.12	by his wisdom he cut Rahab the great sea monster
JOB.26.13	 By his breath
JOB.26.13	his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
JOB.26.14	 Indeed, these are but the outer fringes of his ways!
JOB.26.14	How faint is the whisper
JOB.26.14	But who can understand the thunder of his power?”
JOB.27.1	 And Job took up his discourse again:
JOB.27.2	 “As surely as God lives,
JOB.27.2	the Almighty, who has made my life bitter
JOB.27.3	 for while
JOB.27.3	and the breath from God is in my nostrils,
JOB.27.4	 my
JOB.27.4	and my tongue will whisper
JOB.27.5	 I will never
JOB.27.5	until I die, I will not set aside my integrity!
JOB.27.6	 I will maintain my righteousness
JOB.27.6	and never let it go;
JOB.27.6	my conscience
JOB.27.6	for as long as I live.
JOB.27.7	 “May my enemy be like the wicked,
JOB.27.7	my adversary
JOB.27.8	 For what hope does the godless have when he is cut off,
JOB.27.8	when God takes away his life?
JOB.27.9	 Does God listen to his cry
JOB.27.9	when distress overtakes him?
JOB.27.10	 Will he find delight
JOB.27.10	Will he call out to God at all times?
JOB.27.11	 I will teach you
JOB.27.11	What is on the Almighty’s mind
JOB.27.12	 If you yourselves have all seen this,
JOB.27.12	Why in the world
JOB.27.13	 This is the portion of the wicked man 
JOB.27.13	allotted by God,
JOB.27.13	the inheritance that evildoers receive 
JOB.27.13	from the Almighty.
JOB.27.14	 If his children increase – it is for the sword!
JOB.27.14	His offspring never have enough to eat.
JOB.27.15	 Those who survive him are buried by the plague,
JOB.27.15	and their
JOB.27.16	 If he piles up silver like dust
JOB.27.16	and stores up clothing like mounds of clay,
JOB.27.17	 what he stores up
JOB.27.17	and an innocent man will inherit his silver.
JOB.27.18	 The house he builds is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon,
JOB.27.18	like a hut
JOB.27.19	 He goes to bed wealthy, but will do so no more.
JOB.27.19	When he opens his eyes, it is all gone.
JOB.27.20	 Terrors overwhelm him like a flood;
JOB.27.20	at night a whirlwind carries him off.
JOB.27.21	 The east wind carries him away, and he is gone;
JOB.27.21	it sweeps him out of his place.
JOB.27.22	 It hurls itself against him without pity
JOB.27.22	as he flees headlong from its power.
JOB.27.23	 It claps
JOB.27.23	and hisses him away from his place.
JOB.28.1	 “Surely
JOB.28.1	and a place where gold is refined.
JOB.28.2	 Iron is taken from the ground,
JOB.28.2	and rock is poured out
JOB.28.3	 Man puts an end to the darkness;
JOB.28.3	he searches the farthest recesses
JOB.28.3	for the ore in the deepest darkness.
JOB.28.4	 Far from where people live
JOB.28.4	in places travelers have long forgotten,
JOB.28.4	far from other people he dangles and sways.
JOB.28.5	 The earth, from which food comes,
JOB.28.5	is overturned below as though by fire;
JOB.28.6	 a place whose stones are sapphires
JOB.28.6	and which contains dust of gold;
JOB.28.7	 a hidden path
JOB.28.7	no falcon’s
JOB.28.8	 Proud beasts
JOB.28.8	and no lion has passed along it.
JOB.28.9	 On the flinty rock man has set to work
JOB.28.9	he has overturned mountains at their bases.
JOB.28.10	 He has cut out channels
JOB.28.10	his eyes have spotted
JOB.28.11	 He has searched
JOB.28.11	and what was hidden he has brought into the light.
JOB.28.12	 “But wisdom – where can it be found?
JOB.28.12	Where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.13	 Mankind does not know its place;
JOB.28.13	it cannot be found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	 The deep
JOB.28.14	And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’
JOB.28.15	 Fine gold cannot be given in exchange for it,
JOB.28.15	nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
JOB.28.16	 It cannot be measured out for purchase
JOB.28.16	with precious onyx
JOB.28.17	 Neither gold nor crystal
JOB.28.17	nor can a vase
JOB.28.18	 Of coral and jasper no mention will be made;
JOB.28.18	the price
JOB.28.19	 The topaz of Cush
JOB.28.19	it cannot be purchased with pure gold.
JOB.28.20	 “But wisdom – where does it come from?
JOB.28.20	Where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.21	 For
JOB.28.21	from the eyes of every living creature,
JOB.28.21	and from the birds of the sky it has been concealed.
JOB.28.22	 Destruction
JOB.28.22	‘With our ears we have heard a rumor about where it can be found.’
JOB.28.23	 God understands the way to it,
JOB.28.23	and he alone knows its place.
JOB.28.24	 For he looks to the ends of the earth
JOB.28.24	and observes everything under the heavens.
JOB.28.25	 When he made
JOB.28.25	and measured
JOB.28.26	 When he imposed a limit
JOB.28.26	and a path for the thunderstorm,
JOB.28.27	 then he looked at wisdom
JOB.28.27	he established
JOB.28.28	 And he said to mankind,
JOB.28.28	‘The fear of the
JOB.28.28	and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”
JOB.29.1	 Then Job continued
JOB.29.2	 “O that I could be
JOB.29.2	in the months now gone,
JOB.29.2	in the days
JOB.29.3	 when
JOB.29.3	to shine upon my head,
JOB.29.3	and by his light 
JOB.29.3	I walked
JOB.29.4	 just as I was in my most productive time,
JOB.29.4	when God’s intimate friendship
JOB.29.5	 when the Almighty
JOB.29.5	and my children were
JOB.29.6	 when my steps
JOB.29.6	and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil!
JOB.29.7	 When I went out to the city gate
JOB.29.7	and secured my seat in the public square,
JOB.29.8	 the young men would see me and step aside,
JOB.29.8	and the old men would get up and remain standing;
JOB.29.9	 the chief men refrained from talking
JOB.29.9	and covered their mouths with their hands;
JOB.29.10	 the voices of the nobles fell silent,
JOB.29.10	and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
JOB.29.11	 “As soon as the ear heard these things,
JOB.29.11	and when the eye saw them, it bore witness to me,
JOB.29.12	 for I rescued the poor who cried out for help,
JOB.29.12	and the orphan who
JOB.29.13	 the blessing of the dying man descended on me,
JOB.29.13	and I made the widow’s heart rejoice;
JOB.29.14	 I put on righteousness and it clothed me,
JOB.29.14	my just dealing
JOB.29.15	 I was eyes for the blind
JOB.29.15	and feet for the lame;
JOB.29.16	 I was a father
JOB.29.16	and I investigated the case of the person I did not know;
JOB.29.17	 I broke the fangs
JOB.29.17	and made him drop
JOB.29.18	 “Then I thought, ‘I will die in my own home,
JOB.29.18	my days as numerous as the grains of sand.
JOB.29.19	 My roots reach the water,
JOB.29.19	and the dew lies on my branches all night long.
JOB.29.20	 My glory
JOB.29.20	and my bow ever new in my hand.’
JOB.29.21	 “People
JOB.29.21	they kept silent for my advice.
JOB.29.22	 After I had spoken, they did not respond;
JOB.29.22	my words fell on them drop by drop.
JOB.29.23	 They waited for me as people wait
JOB.29.23	and they opened their mouths
JOB.29.23	as for
JOB.29.24	 If I smiled at them, they hardly believed it;
JOB.29.24	and they did not cause the light of my face to darken.
JOB.29.25	 I chose
JOB.29.25	and sat as their chief;
JOB.29.25	I lived like a king among his troops;
JOB.29.25	I was like one who comforts mourners.
JOB.30.1	 “But now they mock me, those who are younger
JOB.30.1	whose fathers I disdained too much
JOB.30.1	to put with my sheep dogs.
JOB.30.2	 Moreover, the strength of their
JOB.30.2	what use was it to me?
JOB.30.2	Men whose strength
JOB.30.3	 gaunt
JOB.30.3	they would gnaw
JOB.30.3	in former time desolate and waste.
JOB.30.4	 By the brush
JOB.30.4	and the root of the broom tree was their food.
JOB.30.5	 They were banished from the community
JOB.30.5	people
JOB.30.5	like they would shout at thieves
JOB.30.6	 so that they had to live
JOB.30.6	in the dry stream beds,
JOB.30.6	in the holes of the ground, and among the rocks.
JOB.30.7	 They brayed
JOB.30.7	and were huddled together
JOB.30.8	 Sons of senseless and nameless people,
JOB.30.8	they were driven out of the land with whips.
JOB.30.9	 “And now I have become their taunt song;
JOB.30.9	I have become a byword
JOB.30.10	 They detest me and maintain their distance;
JOB.30.10	they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	 Because God has untied
JOB.30.11	people throw off all restraint in my presence.
JOB.30.12	 On my right the young rabble
JOB.30.12	they drive me from place to place,
JOB.30.12	and build up siege ramps
JOB.30.13	 They destroy
JOB.30.13	they succeed in destroying me
JOB.30.13	without anyone assisting
JOB.30.14	 They come in as through a wide breach;
JOB.30.14	amid the crash
JOB.30.15	 Terrors are turned loose
JOB.30.15	they drive away
JOB.30.15	and like a cloud my deliverance has passed away.
JOB.30.16	 “And now my soul pours itself out within me;
JOB.30.16	days of suffering take hold of me.
JOB.30.17	 Night pierces
JOB.30.17	my gnawing pains
JOB.30.18	 With great power God
JOB.30.18	he binds me like the collar
JOB.30.19	 He has flung me into the mud,
JOB.30.19	and I have come to resemble dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	 I cry out to you,
JOB.30.20	I stand up,
JOB.30.21	 You have become cruel to me;
JOB.30.21	with the strength of your hand you attack me.
JOB.30.22	 You pick me up on the wind and make me ride on it;
JOB.30.22	you toss me about
JOB.30.23	 I know that you are bringing
JOB.30.23	to the meeting place for all the living.
JOB.30.24	 “Surely one does not stretch out his hand 
JOB.30.24	against a broken man
JOB.30.24	when he cries for help in his distress.
JOB.30.25	 Have I not wept for the unfortunate?
JOB.30.25	Was not my soul grieved for the poor?
JOB.30.26	 But when I hoped for good, trouble came;
JOB.30.26	when I expected light, then darkness came.
JOB.30.27	 My heart
JOB.30.27	the days of my affliction confront me.
JOB.30.28	 I go about blackened,
JOB.30.28	in the assembly I stand up and cry for help.
JOB.30.29	 I have become a brother to jackals
JOB.30.29	and a companion of ostriches.
JOB.30.30	 My skin has turned dark on me;
JOB.30.30	my body
JOB.30.31	 My harp is used for
JOB.30.31	and my flute for the sound of weeping.
JOB.31.1	 “I made a covenant with
JOB.31.1	how then could I entertain thoughts against a virgin?
JOB.31.2	 What then would be one’s lot from God above,
JOB.31.2	one’s heritage from the Almighty
JOB.31.3	 Is it not misfortune for the unjust,
JOB.31.3	and disaster for those who work iniquity?
JOB.31.4	 Does he not see my ways
JOB.31.4	and count all my steps?
JOB.31.5	 If
JOB.31.5	and if
JOB.31.6	 let him
JOB.31.6	then God will discover
JOB.31.7	 If my footsteps have strayed from the way,
JOB.31.7	if my heart has gone after my eyes,
JOB.31.7	or if anything
JOB.31.8	 then let me sow
JOB.31.8	and let my crops
JOB.31.9	 If my heart has been enticed by a woman,
JOB.31.9	and I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door,
JOB.31.10	 then let my wife turn the millstone
JOB.31.10	and may other men have sexual relations with her.
JOB.31.11	 For I would have committed
JOB.31.11	an iniquity to be judged.
JOB.31.12	 For it is a fire that devours even to Destruction,
JOB.31.12	and it would uproot
JOB.31.13	 “If I have disregarded the right of my male servants 
JOB.31.13	or my female servants
JOB.31.13	when they disputed
JOB.31.14	 then what will I do when God confronts me in judgment;
JOB.31.14	when he intervenes,
JOB.31.14	how will I respond to him?
JOB.31.15	 Did not the one who made me in the womb make them?
JOB.31.15	Did not the same one form us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	 If I have refused to give the poor what they desired,
JOB.31.16	or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
JOB.31.17	 If I ate my morsel of bread myself,
JOB.31.17	and did not share any of it with orphans
JOB.31.18	 but from my youth I raised the orphan
JOB.31.18	and from my mother’s womb
JOB.31.18	I guided the widow!
JOB.31.19	 If I have seen anyone about to perish for lack of clothing,
JOB.31.19	or a poor man without a coat,
JOB.31.20	 whose heart did not bless me
JOB.31.20	as he warmed himself with the fleece of my sheep,
JOB.31.21	 if I have raised my hand
JOB.31.21	when I saw my support in the court,
JOB.31.22	 then
JOB.31.22	let my arm be broken off at the socket.
JOB.31.23	 For the calamity from God was a terror to me,
JOB.31.23	and by reason of his majesty
JOB.31.24	 “If I have put my confidence in gold
JOB.31.24	or said to pure gold, 
JOB.31.24	‘You are my security!’
JOB.31.25	 if I have rejoiced because of the extent of my wealth,
JOB.31.25	or because of the great wealth my hand had gained,
JOB.31.26	 if I looked at the sun
JOB.31.26	and the moon advancing as a precious thing,
JOB.31.27	 so that my heart was secretly enticed,
JOB.31.27	and my hand threw them a kiss from my mouth,
JOB.31.28	 then this
JOB.31.28	for I would have been false
JOB.31.29	 If
JOB.31.29	or exulted
JOB.31.30	 I
JOB.31.30	by asking
JOB.31.31	 if
JOB.31.31	‘If only there were
JOB.31.31	who has not been satisfied from Job’s
JOB.31.32	 But
JOB.31.32	for I opened my doors to the traveler
JOB.31.33	 if
JOB.31.33	by hiding
JOB.31.34	 because I was terrified
JOB.31.34	and the contempt of families terrified me,
JOB.31.34	so that I remained silent
JOB.31.34	and would not go outdoors – 
JOB.31.35	 “If only I had
JOB.31.35	Here is my signature – 
JOB.31.35	let the Almighty answer me!
JOB.31.35	If only I had an indictment
JOB.31.35	that my accuser had written.
JOB.31.36	 Surely
JOB.31.36	I would bind
JOB.31.37	 I would give him an accounting of my steps;
JOB.31.37	like a prince I would approach him.
JOB.31.38	 “If my land cried out against me
JOB.31.38	and all its furrows wept together,
JOB.31.39	 if I have eaten its produce without paying,
JOB.31.39	or caused the death
JOB.31.40	 then let thorns sprout up in place of wheat,
JOB.31.40	and in place of barley, weeds!”
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	 So these three men refused to answer
JOB.32.2	 Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry.
JOB.32.3	 With Job’s
JOB.32.4	 Now Elihu had waited before speaking
JOB.32.5	 But when Elihu saw
JOB.32.6	 So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite spoke up:
JOB.32.6	“I am young,
JOB.32.6	that is why I was fearful,
JOB.32.6	and afraid to explain
JOB.32.7	 I said to myself, ‘Age
JOB.32.7	and length of years
JOB.32.8	 But it is a spirit in people,
JOB.32.8	the breath
JOB.32.8	that makes them understand.
JOB.32.9	 It is not the aged
JOB.32.9	nor old men who understand what is right.
JOB.32.10	 Therefore I say, ‘Listen
JOB.32.10	I, even I, will explain what I know.’
JOB.32.11	 Look, I waited for you to speak;
JOB.32.11	I listened closely to your wise thoughts,
JOB.32.12	 Now I was paying you close attention,
JOB.32.12	yet
JOB.32.12	not one of you was answering his statements!
JOB.32.13	 So do not say,
JOB.32.13	God will refute
JOB.32.14	 Job
JOB.32.14	and so I will not reply to him with your arguments.
JOB.32.15	 “They are dismayed
JOB.32.15	they have nothing left to say.
JOB.32.16	 And I have waited.
JOB.32.16	because they stand there and answer no more,
JOB.32.17	 I too will answer my part,
JOB.32.17	I too will explain what I know.
JOB.32.18	 For I am full of words,
JOB.32.18	and the spirit within me
JOB.32.19	 Inside I am like wine which has no outlet,
JOB.32.19	like new wineskins
JOB.32.20	 I will speak,
JOB.32.20	I will open my lips, so that I may answer.
JOB.32.21	 I will not show partiality to anyone,
JOB.32.21	nor will I confer a title
JOB.32.22	 for I do not know how to give honorary titles,
JOB.32.22	if I did,
JOB.33.1	 “But now, O Job, listen to my words,
JOB.33.1	and hear
JOB.33.2	 See now, I have opened
JOB.33.2	my tongue in my mouth has spoken.
JOB.33.3	 My words come from the uprightness of my heart,
JOB.33.3	and my lips will utter knowledge sincerely.
JOB.33.4	 The Spirit of God has made me,
JOB.33.4	and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
JOB.33.5	 Reply to me, if you can;
JOB.33.5	set your arguments
JOB.33.5	and take your stand!
JOB.33.6	 Look, I am just like you in relation to God;
JOB.33.6	I too have been molded
JOB.33.7	 Therefore no fear of me should terrify you,
JOB.33.7	nor should my pressure
JOB.33.8	 “Indeed, you have said in my hearing
JOB.33.8	(I heard the sound of the words!):
JOB.33.9	 ‘I am pure, without transgression;
JOB.33.9	I am clean
JOB.33.10	 Yet God
JOB.33.10	he regards me as his enemy!
JOB.33.11	 He puts my feet in shackles;
JOB.33.11	he watches closely all my paths.’
JOB.33.12	 Now in this, you are not right – I answer you,
JOB.33.12	for God is greater than a human being.
JOB.33.13	 Why do you contend against him,
JOB.33.13	that he does not answer all a person’s
JOB.33.14	 “For God speaks, the first time in one way,
JOB.33.14	the second time in another, 
JOB.33.14	though a person does not perceive
JOB.33.15	 In a dream, a night vision,
JOB.33.15	when deep sleep falls on people
JOB.33.15	as they sleep in their beds.
JOB.33.16	 Then he gives a revelation
JOB.33.16	and terrifies them with warnings,
JOB.33.17	 to turn a person from his sin,
JOB.33.17	and to cover a person’s pride.
JOB.33.18	 He spares a person’s life from corruption,
JOB.33.18	his very life from crossing over
JOB.33.19	 Or a person is chastened
JOB.33.19	and with the continual strife of his bones,
JOB.33.20	 so that his life loathes food,
JOB.33.20	and his soul rejects appetizing fare.
JOB.33.21	 His flesh wastes away from sight,
JOB.33.21	and his bones, which were not seen, 
JOB.33.21	are easily visible.
JOB.33.22	 He
JOB.33.22	and his life to the messengers of death.
JOB.33.23	 If there is an angel beside him,
JOB.33.23	one mediator
JOB.33.23	to tell a person what constitutes his uprightness;
JOB.33.24	 and if
JOB.33.24	‘Spare
JOB.33.24	to the place of corruption,
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom for him,’
JOB.33.25	 then his flesh is restored
JOB.33.25	he returns to the days of his youthful vigor.
JOB.33.26	 He entreats God, and God
JOB.33.26	he sees God’s face
JOB.33.26	and God
JOB.33.27	 That person sings
JOB.33.27	‘I have sinned and falsified what is right,
JOB.33.27	but I was not punished according to what I deserved.
JOB.33.28	 He redeemed my life
JOB.33.28	from going down to the place of corruption,
JOB.33.28	and my life sees the light!’
JOB.33.29	 “Indeed, God does all these things,
JOB.33.29	twice, three times, in his dealings
JOB.33.30	 to turn back his life from the place of corruption,
JOB.33.30	that he may be enlightened with the light of life.
JOB.33.31	 Pay attention, Job – listen to me;
JOB.33.31	be silent, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	 If you have any words,
JOB.33.32	speak, for I want to justify you.
JOB.33.33	 If not, you listen to me;
JOB.33.33	be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
JOB.34.1	 Elihu answered:
JOB.34.2	 “Listen to my words, you wise men;
JOB.34.2	hear
JOB.34.3	 For the ear assesses
JOB.34.3	as the mouth
JOB.34.4	 Let us evaluate
JOB.34.4	let us come to know among ourselves what is good.
JOB.34.5	 For Job says, ‘I am innocent,
JOB.34.5	but God turns away my right.
JOB.34.6	 Concerning my right, should I lie?
JOB.34.6	My wound
JOB.34.6	although I am without transgression.’
JOB.34.7	 What man is like Job,
JOB.34.7	who
JOB.34.8	 He goes about
JOB.34.8	he goes along
JOB.34.9	 For he says, ‘It does not profit a man
JOB.34.9	when he makes his delight with God.’
JOB.34.10	 “Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding.
JOB.34.10	Far be it from
JOB.34.10	from the Almighty to do evil.
JOB.34.11	 For he repays a person for his work,
JOB.34.11	and according to the conduct of a person,
JOB.34.11	he causes the consequences to find him.
JOB.34.12	 Indeed, in truth, God does not act wickedly,
JOB.34.12	and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
JOB.34.13	 Who entrusted
JOB.34.13	And who put him over
JOB.34.14	 If God
JOB.34.14	and gather in his spirit and his breath,
JOB.34.15	 all flesh would perish together
JOB.34.15	and human beings would return to dust.
JOB.34.16	 “If you have
JOB.34.16	hear what I have to say.
JOB.34.17	 Do you really think
JOB.34.17	that one who hates justice can govern?
JOB.34.17	And will you declare guilty 
JOB.34.17	the supremely righteous
JOB.34.18	 who says to a king,
JOB.34.18	and to nobles, ‘Wicked men,’
JOB.34.19	 who shows no partiality to princes,
JOB.34.19	and does not take note of
JOB.34.19	because all of them are the work of his hands?
JOB.34.20	 In a moment they die, in the middle of the night,
JOB.34.20	people
JOB.34.20	The mighty are removed effortlessly.
JOB.34.21	 For his eyes are on the ways of an individual,
JOB.34.21	he observes all a person’s
JOB.34.22	 There is no darkness, and no deep darkness,
JOB.34.22	where evildoers can hide themselves.
JOB.34.23	 For he does not still consider a person,
JOB.34.23	that he should come before God in judgment.
JOB.34.24	 He shatters the great without inquiry,
JOB.34.24	and sets up others in their place.
JOB.34.25	 Therefore, he knows their deeds,
JOB.34.25	he overthrows them
JOB.34.25	and they are crushed.
JOB.34.26	 He strikes them for their wickedness,
JOB.34.26	in a place where people can see,
JOB.34.27	 because they have turned away from following him,
JOB.34.27	and have not understood
JOB.34.28	 so that they caused
JOB.34.28	to come before him,
JOB.34.28	so that he hears
JOB.34.29	 But if God
JOB.34.29	If he hides his face, then who can see him?
JOB.34.29	Yet
JOB.34.30	 so that the godless man should not rule,
JOB.34.30	and not lay snares for the people.
JOB.34.31	 “Has anyone said to God,
JOB.34.31	‘I have endured chastisement,
JOB.34.31	but I will not act wrongly any more.
JOB.34.32	 Teach me what I cannot see.
JOB.34.32	If I have done evil, I will do so no more.’
JOB.34.33	 Is it your opinion
JOB.34.33	because you reject this?
JOB.34.33	But you must choose, and not I,
JOB.34.33	so tell us what you know.
JOB.34.34	 Men of understanding say to me – 
JOB.34.34	any wise man listening to me says – 
JOB.34.35	 that
JOB.34.35	and his words are without understanding.
JOB.34.36	 But
JOB.34.36	because his answers are like those of wicked men.
JOB.34.37	 For he adds transgression
JOB.34.37	in our midst he claps his hands,
JOB.34.37	and multiplies his words against God.”
JOB.35.1	 Then Elihu answered:
JOB.35.2	 “Do you think this to be
JOB.35.2	when
JOB.35.3	 But you say, ‘What will it profit you,’
JOB.35.3	and, ‘What do I gain by not sinning?’
JOB.35.4	 I
JOB.35.4	and to your friends with you.
JOB.35.5	 Gaze at the heavens and see;
JOB.35.5	consider the clouds, which are higher than you!
JOB.35.6	 If you sin, how does it affect God?
JOB.35.6	If your transgressions are many,
JOB.35.6	what does it do to him?
JOB.35.7	 If you are righteous, what do you give to God,
JOB.35.7	or what does he receive from your hand?
JOB.35.8	 Your wickedness affects only
JOB.35.8	and your righteousness only other people.
JOB.35.9	 “People
JOB.35.9	because of the excess of oppression;
JOB.35.9	they cry out for help
JOB.35.9	because of the power
JOB.35.10	 But no one says, ‘Where is God, my Creator,
JOB.35.10	who gives songs in the night,
JOB.35.11	 who teaches us
JOB.35.11	and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’
JOB.35.12	 Then
JOB.35.12	because of the arrogance of the wicked.
JOB.35.13	 Surely it is an empty cry
JOB.35.13	the Almighty does not take notice of it.
JOB.35.14	 How much less, then,
JOB.35.14	when you say that you do not perceive him,
JOB.35.14	that the case is before him 
JOB.35.14	and you are waiting for him!
JOB.35.15	 And further,
JOB.35.15	that his anger does not punish,
JOB.35.15	and that he does not know transgression!
JOB.35.16	 So Job opens his mouth to no purpose;
JOB.35.16	without knowledge he multiplies words.”
JOB.36.1	 Elihu said further:
JOB.36.2	 “Be patient
JOB.36.2	and I will instruct you,
JOB.36.2	for I still have words to speak on God’s behalf.
JOB.36.3	 With my knowledge I will speak comprehensively,
JOB.36.3	and to my Creator I will ascribe righteousness.
JOB.36.4	 For in truth, my words are not false;
JOB.36.4	it is one complete
JOB.36.4	who is with you.
JOB.36.5	 Indeed, God is mighty; and he does not despise people,
JOB.36.5	he
JOB.36.6	 He does not allow the wicked to live,
JOB.36.6	but he gives justice to the poor.
JOB.36.7	 He does not take his eyes
JOB.36.7	but with kings on the throne 
JOB.36.7	he seats the righteous
JOB.36.8	 But if they are bound in chains,
JOB.36.8	and held captive by the cords of affliction,
JOB.36.9	 then he reveals
JOB.36.9	and their transgressions, 
JOB.36.9	that they were behaving proudly.
JOB.36.10	 And he reveals
JOB.36.10	and says that they must turn
JOB.36.11	 If they obey and serve him,
JOB.36.11	they live out their days in prosperity
JOB.36.11	and their years in pleasantness.
JOB.36.12	 But if they refuse to listen,
JOB.36.12	they pass over the river of death,
JOB.36.12	and expire without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	 The godless at heart
JOB.36.13	they do not cry out even when he binds them.
JOB.36.14	 They die
JOB.36.14	and their life ends among the male cultic prostitutes.
JOB.36.15	 He delivers the afflicted by
JOB.36.15	he reveals himself to them
JOB.36.16	 And surely, he drew you
JOB.36.16	to a wide place, unrestricted,
JOB.36.16	and to the comfort
JOB.36.16	filled with rich food.
JOB.36.17	 But now you are preoccupied with the judgment due the wicked,
JOB.36.17	judgment and justice take hold of you.
JOB.36.18	 Be careful that
JOB.36.18	do not let a large bribe
JOB.36.19	 Would your wealth
JOB.36.19	so that you would not be in distress,
JOB.36.19	even all your mighty efforts?
JOB.36.20	 Do not long for the cover of night
JOB.36.20	to drag people away from their homes.
JOB.36.21	 Take heed, do not turn to evil,
JOB.36.21	for because of this you have been tested
JOB.36.22	 Indeed, God is exalted in his power;
JOB.36.22	who is a teacher
JOB.36.23	 Who has prescribed his ways for him?
JOB.36.23	Or said to him, ‘You have done what is wicked’?
JOB.36.24	 Remember to extol
JOB.36.24	which people have praised in song.
JOB.36.25	 All humanity has seen it;
JOB.36.25	people gaze on it from afar.
JOB.36.26	 “Yes, God is great – beyond our knowledge!
JOB.36.26	The number of his years is unsearchable.
JOB.36.27	 He draws up drops of water;
JOB.36.27	they distill
JOB.36.28	 which the clouds pour down
JOB.36.28	and shower on humankind abundantly.
JOB.36.29	 Who can understand the spreading of the clouds,
JOB.36.29	the thunderings of his pavilion?
JOB.36.30	 See how he scattered
JOB.36.30	he has covered the depths
JOB.36.31	 It is by these that he judges
JOB.36.31	and supplies food in abundance.
JOB.36.32	 With his hands
JOB.36.32	and directs it against its target.
JOB.36.33	 His thunder announces the coming storm,
JOB.36.33	the cattle also, concerning the storm’s approach.
JOB.37.1	 At this also my heart pounds
JOB.37.1	and leaps from its place.
JOB.37.2	 Listen carefully
JOB.37.2	to the rumbling
JOB.37.3	 Under the whole heaven he lets it go,
JOB.37.3	even his lightning to the far corners
JOB.37.4	 After that a voice roars;
JOB.37.4	he thunders with an exalted voice,
JOB.37.4	and he does not hold back his lightning bolts
JOB.37.4	when his voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	 God thunders with his voice in marvelous ways;
JOB.37.5	he does great things beyond our understanding.
JOB.37.6	 For to the snow he says, ‘Fall
JOB.37.6	and to the torrential rains,
JOB.37.7	 He causes everyone to stop working,
JOB.37.7	so that all people
JOB.37.8	 The wild animals go to their lairs,
JOB.37.8	and in their dens they remain.
JOB.37.9	 A tempest blows out from its chamber,
JOB.37.9	icy cold from the driving winds.
JOB.37.10	 The breath of God produces ice,
JOB.37.10	and the breadth of the waters freeze solid.
JOB.37.11	 He loads the clouds with moisture;
JOB.37.11	he scatters his lightning through the clouds.
JOB.37.12	 The clouds
JOB.37.12	wheeling about according to his plans,
JOB.37.12	to carry out
JOB.37.12	over the face of the whole inhabited world.
JOB.37.13	 Whether it is for punishment
JOB.37.13	or whether it is for mercy, 
JOB.37.13	he causes it to find its mark.
JOB.37.14	 “Pay attention to this, Job!
JOB.37.14	Stand still and consider the wonders God works.
JOB.37.15	 Do you know how God commands them,
JOB.37.15	how he makes lightning flash in his storm cloud?
JOB.37.16	 Do you know about the balancing
JOB.37.16	that wondrous activity of him who is perfect in knowledge?
JOB.37.17	 You, whose garments are hot
JOB.37.17	when the earth is still because of the south wind,
JOB.37.18	 will you, with him, spread out
JOB.37.18	solid as a mirror of molten metal?
JOB.37.19	 Tell us what we should
JOB.37.19	We cannot prepare a case
JOB.37.19	because of the darkness.
JOB.37.20	 Should he be informed that I want
JOB.37.20	If a man speaks, surely he would be swallowed up!
JOB.37.21	 But now, the sun
JOB.37.21	it is bright in the skies – 
JOB.37.21	after a wind passed and swept the clouds away.
JOB.37.22	 From the north he comes in golden splendor;
JOB.37.22	around God is awesome majesty.
JOB.37.23	 As for the Almighty,
JOB.37.23	He is great in power,
JOB.37.23	but justice
JOB.37.24	 Therefore people fear him,
JOB.37.24	for he does not regard all the wise in heart.”
JOB.38.1	 Then the 
JOB.38.2	 “Who is this
JOB.38.2	with words without knowledge?
JOB.38.3	 Get ready for a difficult task
JOB.38.3	I will question you
JOB.38.3	and you will inform me!
JOB.38.4	 “Where were you 
JOB.38.4	when I laid the foundation
JOB.38.4	Tell me,
JOB.38.5	 Who set its measurements – if
JOB.38.5	or who stretched a measuring line across it?
JOB.38.6	 On what
JOB.38.6	or who laid its cornerstone – 
JOB.38.7	 when the morning stars
JOB.38.7	and all the sons of God
JOB.38.8	 “Who shut up
JOB.38.8	when it burst forth,
JOB.38.9	 when I made
JOB.38.9	and thick darkness its swaddling band,
JOB.38.10	 when I prescribed
JOB.38.10	and set
JOB.38.11	 when I said, ‘To here you may come
JOB.38.11	and no farther,
JOB.38.11	here your proud waves will be confined’?
JOB.38.12	 Have you ever in your life
JOB.38.12	or made the dawn know
JOB.38.13	 that it might seize the corners of the earth,
JOB.38.13	and shake the wicked out of it?
JOB.38.14	 The earth takes shape like clay under a seal;
JOB.38.14	its features
JOB.38.15	 Then from the wicked the light is withheld,
JOB.38.15	and the arm raised in violence
JOB.38.16	 Have you gone to the springs that fill the sea,
JOB.38.16	or walked about in the recesses of the deep?
JOB.38.17	 Have the gates of death been revealed to you?
JOB.38.17	Have you seen the gates of deepest darkness?
JOB.38.18	 Have you considered the vast expanses of the earth?
JOB.38.18	Tell me, if you know it all!
JOB.38.19	 “In what direction
JOB.38.19	and darkness, where is its place,
JOB.38.20	 that you may take them to their borders
JOB.38.20	and perceive the pathways to their homes?
JOB.38.21	 You know, for you were born before them;
JOB.38.21	and the number of your days is great!
JOB.38.22	 Have you entered the storehouse
JOB.38.22	or seen the armory
JOB.38.23	 which I reserve for the time of trouble,
JOB.38.23	for the day of war and battle?
JOB.38.24	 In what direction is lightning
JOB.38.24	or the east winds scattered over the earth?
JOB.38.25	 Who carves out a channel for the heavy rains,
JOB.38.25	and a path for the rumble of thunder,
JOB.38.26	 to cause it to rain on an uninhabited land,
JOB.38.26	a desert where there are no human beings,
JOB.38.27	 to satisfy a devastated and desolate land,
JOB.38.27	and to cause it to sprout with vegetation?
JOB.38.28	 Does the rain have a father,
JOB.38.28	or who has fathered the drops of the dew?
JOB.38.29	 From whose womb does the ice emerge,
JOB.38.29	and the frost from the sky,
JOB.38.30	 when the waters become hard
JOB.38.30	when the surface of the deep is frozen solid?
JOB.38.31	 Can you tie the bands
JOB.38.31	or release the cords of Orion?
JOB.38.32	 Can you lead out 
JOB.38.32	the constellations
JOB.38.32	or guide the Bear with its cubs?
JOB.38.33	 Do you know the laws of the heavens,
JOB.38.33	or can you set up their rule over the earth?
JOB.38.34	 Can you raise your voice to the clouds
JOB.38.34	so that a flood of water covers you?
JOB.38.35	 Can you send out lightning bolts, and they go?
JOB.38.35	Will they say to you, ‘Here we are’?
JOB.38.36	 Who has put wisdom in the heart,
JOB.38.36	or has imparted understanding to the mind?
JOB.38.37	 Who by wisdom can count the clouds,
JOB.38.37	and who can tip over
JOB.38.38	 when the dust hardens
JOB.38.38	and the clumps of earth stick together?
JOB.38.39	 “Do you hunt prey for the lioness,
JOB.38.39	and satisfy the appetite
JOB.38.40	 when they crouch in their dens,
JOB.38.40	when they wait in ambush in the thicket?
JOB.38.41	 Who prepares prey for the raven,
JOB.38.41	when its young cry out to God
JOB.38.41	and wander about
JOB.39.1	 “Are you acquainted with the way
JOB.39.1	the mountain goats
JOB.39.1	Do you watch as the wild deer give birth to their young?
JOB.39.2	 Do you count the months they must fulfill,
JOB.39.2	and do you know the time they give birth?
JOB.39.3	 They crouch, they bear
JOB.39.3	they bring forth the offspring they have carried.
JOB.39.4	 Their young grow strong, and grow up in the open;
JOB.39.4	they go off, and do not return to them.
JOB.39.5	 Who let the wild donkey go free?
JOB.39.5	Who released the bonds of the donkey,
JOB.39.6	 to whom I appointed the steppe for its home,
JOB.39.6	the salt wastes as its dwelling place?
JOB.39.7	 It scorns the tumult in the town;
JOB.39.7	it does not hear the shouts of a driver.
JOB.39.8	 It ranges the hills as its pasture,
JOB.39.8	and searches after every green plant.
JOB.39.9	 Is the wild ox willing to be your servant?
JOB.39.9	Will it spend the night at your feeding trough?
JOB.39.10	 Can you bind the wild ox
JOB.39.10	will it till the valleys, following after you?
JOB.39.11	 Will you rely on it because its strength is great?
JOB.39.11	Will you commit
JOB.39.12	 Can you count on
JOB.39.12	and gather the grain
JOB.39.13	 “The wings of the ostrich
JOB.39.13	but are they the pinions and plumage of a stork?
JOB.39.14	 For she leaves
JOB.39.14	and lets them be warmed on the soil.
JOB.39.15	 She forgets that a foot might crush them,
JOB.39.15	or that a wild animal
JOB.39.16	 She is harsh
JOB.39.16	as if they were not hers;
JOB.39.16	she is unconcerned 
JOB.39.16	about the uselessness of her labor.
JOB.39.17	 For God deprived her of wisdom,
JOB.39.17	and did not impart understanding to her.
JOB.39.18	 But as soon as she springs up,
JOB.39.18	she laughs at the horse and its rider.
JOB.39.19	 “Do you give the horse its strength?
JOB.39.19	Do you clothe its neck with a mane?
JOB.39.20	 Do you make it leap
JOB.39.20	Its proud neighing
JOB.39.21	 It
JOB.39.21	exulting mightily,
JOB.39.21	it goes out to meet the weapons.
JOB.39.22	 It laughs at fear and is not dismayed;
JOB.39.22	it does not shy away from the sword.
JOB.39.23	 On it the quiver rattles;
JOB.39.23	the lance and javelin
JOB.39.24	 In excitement and impatience it consumes the ground;
JOB.39.24	it cannot stand still
JOB.39.25	 At the sound of the trumpet, it says, ‘Aha!’
JOB.39.25	And from a distance it catches the scent of battle,
JOB.39.25	the thunderous shouting of commanders, 
JOB.39.25	and the battle cries.
JOB.39.26	 “Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars,
JOB.39.26	and spreads its wings toward the south?
JOB.39.27	 Is it at your command
JOB.39.27	and builds its nest on high?
JOB.39.28	 It lives on a rock and spends the night there,
JOB.39.28	on a rocky crag
JOB.39.29	 From there it spots
JOB.39.29	its eyes gaze intently from a distance.
JOB.39.30	 And its young ones devour the blood,
JOB.39.30	and where the dead carcasses
JOB.39.30	there it is.”
JOB.40.1	 Then the 
JOB.40.2	 “Will the one who contends
JOB.40.2	Let the person who accuses God give him an answer!”
JOB.40.3	 Then Job answered the 
JOB.40.4	 “Indeed, I am completely unworthy
JOB.40.4	I put
JOB.40.5	 I have spoken once, but I cannot answer;
JOB.40.5	twice, but I will say no more.”
JOB.40.6	 Then the 
JOB.40.7	 “Get ready for a difficult task
JOB.40.7	I will question you and you will inform me!
JOB.40.8	 Would you indeed annul
JOB.40.8	Would you declare me guilty so that you might be right?
JOB.40.9	 Do you have an arm as powerful as God’s,
JOB.40.9	and can you thunder with a voice like his?
JOB.40.10	 Adorn yourself, then, with majesty and excellency,
JOB.40.10	and clothe yourself with glory and honor!
JOB.40.11	 Scatter abroad
JOB.40.11	Look at every proud man
JOB.40.12	 Look at every proud man and abase him;
JOB.40.12	crush the wicked on the spot!
JOB.40.13	 Hide them in the dust
JOB.40.13	imprison
JOB.40.14	 Then I myself will acknowledge
JOB.40.14	that your own right hand can save you.
JOB.40.15	 “Look now at Behemoth,
JOB.40.15	it eats grass like the ox.
JOB.40.16	 Look
JOB.40.16	and its power in the muscles of its belly.
JOB.40.17	 It makes its tail stiff
JOB.40.17	the sinews of its thighs are tightly wound.
JOB.40.18	 Its bones are tubes of bronze,
JOB.40.18	its limbs like bars of iron.
JOB.40.19	 It ranks first among the works of God,
JOB.40.19	the One who made it 
JOB.40.19	has furnished it with a sword.
JOB.40.20	 For the hills bring it food,
JOB.40.20	where all the wild animals play.
JOB.40.21	 Under the lotus trees it lies,
JOB.40.21	in the secrecy of the reeds and the marsh.
JOB.40.22	 The lotus trees conceal it in their
JOB.40.22	the poplars by the stream conceal it.
JOB.40.23	 If the river rages,
JOB.40.23	it is secure,
JOB.40.23	should surge up to its mouth.
JOB.40.24	 Can anyone catch it by its eyes,
JOB.40.24	or pierce its nose with a snare?
JOB.41.1	 (40:25)
JOB.41.1	and tie down
JOB.41.2	 Can you put a cord through its nose,
JOB.41.2	or pierce its jaw with a hook?
JOB.41.3	 Will it make numerous supplications to you,
JOB.41.3	will it speak to you with tender words?
JOB.41.4	 Will it make a pact
JOB.41.4	so you could take it
JOB.41.5	 Can you play
JOB.41.5	or tie it on a leash
JOB.41.6	 Will partners
JOB.41.6	Will they divide it up
JOB.41.7	 Can you fill its hide with harpoons
JOB.41.7	or its head with fishing spears?
JOB.41.8	 If you lay your hand on it,
JOB.41.8	you will remember
JOB.41.8	and you will never do it again!
JOB.41.9	he is laid low even at the sight of it.
JOB.41.10	 Is it not fierce
JOB.41.10	Who is he, then, who can stand before it?
JOB.41.11	 (Who has confronted
JOB.41.11	Everything under heaven belongs to me!)
JOB.41.12	 I will not keep silent about its limbs,
JOB.41.12	and the extent of its might, 
JOB.41.12	and the grace of its arrangement.
JOB.41.13	 Who can uncover its outer covering?
JOB.41.13	Who can penetrate to the inside of its armor?
JOB.41.14	 Who can open the doors of its mouth?
JOB.41.14	Its teeth all around are fearsome.
JOB.41.15	 Its back
JOB.41.15	shut up closely
JOB.41.16	 each one is so close to the next
JOB.41.16	that no air can come between them.
JOB.41.17	 They lock tightly together, one to the next;
JOB.41.17	they cling together and cannot be separated.
JOB.41.18	 Its snorting throws out flashes of light;
JOB.41.18	its eyes are like the red glow
JOB.41.19	 Out of its mouth go flames,
JOB.41.19	sparks of fire shoot forth!
JOB.41.20	 Smoke streams from its nostrils
JOB.41.20	as from a boiling pot over burning
JOB.41.21	 Its breath sets coals ablaze
JOB.41.21	and a flame shoots from its mouth.
JOB.41.22	 Strength lodges in its neck,
JOB.41.22	and despair
JOB.41.23	 The folds
JOB.41.23	they are firm on it, immovable.
JOB.41.24	 Its heart
JOB.41.24	hard as a lower millstone.
JOB.41.25	 When it rises up, the mighty are terrified,
JOB.41.25	at its thrashing about they withdraw.
JOB.41.26	 Whoever strikes it with a sword
JOB.41.26	will have no effect,
JOB.41.26	nor with the spear, arrow, or dart.
JOB.41.27	 It regards iron as straw
JOB.41.27	and bronze as rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	 Arrows
JOB.41.28	slingstones become like chaff to it.
JOB.41.29	 A club is counted
JOB.41.29	it laughs at the rattling of the lance.
JOB.41.30	 Its underparts
JOB.41.30	it leaves its mark in the mud 
JOB.41.30	like a threshing sledge.
JOB.41.31	 It makes the deep boil like a cauldron
JOB.41.31	and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment,
JOB.41.32	 It leaves a glistening wake behind it;
JOB.41.32	one would think the deep had a head of white hair.
JOB.41.33	 The likes of it is not on earth,
JOB.41.33	a creature
JOB.41.34	 It looks on every haughty being;
JOB.41.34	it is king over all that are proud.”
JOB.42.1	 Then Job answered the 
JOB.42.2	 “I know that you can do all things;
JOB.42.2	no purpose of yours can be thwarted;
JOB.42.3	 you asked,
JOB.42.3	‘Who is this who darkens counsel 
JOB.42.3	without knowledge?’
JOB.42.3	But
JOB.42.3	things too wonderful for me to know.
JOB.42.4	 You said,
JOB.42.4	‘Pay attention, and I will speak;
JOB.42.4	I will question you, and you will answer me.’
JOB.42.5	 I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,
JOB.42.5	but now my eye has seen you.
JOB.42.6	 Therefore I despise myself,
JOB.42.6	and I repent in dust and ashes!
JOB.42.7	 After the 
JOB.42.8	 So now take
JOB.42.9	 So they went, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and did just as the 
JOB.42.10	 So the 
JOB.42.11	 So they came to him, all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they dined
JOB.42.12	 So the 
JOB.42.13	 And he also had seven sons
JOB.42.14	 The first daughter he named Jemimah,
JOB.42.15	 Nowhere in all the land could women be found who were as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance alongside their brothers.
JOB.42.16	 After this Job lived 140 years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. 
JOB.42.17	 And so Job died, old and full of days.
PSA.1.1	 How blessed
PSA.1.1	or stand in the pathway
PSA.1.1	or sit in the assembly
PSA.1.2	 Instead
PSA.1.2	he meditates on
PSA.1.3	 He is like
PSA.1.3	it
PSA.1.3	and its leaves never fall off.
PSA.1.3	He succeeds in everything he attempts.
PSA.1.4	 Not so with the wicked!
PSA.1.4	Instead
PSA.1.5	 For this reason
PSA.1.5	nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.
PSA.1.6	 Certainly
PSA.1.6	but the way of the wicked ends in destruction.
PSA.2.1	 Why
PSA.2.1	Why
PSA.2.2	 The kings of the earth
PSA.2.2	the rulers collaborate
PSA.2.2	against the 
PSA.2.3	 They say,
PSA.2.3	Let’s free ourselves from
PSA.2.4	 The one enthroned
PSA.2.4	the Lord taunts
PSA.2.5	 Then he angrily speaks to them
PSA.2.5	and terrifies them in his rage,
PSA.2.6	 “I myself
PSA.2.6	on Zion, my holy hill.”
PSA.2.7	 The king says,
PSA.2.7	‘You are my son!
PSA.2.8	 Ask me,
PSA.2.8	and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,
PSA.2.8	the ends of the earth as your personal property.
PSA.2.9	 You will break them
PSA.2.9	you will smash them like a potter’s jar!’”
PSA.2.10	 So now, you kings, do what is wise;
PSA.2.10	you rulers of the earth, submit to correction!
PSA.2.11	 Serve
PSA.2.11	Repent in terror!
PSA.2.12	 Give sincere homage!
PSA.2.12	Otherwise he
PSA.2.12	and you will die because of your behavior,
PSA.2.12	when his anger quickly ignites.
PSA.2.12	How blessed
PSA.3.1	Many attack me.
PSA.3.2	 Many say about me,
PSA.3.2	“God will not deliver him.”
PSA.3.3	 But you, 
PSA.3.3	you are my glory
PSA.3.4	 To the

PSA.3.5	 I rested and slept;
PSA.3.5	I awoke,
PSA.3.6	 I am not afraid
PSA.3.6	who attack me from all directions.
PSA.3.7	 Rise up,
PSA.3.7	Deliver me, my God!
PSA.3.7	Yes,
PSA.3.7	you will break the teeth
PSA.3.8	 The 
PSA.3.8	you show favor to your people.

PSA.4.1	Have mercy on me
PSA.4.2	 You men,
PSA.4.2	How long
PSA.4.2	and search for what is deceptive?
PSA.4.3	 Realize that
PSA.4.3	the 
PSA.4.4	 Tremble with fear and do not sin!
PSA.4.4	Meditate as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways!
PSA.4.5	 Offer the prescribed sacrifices
PSA.4.5	and trust in the 
PSA.4.6	 Many say, “Who can show us anything good?”
PSA.4.6	Smile upon us, 
PSA.4.7	 You make me happier
PSA.4.7	than those who have abundant grain and wine.
PSA.4.8	 I will lie down and sleep peacefully,
PSA.4.8	for you, 
PSA.5.1	 Listen to what I say,
PSA.5.1	Carefully consider my complaint!
PSA.5.2	 Pay attention to my cry for help,
PSA.5.2	my king and my God,
PSA.5.2	for I am praying to you!
PSA.5.3	in the morning I will present my case to you
PSA.5.4	 Certainly
PSA.5.4	evil people
PSA.5.5	 Arrogant people cannot stand in your presence;
PSA.5.5	you hate
PSA.5.6	 You destroy
PSA.5.6	the 
PSA.5.7	 But as for me,
PSA.5.7	I will bow down toward your holy temple as I worship you.
PSA.5.8	because of those who wait to ambush me,
PSA.5.8	remove the obstacles in the way in which you are guiding me!
PSA.5.9	 For
PSA.5.9	their stomachs are like the place of destruction,
PSA.5.9	their throats like an open grave,
PSA.5.9	their tongues like a steep slope leading into it.
PSA.5.10	 Condemn them,
PSA.5.10	May their own schemes be their downfall!
PSA.5.10	Drive them away
PSA.5.10	for they have rebelled against you.
PSA.5.11	 But may all who take shelter
PSA.5.11	May they continually
PSA.5.11	Shelter them

PSA.5.12	Like a shield you protect
PSA.6.1	Do not discipline me in your raging fury!
PSA.6.2	 Have mercy on me,
PSA.6.2	Heal me, 
PSA.6.3	 I am absolutely terrified,
PSA.6.3	and you, 
PSA.6.4	 Relent, 
PSA.6.4	Deliver me because of your faithfulness!
PSA.6.5	 For no one remembers you in the realm of death,
PSA.6.5	In Sheol who gives you thanks?
PSA.6.6	 I am exhausted as I groan;
PSA.6.6	all night long I drench my bed in tears;
PSA.6.6	my tears saturate the cushion beneath me.
PSA.6.7	 My eyes
PSA.6.7	they grow weak
PSA.6.8	 Turn back from me, all you who behave wickedly,
PSA.6.8	for the 
PSA.6.9	 The

PSA.7.1	 O 
PSA.7.1	Deliver me from all who chase me! Rescue me!
PSA.7.2	 Otherwise they will rip
PSA.7.2	they will tear me to bits and no one will be able to rescue me.
PSA.7.3	 O 
PSA.7.3	or am guilty of unjust actions,
PSA.7.4	 or have wronged my ally,
PSA.7.4	or helped his lawless enemy,
PSA.7.5	 may an enemy relentlessly chase
PSA.7.5	may he trample me to death
PSA.7.5	and leave me lying dishonored in the dust.
PSA.7.6	 Stand up angrily,
PSA.7.6	Rise up with raging fury against my enemies!
PSA.7.6	Wake up for my sake and execute the judgment you have decreed for them!
PSA.7.7	 The countries are assembled all around you;

PSA.7.11	 God is a just judge;
PSA.7.11	he is angry throughout the day.
PSA.7.12	 If a person
PSA.7.12	and prepares to shoot his bow.
PSA.7.13	 He prepares to use deadly weapons against him;
PSA.7.13	he gets ready to shoot flaming arrows.
PSA.7.14	 See the one who is pregnant with wickedness,
PSA.7.14	who conceives destructive plans,
PSA.7.14	and gives birth to harmful lies – 
PSA.7.15	 he digs a pit
PSA.7.15	and then falls into the hole he has made.
PSA.7.16	 He becomes the victim of his own destructive plans
PSA.7.16	and the violence he intended for others falls on his own head.
PSA.7.17	 I will thank the 
PSA.7.17	I will sing praises to the sovereign

PSA.8.2	you have ordained praise on account of your adversaries,
PSA.8.2	so that you might put an end to the vindictive enemy.
PSA.8.3	 When I look up at the heavens, which your fingers made,
PSA.8.3	and see the moon and the stars, which you set in place,
PSA.8.4	 Of what importance is the human race,
PSA.8.4	Of what importance is mankind,
PSA.8.5	 and make them a little less than the heavenly beings?
PSA.8.5	You grant mankind
PSA.8.6	 you appoint them to rule over your creation;
PSA.8.6	you have placed
PSA.8.7	 including all the sheep and cattle,
PSA.8.7	as well as the wild animals,

PSA.9.3	they trip and are defeated
PSA.9.4	 For you defended my just cause;
PSA.9.4	from your throne you pronounced a just decision.
PSA.9.5	 You terrified the nations with your battle cry;
PSA.9.5	you destroyed the wicked;
PSA.9.5	you permanently wiped out all memory of them.
PSA.9.6	 The enemy’s cities have been reduced to permanent ruins;
PSA.9.6	you destroyed their cities;
PSA.9.6	all memory of the enemies has perished.
PSA.9.7	 But the 
PSA.9.7	he reigns in a just manner.
PSA.9.8	 He judges the world fairly;
PSA.9.8	he makes just legal decisions for the nations.
PSA.9.9	 Consequently

PSA.9.10	for you, 
PSA.9.11	 Sing praises to the

PSA.9.12	 For the one who takes revenge against murderers took notice of the oppressed;
PSA.9.12	he did not overlook
PSA.9.13	 when they prayed:
PSA.9.13	“Have mercy on me,
PSA.9.13	See how I am oppressed by those who hate me,
PSA.9.13	O one who can snatch me away
PSA.9.14	 Then I will
PSA.9.14	in the gates of Daughter Zion
PSA.9.15	 The nations fell
PSA.9.15	their feet were caught in the net they had hidden.
PSA.9.16	 The 
PSA.9.16	he accomplished justice;
PSA.9.16	the wicked were ensnared by their own actions.
PSA.9.17	 The wicked are turned back and sent to Sheol;
PSA.9.17	this is the destiny of
PSA.9.18	 for the needy are not permanently ignored,
PSA.9.18	the hopes of the oppressed are not forever dashed.
PSA.9.19	 Rise up, 
PSA.9.19	Don’t let men be defiant!
PSA.9.19	May the nations be judged in your presence!
PSA.9.20	 Terrify them, 
PSA.9.20	Let the nations know they are mere mortals!
PSA.10.1	 Why, 
PSA.10.1	Why do you pay no attention during times of trouble?
PSA.10.2	 The wicked arrogantly chase the oppressed;
PSA.10.2	the oppressed are trapped
PSA.10.3	 Yes,
PSA.10.3	the one who robs others
PSA.10.4	 The wicked man is so arrogant he always thinks,
PSA.10.4	“God won’t hold me accountable; he doesn’t care.”
PSA.10.5	 He is secure at all times.
PSA.10.5	He has no regard for your commands;
PSA.10.5	he disdains all his enemies.
PSA.10.6	 He says to himself,
PSA.10.6	“I will never
PSA.10.6	because I experience no calamity.”
PSA.10.7	 His mouth is full of curses and deceptive, harmful words;
PSA.10.7	his tongue injures and destroys.
PSA.10.8	 He waits in ambush near the villages;
PSA.10.8	in hidden places he kills the innocent.
PSA.10.8	His eyes look for some unfortunate victim.
PSA.10.9	 He lies in ambush in a hidden place, like a lion in a thicket;
PSA.10.9	he lies in ambush, waiting to catch
PSA.10.9	he catches the oppressed
PSA.10.10	 His victims are crushed and beaten down;
PSA.10.10	they are trapped in his sturdy nets.
PSA.10.11	 He says to himself,
PSA.10.11	“God overlooks it;
PSA.10.11	he does not pay attention;
PSA.10.11	he never notices.”
PSA.10.12	 Rise up, 
PSA.10.12	O God, strike him down!
PSA.10.12	Do not forget the oppressed!
PSA.10.13	 Why does the wicked man reject God?
PSA.10.13	He says to himself,
PSA.10.14	 You have taken notice,
PSA.10.14	for
PSA.10.14	The unfortunate victim entrusts his cause to you;
PSA.10.14	you deliver
PSA.10.15	 Break the arm
PSA.10.15	Hold him accountable for his wicked deeds,
PSA.10.15	which he thought you would not discover.
PSA.10.16	 The 
PSA.10.16	The nations are driven out of his land.
PSA.10.17	you make them feel secure because you listen to their prayer.
PSA.10.18	 You defend
PSA.10.18	so that mere mortals may no longer terrorize them.
PSA.11.1	 In the 
PSA.11.1	How can you say to me,
PSA.11.1	“Flee to a mountain like a bird!

PSA.11.6	A whirlwind is what they deserve!
PSA.11.7	 Certainly
PSA.11.7	he rewards godly deeds;
PSA.11.7	the upright will experience his favor.
PSA.12.1	 Deliver, 
PSA.12.1	For the godly
PSA.12.1	people of integrity
PSA.12.2	 People lie to one another;
PSA.12.2	they flatter and deceive.
PSA.12.3	 May the 
PSA.12.3	and the tongue that boasts!
PSA.12.4	 They say,
PSA.12.4	we know how to flatter and boast.
PSA.12.4	Who is our master?”
PSA.12.5	 “Because of the violence done to the oppressed,
PSA.12.5	because of the painful cries
PSA.12.5	I will spring into action,”
PSA.12.5	“I will provide the safety they so desperately desire.”
PSA.12.6	 The 
PSA.12.6	They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the ground,
PSA.12.6	where it is thoroughly refined.
PSA.12.7	 You, 
PSA.12.7	you will continually shelter each one from these evil people,
PSA.12.8	 for the wicked seem to be everywhere,
PSA.12.8	when people promote evil.
PSA.13.1	 How long, 
PSA.13.1	How long will you pay no attention to me?
PSA.13.2	 How long must I worry,
PSA.13.2	and suffer in broad daylight?
PSA.13.2	How long will my enemy gloat over me?
PSA.13.3	 Look at me!
PSA.13.3	Revive me,
PSA.13.4	 Then
PSA.13.4	Then
PSA.13.5	 But I
PSA.13.5	May I rejoice because of your deliverance!
PSA.13.6	 I will sing praises
PSA.13.6	when he vindicates me.
PSA.14.1	 Fools say to themselves,
PSA.14.1	They sin and commit evil deeds;
PSA.14.1	none of them does what is right.
PSA.14.2	 The 
PSA.14.2	to see if there is anyone who is wise
PSA.14.3	 Everyone rejects God;
PSA.14.3	they are all morally corrupt.
PSA.14.3	None of them does what is right,
PSA.14.3	not even one!
PSA.14.4	 All those who behave wickedly
PSA.14.4	those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,
PSA.14.4	and do not call out to the 
PSA.14.5	 They are absolutely terrified,
PSA.14.5	for God defends the godly.
PSA.14.6	 You want to humiliate the oppressed,
PSA.14.6	even though
PSA.14.7	 I wish the deliverance
PSA.14.7	When the 
PSA.14.7	may Jacob rejoice,
PSA.14.7	may Israel be happy!

PSA.16.4	nor will I make vows in the name of their gods.
PSA.16.5	you make my future secure.
PSA.16.6	 It is as if I have been given fertile fields
PSA.16.6	or received a beautiful tract of land.

PSA.17.2	Decide what is right!
PSA.17.3	 You have scrutinized my inner motives;
PSA.17.3	you have examined me during the night.
PSA.17.3	You have carefully evaluated me, but you find no sin.
PSA.17.3	I am determined I will say nothing sinful.
PSA.17.4	 As for the actions of people
PSA.17.4	just as you have commanded,
PSA.17.4	I have not followed in the footsteps of violent men.
PSA.17.5	 I carefully obey your commands;
PSA.17.5	I do not deviate from them.
PSA.17.6	 I call to you for you will answer me, O God.

PSA.17.14	and leave their wealth to their offspring.

PSA.18.1	“I love
PSA.18.2	 The 
PSA.18.2	My God is my rocky summit where
PSA.18.2	my shield, the horn that saves me,

PSA.18.4	 The waves
PSA.18.4	the currents
PSA.18.5	 The ropes of Sheol tightened around me,
PSA.18.5	the snares of death trapped me.
PSA.18.6	 In my distress I called to the 
PSA.18.6	I cried out to my God.
PSA.18.6	From his heavenly temple
PSA.18.6	he listened to my cry for help.
PSA.18.7	 The earth heaved and shook;
PSA.18.7	the roots of the mountains
PSA.18.7	they heaved because he was angry.
PSA.18.8	 Smoke ascended from
PSA.18.8	fire devoured as it came from his mouth;
PSA.18.8	he hurled down fiery coals.
PSA.18.9	 He made the sky sink
PSA.18.9	a thick cloud was under his feet.
PSA.18.10	 He mounted
PSA.18.10	he glided
PSA.18.11	 He shrouded himself in darkness,
PSA.18.11	in thick rain clouds.
PSA.18.12	 From the brightness in front of him came
PSA.18.12	hail and fiery coals.
PSA.18.13	 The 
PSA.18.13	the sovereign One

PSA.18.17	 He rescued me from my strong enemy,
PSA.18.17	from those who hate me,
PSA.18.17	for they were too strong for me.
PSA.18.18	 They confronted
PSA.18.18	but the 
PSA.18.19	 He brought me out into a wide open place;
PSA.18.19	he delivered me because he was pleased with me.
PSA.18.20	 The 
PSA.18.20	he rewarded
PSA.18.21	 For I have obeyed the 
PSA.18.21	I have not rebelled against my God.
PSA.18.22	 For I am aware of all his regulations,
PSA.18.22	and I do not reject his rules.

PSA.34.12	Would you love to live a long, happy life?
PSA.34.13	 Then make sure you don’t speak evil words
PSA.34.13	or use deceptive speech!
PSA.34.14	 Turn away from evil and do what is right!
PSA.34.14	Strive for peace and promote it!
PSA.34.15	 The 
PSA.34.15	and hears their cry for help.
PSA.34.16	 But the 
PSA.34.16	and wipes out all memory of them from the earth.
PSA.34.17	 The godly
PSA.34.17	he saves them from all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	 The 
PSA.34.18	he delivers
PSA.34.19	 The godly
PSA.34.19	but the 
PSA.34.20	 He protects
PSA.34.20	not one of them is broken.
PSA.34.21	 Evil people self-destruct;
PSA.34.21	those who hate the godly are punished.
PSA.34.22	 The 
PSA.34.22	all who take shelter in him escape punishment.
PSA.35.1	 O 
PSA.35.1	Attack those who attack me!
PSA.35.2	 Grab your small shield and large shield,
PSA.35.2	and rise up to help me!
PSA.35.3	 Use your spear and lance
PSA.35.3	Assure me with these words:
PSA.35.4	 May those who seek my life be embarrassed and humiliated!
PSA.35.4	May those who plan to harm me be turned back and ashamed!
PSA.35.5	 May they be
PSA.35.5	as the 
PSA.35.6	 May their path be
PSA.35.6	as the 
PSA.35.7	 I did not harm them, but they hid a net to catch me
PSA.35.7	and dug a pit to trap me.
PSA.35.8	 Let destruction take them by surprise!
PSA.35.8	Let the net they hid catch them!
PSA.35.8	Let them fall into destruction!
PSA.35.9	 Then I will rejoice in the 
PSA.35.9	and be happy because of his deliverance.
PSA.35.10	 With all my strength I will say,
PSA.35.10	“O 
PSA.35.10	You rescue
PSA.35.10	the oppressed and needy from those who try to rob them.”
PSA.35.11	 Violent men perjure themselves,
PSA.35.11	and falsely accuse me.
PSA.35.12	 They repay me evil for the good I have done;
PSA.35.12	I am overwhelmed with sorrow.
PSA.35.13	 When they were sick, I wore sackcloth,
PSA.35.13	and refrained from eating food.
PSA.35.13	(If I am lying, may my prayers go unanswered!)
PSA.35.14	 I mourned for them as I would for a friend or my brother.
PSA.35.14	I bowed down
PSA.35.15	 But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together;
PSA.35.15	they gathered together to ambush me.
PSA.35.15	They tore at me without stopping to rest.
PSA.35.16	 When I tripped, they taunted me relentlessly,
PSA.35.16	and tried to bite me.
PSA.35.17	 O Lord, how long are you going to just stand there and watch this?
PSA.35.17	Rescue
PSA.35.17	guard my life
PSA.35.18	 Then I will give you thanks in the great assembly;
PSA.35.18	I will praise you before a large crowd of people!
PSA.35.19	 Do not let those who are my enemies for no reason
PSA.35.19	Do not let those who hate me without cause carry out their wicked schemes!
PSA.35.20	 For they do not try to make peace with others,
PSA.35.20	but plan ways to deceive those who are unsuspecting.
PSA.35.21	 They are ready to devour me;
PSA.35.21	they say, “Aha! Aha! We’ve got you!”
PSA.35.22	 But you take notice,
PSA.35.22	O Lord, do not remain far away from me!
PSA.35.23	 Rouse yourself, wake up
PSA.35.23	My God and Lord, defend my just cause!
PSA.35.24	 Vindicate me by your justice, O 
PSA.35.24	Do not let them gloat
PSA.35.25	 Do not let them say to themselves,
PSA.35.25	Do not let them say, “We have devoured him!”
PSA.35.26	 May those who want to harm me be totally embarrassed and ashamed!
PSA.35.26	May those who arrogantly taunt me be covered with shame and humiliation!
PSA.35.27	 May those who desire my vindication shout for joy and rejoice!
PSA.35.27	May they continually say,
PSA.35.28	 Then I will tell others about your justice,
PSA.35.28	and praise you all day long.
PSA.36.1	 An evil man is rebellious to the core.
PSA.36.1	He does not fear God,
PSA.36.2	 for he is too proud
PSA.36.2	to recognize and give up his sin.
PSA.36.3	 The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful;
PSA.36.3	he does not care about doing what is wise and right.
PSA.36.4	 He plans ways to sin while he lies in bed;
PSA.36.4	he is committed to a sinful lifestyle;
PSA.36.4	he does not reject what is evil.
PSA.36.5	 O 
PSA.36.5	your faithfulness to the clouds.
PSA.36.6	 Your justice is like the highest mountains,
PSA.36.6	your fairness like the deepest sea;
PSA.36.6	you preserve
PSA.36.7	 How precious
PSA.36.7	The human race finds shelter under your wings.
PSA.36.8	 They are filled with food from your house,
PSA.36.8	and you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies.
PSA.36.9	 For you are the one who gives
PSA.36.9	and sustains life.
PSA.36.10	 Extend
PSA.36.10	and vindicate
PSA.36.11	 Do not let arrogant men overtake me,
PSA.36.11	or let evil men make me homeless!
PSA.36.12	 I can see the evildoers! They have fallen!
PSA.36.12	They have been knocked down and are unable to get up!
PSA.37.1	 Do not fret
PSA.37.1	Do not envy evildoers!
PSA.37.2	 For they will quickly dry up like grass,
PSA.37.2	and wither away like plants.
PSA.37.3	 Trust in the 
PSA.37.3	Settle in the land and maintain your integrity!
PSA.37.4	 Then you will take delight in the 
PSA.37.4	and he will answer your prayers.
PSA.37.5	 Commit your future to the 
PSA.37.5	Trust in him, and he will act on your behalf.
PSA.37.6	 He will vindicate you in broad daylight,
PSA.37.6	and publicly defend your just cause.
PSA.37.7	 Wait patiently for the 
PSA.37.7	Wait confidently
PSA.37.7	Do not fret over the apparent success of a sinner,
PSA.37.7	a man who carries out wicked schemes!
PSA.37.8	 Do not be angry and frustrated!
PSA.37.8	Do not fret! That only leads to trouble!
PSA.37.9	 Wicked men
PSA.37.9	but those who rely on the 
PSA.37.10	 Evil men will soon disappear;
PSA.37.10	you will stare at the spot where they once were, but they will be gone.
PSA.37.11	 But the oppressed will possess the land
PSA.37.11	and enjoy great prosperity.
PSA.37.12	 Evil men plot against the godly
PSA.37.12	and viciously attack them.
PSA.37.13	 The Lord laughs in disgust
PSA.37.13	for he knows that their day is coming.
PSA.37.14	 Evil men draw their swords
PSA.37.14	and prepare their bows,
PSA.37.14	to bring down
PSA.37.14	and to slaughter those who are godly.
PSA.37.15	 Their swords will pierce
PSA.37.15	and their bows will be broken.
PSA.37.16	 The little bit that a godly man owns is better than
PSA.37.16	the wealth of many evil men,
PSA.37.17	 for evil men will lose their power,
PSA.37.17	but the 
PSA.37.18	 The 
PSA.37.18	and they possess a permanent inheritance.
PSA.37.19	 They will not be ashamed when hard times come;
PSA.37.19	when famine comes they will have enough to eat.
PSA.37.20	 But
PSA.37.20	the 
PSA.37.20	they will go up in smoke.
PSA.37.21	 Evil men borrow, but do not repay their debt,
PSA.37.21	but the godly show compassion and are generous.
PSA.37.22	 Surely
PSA.37.22	but those rejected
PSA.37.23	 The 
PSA.37.23	whose behavior he finds commendable.
PSA.37.24	 Even if
PSA.37.24	for the 
PSA.37.25	 I was once young, now I am old.
PSA.37.25	I have never seen a godly man abandoned,
PSA.37.25	or his children
PSA.37.26	 All day long he shows compassion and lends to others,
PSA.37.26	and his children
PSA.37.27	 Turn away from evil! Do what is right!
PSA.37.27	Then you will enjoy lasting security.
PSA.37.28	 For the 
PSA.37.28	and never abandons
PSA.37.28	They are permanently secure,
PSA.37.28	but the children
PSA.37.29	 The godly will possess the land
PSA.37.29	and will dwell in it permanently.
PSA.37.30	 The godly speak wise words
PSA.37.30	and promote justice.
PSA.37.31	 The law of their God controls their thinking;
PSA.37.31	their
PSA.37.32	 Evil men set an ambush for the godly
PSA.37.32	and try to kill them.
PSA.37.33	 But the 
PSA.37.33	or allow them to be condemned in a court of law.
PSA.37.34	 Rely
PSA.37.34	Then he will permit you
PSA.37.34	you will see the demise of evil men.
PSA.37.35	 I have seen ruthless evil men
PSA.37.35	growing in influence, like a green tree grows in its native soil.
PSA.37.36	 But then one passes by, and suddenly they have disappeared!
PSA.37.36	I looked for them, but they could not be found.
PSA.37.37	 Take note of the one who has integrity! Observe the godly!
PSA.37.37	For the one who promotes peace has a future.
PSA.37.38	 Sinful rebels are totally destroyed;
PSA.37.38	evil men have no future.
PSA.37.39	 But the 
PSA.37.39	he protects them in times of trouble.
PSA.37.40	 The 
PSA.37.40	he rescues them from evil men and delivers them,
PSA.37.40	for they seek his protection.
PSA.38.1	 O 
PSA.38.1	Do not continue to punish me in your raging fury!
PSA.38.2	 For your arrows pierce
PSA.38.2	and your hand presses me down.
PSA.38.3	 My whole body is sick because of your judgment;
PSA.38.3	I am deprived of health because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	 For my sins overwhelm me;
PSA.38.4	like a heavy load, they are too much for me to bear.
PSA.38.5	 My wounds
PSA.38.5	because of my foolish sins.
PSA.38.6	 I am dazed
PSA.38.6	all day long I walk around mourning.
PSA.38.7	 For I am overcome with shame
PSA.38.7	and my whole body is sick.
PSA.38.8	 I am numb with pain and severely battered;
PSA.38.8	I groan loudly because of the anxiety I feel.
PSA.38.9	 O Lord, you understand my heart’s desire;
PSA.38.9	my groaning is not hidden from you.
PSA.38.10	 My heart beats quickly;
PSA.38.10	my strength leaves me;
PSA.38.10	I can hardly see.
PSA.38.11	 Because of my condition,
PSA.38.11	my neighbors stand far away.
PSA.38.12	 Those who seek my life try to entrap me;
PSA.38.12	those who want to harm me speak destructive words;
PSA.38.12	all day long they say deceitful things.
PSA.38.13	 But I am like a deaf man – I hear nothing;
PSA.38.13	I am like a mute who cannot speak.
PSA.38.14	 I am like a man who cannot hear
PSA.38.14	and is incapable of arguing his defense.
PSA.38.15	 Yet
PSA.38.15	You will respond, O Lord, my God!
PSA.38.16	 I have prayed for deliverance, because otherwise they will gloat over me;
PSA.38.16	when my foot slips they will arrogantly taunt me.
PSA.38.17	 For I am about to stumble,
PSA.38.17	and I am in constant pain.
PSA.38.18	 Yes,
PSA.38.18	and I am concerned about my sins.
PSA.38.19	 But those who are my enemies for no reason are numerous;
PSA.38.19	those who hate me without cause outnumber me.
PSA.38.20	 They repay me evil for the good I have done;
PSA.38.20	though I have tried to do good to them, they hurl accusations at me.
PSA.38.21	 Do not abandon me, O 
PSA.38.21	My God, do not remain far away from me!
PSA.38.22	 Hurry and help me,
PSA.39.1	 I decided,
PSA.39.1	and make sure I do not sin with my tongue.
PSA.39.1	I will put a muzzle over my mouth
PSA.39.1	while in the presence of an evil man.”
PSA.39.2	 I was stone silent;
PSA.39.2	I held back the urge to speak.
PSA.39.2	My frustration grew;
PSA.39.3	 my anxiety intensified.
PSA.39.3	As I thought about it, I became impatient.
PSA.39.3	Finally I spoke these words:
PSA.39.4	 “O 
PSA.39.4	and the brevity of life!
PSA.39.4	Let me realize how quickly my life will pass!
PSA.39.5	 Look, you make my days short-lived,
PSA.39.5	and my life span is nothing from your perspective.
PSA.39.5	Surely all people, even those who seem secure, are nothing but vapor.
PSA.39.6	 Surely people go through life as mere ghosts.
PSA.39.6	Surely they accumulate worthless wealth
PSA.39.6	without knowing who will eventually haul it away.”
PSA.39.7	 But now, O Lord, upon what am I relying?
PSA.39.7	You are my only hope!
PSA.39.8	 Deliver me from all my sins of rebellion!
PSA.39.8	Do not make me the object of fools’ insults!
PSA.39.9	 I am silent and cannot open my mouth
PSA.39.9	because of what you have done.
PSA.39.10	 Please stop wounding me!
PSA.39.10	You have almost beaten me to death!
PSA.39.11	 You severely discipline people for their sins;
PSA.39.11	like a moth you slowly devour their strength.
PSA.39.11	Surely all people are a mere vapor. (Selah)
PSA.39.12	 Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.39.12	Listen to my cry for help!
PSA.39.12	Do not ignore my sobbing!
PSA.39.12	For I am dependent on you, like one residing outside his native land;
PSA.39.12	I am at your mercy, just as all my ancestors were.
PSA.39.13	 Turn your angry gaze away from me, so I can be happy
PSA.39.13	before I pass away.
PSA.40.1	 I relied completely
PSA.40.1	and he turned toward me
PSA.40.1	and heard my cry for help.
PSA.40.2	 He lifted me out of the watery pit,
PSA.40.2	out of the slimy mud.
PSA.40.2	He placed my feet on a rock
PSA.40.2	and gave me secure footing.
PSA.40.3	 He gave me reason to sing a new song,
PSA.40.3	praising our God.
PSA.40.3	May many see what God has done,
PSA.40.3	so that they might swear allegiance to him and trust in the 
PSA.40.4	 How blessed
PSA.40.4	and does not seek help from
PSA.40.5	 O 
PSA.40.5	you have done amazing things and carried out your purposes for us.
PSA.40.5	No one can thwart you!
PSA.40.5	I want to declare them and talk about them,
PSA.40.5	but they are too numerous to recount!
PSA.40.6	 Receiving sacrifices and offerings are not your primary concern.
PSA.40.6	You make that quite clear to me!
PSA.40.6	You do not ask for burnt sacrifices and sin offerings.
PSA.40.7	 Then I say,
PSA.40.7	“Look! I come!
PSA.40.7	What is written in the scroll pertains to me.
PSA.40.8	 I want to do what pleases you,
PSA.40.8	Your law dominates my thoughts.”
PSA.40.9	 I have told the great assembly
PSA.40.9	Look! I spare no words!
PSA.40.9	O 
PSA.40.10	 I have not failed to tell about your justice;
PSA.40.10	I spoke about your reliability and deliverance;
PSA.40.10	I have not neglected to tell the great assembly about your loyal love and faithfulness.
PSA.40.11	 O 
PSA.40.11	May your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect me!
PSA.40.12	 For innumerable dangers
PSA.40.12	My sins overtake me
PSA.40.12	so I am unable to see;
PSA.40.12	they outnumber the hairs of my head
PSA.40.12	so my strength fails me.
PSA.40.13	 Please be willing, O 
PSA.40.13	O 
PSA.40.14	 May those who are trying to snatch away my life
PSA.40.14	 be totally embarrassed and ashamed!
PSA.40.14	May those who want to harm me
PSA.40.14	 be turned back and ashamed!
PSA.40.15	 May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”
PSA.40.15	be humiliated
PSA.40.16	 May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you!
PSA.40.16	May those who love to experience
PSA.40.16	“May the 
PSA.40.17	 I am oppressed and needy!
PSA.40.17	May the Lord pay attention to me!
PSA.40.17	You are my helper and my deliverer!
PSA.40.17	O my God, do not delay!
PSA.41.1	 How blessed
PSA.41.1	When trouble comes,
PSA.41.2	 May the 
PSA.41.2	May he be blessed
PSA.41.2	Do not turn him over
PSA.41.3	 The 
PSA.41.3	you completely heal him from his illness.
PSA.41.4	 As for me, I said:
PSA.41.4	“O 
PSA.41.4	Heal me, for I have sinned against you!
PSA.41.5	 My enemies ask this cruel question about me,
PSA.41.5	‘When will he finally die and be forgotten?’
PSA.41.6	 When someone comes to visit,
PSA.41.6	he thinks of ways to defame me,
PSA.41.6	and when he leaves he slanders me.
PSA.41.7	 All who hate me whisper insults about me to one another;
PSA.41.7	they plan ways to harm me.
PSA.41.8	 They say,
PSA.41.8	‘An awful disease
PSA.41.8	and now that he is bed-ridden he will never recover.’
PSA.41.9	 Even my close friend
PSA.41.9	he who shared meals with me, has turned against me.
PSA.41.10	 As for you, O 
PSA.41.10	so I can pay them back!”
PSA.41.11	 By this
PSA.41.11	for my enemy does
PSA.41.12	 As for me, you uphold
PSA.41.12	you allow
PSA.41.13	 The 
PSA.41.13	in the future and forevermore!
PSA.41.13	We agree! We agree!
PSA.42.1	 As a deer
PSA.42.1	so I long
PSA.42.2	 I thirst
PSA.42.2	for the living God.
PSA.42.2	I say,
PSA.42.3	 I cannot eat, I weep day and night;
PSA.42.3	all day long they say to me,
PSA.42.4	 I will remember and weep!
PSA.42.4	For I was once walking along with the great throng to the temple of God,
PSA.42.4	shouting and giving thanks along with the crowd as we celebrated the holy festival.
PSA.42.5	 Why are you depressed,
PSA.42.5	Why are you upset?
PSA.42.5	Wait for God!
PSA.42.5	For I will again give thanks
PSA.42.5	to my God for his saving intervention.
PSA.42.6	 I am depressed,
PSA.42.6	so I will pray to you while I am trapped here in the region of the upper Jordan,
PSA.42.6	from Hermon,
PSA.42.7	 One deep stream calls out to another
PSA.42.7	all your billows and waves overwhelm me.
PSA.42.8	 By day the 
PSA.42.8	and by night he gives me a song,
PSA.42.8	a prayer
PSA.42.9	 I will pray
PSA.42.9	“Why do you ignore
PSA.42.9	Why must I walk around mourning
PSA.42.9	because my enemies oppress me?”
PSA.42.10	 My enemies’ taunts cut into me to the bone,
PSA.42.10	as they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”
PSA.42.11	 Why are you depressed,
PSA.42.11	Why are you upset?
PSA.42.11	Wait for God!
PSA.42.11	For I will again give thanks
PSA.42.11	to my God for his saving intervention.
PSA.43.1	 Vindicate me, O God!
PSA.43.1	Fight for me
PSA.43.1	Deliver me
PSA.43.2	 For you are the God who shelters me.
PSA.43.2	Why do you reject me?
PSA.43.2	Why must I walk around
PSA.43.2	because my enemies oppress me?
PSA.43.3	 Reveal
PSA.43.3	They will lead me,
PSA.43.3	they will escort
PSA.43.3	and to the place where you live.
PSA.43.4	 Then I will go
PSA.43.4	to the God who gives me ecstatic joy,
PSA.43.4	so that I express my thanks to you,
PSA.43.5	 Why are you depressed,
PSA.43.5	Why are you upset?
PSA.43.5	Wait for God!
PSA.43.5	For I will again give thanks
PSA.43.5	to my God for his saving intervention.
PSA.44.1	 O God, we have clearly heard;
PSA.44.1	our ancestors
PSA.44.1	what you did
PSA.44.1	in ancient times.
PSA.44.2	 You, by your power,
PSA.44.2	you crushed
PSA.44.3	 For they did not conquer
PSA.44.3	and they did not prevail by their strength,
PSA.44.3	but rather by your power,
PSA.44.3	for you were partial to
PSA.44.4	 You are my
PSA.44.4	Decree
PSA.44.5	 By your power
PSA.44.5	by your strength
PSA.44.6	 For I do not trust in my bow,
PSA.44.6	and I do not prevail by my sword.
PSA.44.7	 For you deliver
PSA.44.7	you humiliate
PSA.44.8	 In God I boast all day long,
PSA.44.8	and we will continually give thanks to your name. (Selah)
PSA.44.9	 But
PSA.44.9	You did not go into battle with our armies.
PSA.44.10	 You made us retreat
PSA.44.10	Those who hate us take whatever they want from us.
PSA.44.11	 You handed us
PSA.44.11	you scattered us among the nations.
PSA.44.12	 You sold
PSA.44.12	you did not ask a high price for them.
PSA.44.13	 You made us
PSA.44.13	those who live on our borders taunt and insult us.
PSA.44.14	 You made us
PSA.44.14	foreigners treat us with contempt.
PSA.44.15	 All day long I feel humiliated
PSA.44.15	and am overwhelmed with shame,
PSA.44.16	 before the vindictive enemy
PSA.44.16	who ridicules and insults me.
PSA.44.17	 All this has happened to us, even though we have not rejected you
PSA.44.17	or violated your covenant with us.
PSA.44.18	 We have not been unfaithful,
PSA.44.18	nor have we disobeyed your commands.
PSA.44.19	 Yet you have battered us, leaving us a heap of ruins overrun by wild dogs;
PSA.44.19	you have covered us with darkness.
PSA.44.20	 If we had rejected our God,
PSA.44.20	and spread out our hands in prayer to another god,
PSA.44.21	 would not God discover it,
PSA.44.21	for he knows
PSA.44.22	 Yet because of you
PSA.44.22	we are treated like
PSA.44.23	 Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O Lord?
PSA.44.23	Wake up!
PSA.44.24	 Why do you look the other way,
PSA.44.24	and ignore
PSA.44.25	 For we lie in the dirt,
PSA.44.25	with our bellies pressed to the ground.
PSA.44.26	 Rise up and help us!
PSA.44.26	Rescue us
PSA.45.1	 My heart is stirred by a beautiful song.
PSA.45.1	I say, “I have composed this special song
PSA.45.1	my tongue is as skilled as the stylus of an experienced scribe.”
PSA.45.2	 You are the most handsome of all men!
PSA.45.2	You speak in an impressive and fitting manner!
PSA.45.2	For this reason
PSA.45.3	 Strap your sword to your thigh, O warrior!
PSA.45.3	Appear in your majestic splendor!
PSA.45.4	 Appear in your majesty and be victorious!
PSA.45.4	Ride forth for the sake of what is right,
PSA.45.4	on behalf of justice!
PSA.45.4	Then your right hand will accomplish mighty acts!
PSA.45.5	 Your arrows are sharp
PSA.45.5	and penetrate the hearts of the king’s enemies.
PSA.45.5	Nations fall at your feet.
PSA.45.6	 Your throne,
PSA.45.6	The scepter
PSA.45.7	 You love
PSA.45.7	For this reason God, your God
PSA.45.7	with the oil of joy,
PSA.45.8	 All your garments are perfumed with
PSA.45.8	From the luxurious palaces
PSA.45.9	 Princesses
PSA.45.9	your bride
PSA.45.10	 Listen, O princess!
PSA.45.10	Observe and pay attention!
PSA.45.10	Forget your homeland
PSA.45.11	 Then
PSA.45.11	After all, he is your master! Submit
PSA.45.12	 Rich people from Tyre
PSA.45.12	will seek your favor by bringing a gift.
PSA.45.13	 The princess
PSA.45.13	decked out in pearls and clothed in a brocade trimmed with gold.
PSA.45.14	 In embroidered robes she is escorted to the king.
PSA.45.14	Her attendants, the maidens of honor who follow her,
PSA.45.14	are led before you.
PSA.45.15	 They are bubbling with joy as they walk in procession
PSA.45.15	and enter the royal palace.
PSA.45.16	 Your
PSA.45.16	you will make them princes throughout the land.
PSA.45.17	 I will proclaim your greatness through the coming years,
PSA.45.17	then the nations will praise you
PSA.46.1	 God is our strong refuge;
PSA.46.1	he is truly our helper in times of trouble.
PSA.46.2	 For this reason we do not fear
PSA.46.2	and the mountains tumble into the depths of the sea,
PSA.46.3	 when its waves
PSA.46.3	and the mountains shake
PSA.46.4	 The river’s channels bring joy to the city of God,
PSA.46.4	the special, holy dwelling place of
PSA.46.5	 God lives within it,
PSA.46.5	God rescues it
PSA.46.6	 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms are overthrown.
PSA.46.6	God
PSA.46.7	 The 
PSA.46.7	The God of Jacob
PSA.46.8	 Come! Witness the exploits
PSA.46.8	who brings devastation to the earth!
PSA.46.9	 He brings an end to wars throughout the earth;
PSA.46.9	he shatters
PSA.46.9	he burns
PSA.46.10	 He says,
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted
PSA.46.11	 The 
PSA.46.11	The God of Jacob
PSA.47.1	 All you nations, clap your hands!
PSA.47.1	Shout out to God in celebration!
PSA.47.2	 For the sovereign 
PSA.47.2	he is the great king who rules the whole earth!
PSA.47.3	 He subdued nations beneath us
PSA.47.3	and countries
PSA.47.4	 He picked out for us a special land
PSA.47.4	to be a source of pride for
PSA.47.5	 God has ascended his throne
PSA.47.5	the 
PSA.47.6	 Sing to God! Sing!
PSA.47.6	Sing to our king! Sing!
PSA.47.7	 For God is king of the whole earth!
PSA.47.7	Sing a well-written song!
PSA.47.8	 God reigns
PSA.47.8	God sits on his holy throne!
PSA.47.9	 The nobles of the nations assemble,
PSA.47.9	along with the people of the God of Abraham,
PSA.47.9	for God has authority over the rulers
PSA.47.9	He is highly exalted!
PSA.48.1	 The 
PSA.48.1	in the city of our God,
PSA.48.2	 It is lofty and pleasing to look at,
PSA.48.2	a source of joy to the whole earth.
PSA.48.2	Mount Zion resembles the peaks of Zaphon;
PSA.48.2	it is the city of the great king.
PSA.48.3	 God is in its fortresses;
PSA.48.3	he reveals himself as its defender.
PSA.48.4	 For
PSA.48.4	they advance together.
PSA.48.5	 As soon as they see,
PSA.48.5	they are terrified, they quickly retreat.
PSA.48.6	 Look at them shake uncontrollably,
PSA.48.6	like a woman writhing in childbirth.
PSA.48.7	 With an east wind
PSA.48.7	you shatter
PSA.48.8	 We heard about God’s mighty deeds, now we have seen them,
PSA.48.8	in the city of the 
PSA.48.8	in the city of our God.
PSA.48.8	God makes it permanently secure.
PSA.48.9	 We reflect on your loyal love, O God,
PSA.48.9	within your temple.
PSA.48.10	 The praise you receive as far away as the ends of the earth
PSA.48.10	is worthy of your reputation, O God.
PSA.48.10	You execute justice!
PSA.48.11	 Mount Zion rejoices;
PSA.48.11	the towns
PSA.48.11	because of your acts of judgment.
PSA.48.12	 Walk around
PSA.48.12	Count its towers!
PSA.48.13	 Consider its defenses!
PSA.48.13	Walk through
PSA.48.13	so you can tell the next generation about it!
PSA.48.14	 For God, our God, is our defender forever!
PSA.48.14	He guides
PSA.49.1	 Listen to this, all you nations!
PSA.49.1	Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the world!
PSA.49.2	 Pay attention, all you people,
PSA.49.2	both rich and poor!
PSA.49.3	 I will declare a wise saying;
PSA.49.3	I will share my profound thoughts.
PSA.49.4	 I will learn a song that imparts wisdom;
PSA.49.4	I will then sing my insightful song to the accompaniment of a harp.
PSA.49.5	 Why should I be afraid in times of trouble,
PSA.49.5	when the sinful deeds of deceptive men threaten to overwhelm me?
PSA.49.6	 They trust
PSA.49.6	and boast
PSA.49.7	 Certainly a man cannot rescue his brother;
PSA.49.7	he cannot pay God an adequate ransom price
PSA.49.8	 (the ransom price for a human life
PSA.49.8	and people go to their final destiny),
PSA.49.9	 so that he might continue to live
PSA.49.9	and not experience death.
PSA.49.10	 Surely
PSA.49.10	fools and spiritually insensitive people all pass away
PSA.49.10	and leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	 Their grave becomes their permanent residence,
PSA.49.11	their eternal dwelling place.
PSA.49.11	They name their lands after themselves,
PSA.49.12	 but, despite their wealth, people do not last,
PSA.49.12	they are like animals
PSA.49.13	 This is the destiny of fools,
PSA.49.13	and of those who approve of their philosophy.
PSA.49.14	 They will travel to Sheol like sheep,
PSA.49.14	with death as their shepherd.
PSA.49.14	The godly will rule
PSA.49.14	Sheol will consume their bodies and they will no longer live in impressive houses.
PSA.49.15	 But
PSA.49.15	certainly
PSA.49.16	 Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich
PSA.49.16	and his wealth multiplies!
PSA.49.17	 For he will take nothing with him when he dies;
PSA.49.17	his wealth will not follow him down into the grave.
PSA.49.18	 He pronounces this blessing on himself while he is alive:
PSA.49.18	“May men praise you, for you have done well!”
PSA.49.19	 But he will join his ancestors;
PSA.49.19	they will never again see the light of day.
PSA.49.20	 Wealthy people do not understand;
PSA.49.20	they are like animals
PSA.50.1	 El, God, the 
PSA.50.1	and summons the earth to come from the east and west.
PSA.50.2	 From Zion, the most beautiful of all places,
PSA.50.2	God comes in splendor.
PSA.50.3	 Our God approaches and is not silent;
PSA.50.3	consuming fire goes ahead of him
PSA.50.3	and all around him a storm rages.
PSA.50.4	 He summons the heavens above,
PSA.50.4	as well as the earth, so that he might judge his people.
PSA.50.5	 He says:
PSA.50.5	“Assemble my covenant people before me,
PSA.50.5	those who ratified a covenant with me by sacrifice!”
PSA.50.6	 The heavens declare his fairness,
PSA.50.6	for God is judge.
PSA.50.7	 He says:
PSA.50.7	“Listen my people! I am speaking!
PSA.50.7	Listen Israel! I am accusing you!
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God!
PSA.50.8	 I am not condemning
PSA.50.8	or because of your burnt sacrifices that you continually offer me.
PSA.50.9	 I do not need to take
PSA.50.9	or goats from your sheepfolds.
PSA.50.10	 For every wild animal in the forest belongs to me,
PSA.50.10	as well as the cattle that graze on a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	 I keep track of
PSA.50.11	and the insects
PSA.50.12	 Even if I were hungry, I would not tell you,
PSA.50.12	for the world and all it contains belong to me.
PSA.50.13	 Do I eat the flesh of bulls?
PSA.50.13	Do I drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	 Present to God a thank-offering!
PSA.50.14	Repay your vows to the sovereign One!
PSA.50.15	 Pray to me when you are in trouble!
PSA.50.15	I will deliver you, and you will honor me!”
PSA.50.16	 God says this to the evildoer:
PSA.50.16	“How can you declare my commands,
PSA.50.16	and talk about my covenant?
PSA.50.17	 For you hate instruction
PSA.50.17	and reject my words.
PSA.50.18	 When you see a thief, you join him;
PSA.50.18	you associate with men who are unfaithful to their wives.
PSA.50.19	 You do damage with words,
PSA.50.19	and use your tongue to deceive.
PSA.50.20	 You plot against your brother;
PSA.50.20	you slander your own brother.
PSA.50.21	 When you did these things, I was silent,
PSA.50.21	so you thought I was exactly like you.
PSA.50.21	But now I will condemn
PSA.50.21	and state my case against you!
PSA.50.22	 Carefully consider this, you who reject God!
PSA.50.22	Otherwise I will rip you to shreds
PSA.50.22	and no one will be able to rescue you.
PSA.50.23	 Whoever presents a thank-offering honors me.
PSA.50.23	To whoever obeys my commands, I will reveal my power to deliver.”
PSA.51.1	 Have mercy on me, O God, because of
PSA.51.1	Because of
PSA.51.2	 Wash away my wrongdoing!
PSA.51.2	Cleanse me of my sin!
PSA.51.3	 For I am aware of
PSA.51.3	I am forever conscious of my sin.
PSA.51.4	 Against you – you above all
PSA.51.4	I have done what is evil in your sight.
PSA.51.4	So
PSA.51.4	you are right when you condemn me.
PSA.51.5	 Look, I was guilty of sin from birth,
PSA.51.5	a sinner the moment my mother conceived me.
PSA.51.6	 Look,
PSA.51.6	you want me to possess wisdom.
PSA.51.7	 Sprinkle me
PSA.51.7	wash me
PSA.51.8	 Grant me the ultimate joy of being forgiven!
PSA.51.8	May the bones
PSA.51.9	 Hide your face
PSA.51.9	Wipe away
PSA.51.10	 Create for me a pure heart, O God!
PSA.51.10	Renew a resolute spirit within me!
PSA.51.11	 Do not reject me!
PSA.51.11	Do not take your Holy Spirit
PSA.51.12	 Let me again experience the joy of your deliverance!
PSA.51.12	Sustain me by giving me the desire to obey!
PSA.51.13	 Then I will teach
PSA.51.13	and sinners will turn
PSA.51.14	 Rescue me from the guilt of murder,
PSA.51.14	Then my tongue will shout for joy because of your deliverance.
PSA.51.15	 O Lord, give me the words!
PSA.51.15	Then my mouth will praise you.
PSA.51.16	 Certainly
PSA.51.16	you do not desire a burnt sacrifice.
PSA.51.17	 The sacrifices God desires are a humble spirit
PSA.51.17	O God, a humble and repentant heart
PSA.51.18	 Because you favor Zion, do what is good for her!
PSA.51.18	Fortify
PSA.51.19	 Then you will accept
PSA.51.19	then bulls will be sacrificed
PSA.52.1	 Why do you boast about your evil plans,
PSA.52.1	God’s loyal love protects me all day long!
PSA.52.2	 Your tongue carries out your destructive plans;
PSA.52.2	it is as effective as a sharp razor, O deceiver.
PSA.52.3	 You love evil more than good,
PSA.52.3	lies more than speaking the truth.
PSA.52.4	 You love to use all the words that destroy,
PSA.52.4	and the tongue that deceives.
PSA.52.5	 Yet
PSA.52.5	He will scoop you up
PSA.52.5	he will uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)
PSA.52.6	 When the godly see this, they will be filled with awe,
PSA.52.6	and will mock the evildoer, saying:
PSA.52.7	 “Look, here is the man who would not make
PSA.52.7	He trusted in his great wealth
PSA.52.7	and was confident about his plans to destroy others.”
PSA.52.8	 But I
PSA.52.8	I continually
PSA.52.9	 I will continually
PSA.52.9	I will rely
PSA.53.1	 Fools say to themselves,
PSA.53.1	They sin and commit evil deeds;
PSA.53.1	none of them does what is right.
PSA.53.2	 God looks down from heaven
PSA.53.2	to see if there is anyone who is wise
PSA.53.3	 Everyone rejects God;
PSA.53.3	they are all morally corrupt.
PSA.53.3	None of them does what is right,
PSA.53.3	not even one!
PSA.53.4	 All those who behave wickedly
PSA.53.4	those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,
PSA.53.4	and do not call out to God.
PSA.53.5	 They are absolutely terrified,
PSA.53.5	even by things that do not normally cause fear.
PSA.53.5	For God annihilates
PSA.53.5	You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them.
PSA.53.6	 I wish the deliverance
PSA.53.6	When God restores the well-being of his people,
PSA.53.6	may Jacob rejoice,
PSA.53.6	may Israel be happy!
PSA.54.1	 O God, deliver me by your name!
PSA.54.1	Vindicate me
PSA.54.2	 O God, listen to my prayer!
PSA.54.2	Pay attention to what I say!
PSA.54.3	 For foreigners
PSA.54.3	ruthless men, who do not respect God, seek my life.
PSA.54.4	 Look, God is my deliverer!
PSA.54.4	The Lord is among those who support me.
PSA.54.5	 May those who wait to ambush me
PSA.54.5	As a demonstration of your faithfulness,
PSA.54.6	 With a freewill offering I will sacrifice
PSA.54.6	I will give thanks to your name, O 
PSA.54.7	 Surely
PSA.54.7	and I triumph over my enemies.
PSA.55.1	 Listen, O God, to my prayer!
PSA.55.1	Do not ignore
PSA.55.2	 Pay attention to me and answer me!
PSA.55.2	I am so upset
PSA.55.3	 because of what the enemy says,
PSA.55.3	and because of how the wicked
PSA.55.3	for they hurl trouble
PSA.55.3	and angrily attack me.
PSA.55.4	 My heart beats violently
PSA.55.4	the horrors of death overcome me.
PSA.55.5	 Fear and panic overpower me;
PSA.55.5	terror overwhelms
PSA.55.6	 I say,
PSA.55.6	I would fly away and settle in a safe place!
PSA.55.7	 Look, I will escape to a distant place;
PSA.55.7	I will stay in the wilderness. (Selah)
PSA.55.8	 I will hurry off to a place that is safe
PSA.55.8	from the strong wind
PSA.55.9	 Confuse them,
PSA.55.9	Frustrate their plans!
PSA.55.9	For I see violence and conflict in the city.
PSA.55.10	 Day and night they walk around on its walls,
PSA.55.10	while wickedness and destruction
PSA.55.11	 Disaster is within it;
PSA.55.11	violence
PSA.55.12	 Indeed,
PSA.55.12	or else I could bear it;
PSA.55.12	it is not one who hates me who arrogantly taunts me,
PSA.55.12	or else I could hide from him.
PSA.55.13	 But it is you,
PSA.55.13	my close friend in whom I confided.
PSA.55.14	 We would share personal thoughts with each other;
PSA.55.14	in God’s temple we would walk together among the crowd.
PSA.55.15	 May death destroy them!
PSA.55.15	May they go down alive into Sheol!
PSA.55.15	For evil is in their dwelling place and in their midst.
PSA.55.16	 As for me, I will call out to God,
PSA.55.16	and the 
PSA.55.17	 During the evening, morning, and noontime
PSA.55.17	I will lament and moan,
PSA.55.17	and he will hear
PSA.55.18	 He will rescue
PSA.55.18	even though
PSA.55.19	 God, the one who has reigned as king from long ago,
PSA.55.19	will hear and humiliate them.
PSA.55.19	They refuse to change,
PSA.55.19	and do not fear God.
PSA.55.20	 He
PSA.55.20	he breaks his solemn promises to them.
PSA.55.21	 His words are as smooth as butter,
PSA.55.21	but he harbors animosity in his heart.
PSA.55.21	His words seem softer than oil,
PSA.55.21	but they are really like sharp swords.
PSA.55.22	 Throw your burden
PSA.55.22	and he will sustain you.
PSA.55.22	He will never allow the godly to be upended.
PSA.55.23	 But you, O God, will bring them
PSA.55.23	Violent and deceitful people
PSA.55.23	But as for me, I trust in you.
PSA.56.1	 Have mercy on me, O God, for men are attacking me!
PSA.56.1	All day long hostile enemies
PSA.56.2	 Those who anticipate my defeat
PSA.56.2	Indeed,
PSA.56.3	 When
PSA.56.3	I trust in you.
PSA.56.4	 In God – I boast in his promise
PSA.56.4	in God I trust, I am not afraid.
PSA.56.4	What can mere men
PSA.56.5	 All day long they cause me trouble;
PSA.56.5	they make a habit of plotting my demise.
PSA.56.6	 They stalk
PSA.56.6	they watch my every step,
PSA.56.6	as
PSA.56.7	 Because they are bent on violence, do not let them escape!
PSA.56.7	In your anger
PSA.56.8	 You keep track of my misery.
PSA.56.8	Put my tears in your leather container!
PSA.56.8	Are they not recorded in your scroll?
PSA.56.9	 My enemies will turn back when I cry out to you for help;
PSA.56.9	I know that God is on my side.
PSA.56.10	 In God – I boast in his promise
PSA.56.10	in the 
PSA.56.11	 in God I trust, I am not afraid.
PSA.56.11	What can mere men
PSA.56.12	 I am obligated to fulfill the vows I made to you, O God;
PSA.56.12	I will give you the thank-offerings you deserve,
PSA.56.13	 when you deliver
PSA.56.13	You keep my feet from stumbling,
PSA.56.13	so that I might serve
PSA.57.1	 Have mercy on me, O God! Have mercy on me!
PSA.57.1	For in you I have taken shelter.
PSA.57.1	In the shadow of your wings
PSA.57.1	until trouble passes.
PSA.57.2	 I cry out for help to the sovereign God,
PSA.57.2	to the God who vindicates
PSA.57.3	 May he send help from heaven and deliver me
PSA.57.3	from my enemies who hurl insults!
PSA.57.3	May God send his loyal love and faithfulness!
PSA.57.4	 I am surrounded by lions;
PSA.57.4	I lie down
PSA.57.4	men whose teeth are spears and arrows,
PSA.57.4	whose tongues are a sharp sword.
PSA.57.5	 Rise up
PSA.57.5	May your splendor cover the whole earth!
PSA.57.6	 They have prepared a net to trap me;
PSA.57.6	I am discouraged.
PSA.57.6	They have dug a pit for me.
PSA.57.6	They will fall
PSA.57.7	 I am determined,
PSA.57.7	I will sing and praise you!
PSA.57.8	 Awake, my soul!
PSA.57.8	Awake, O stringed instrument and harp!
PSA.57.8	I will wake up at dawn!
PSA.57.9	 I will give you thanks before the nations, O Master!
PSA.57.9	I will sing praises to you before foreigners!
PSA.57.10	 For your loyal love extends beyond the sky,
PSA.57.10	and your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
PSA.57.11	 Rise up
PSA.57.11	May your splendor cover the whole earth!
PSA.58.1	 Do you rulers really pronounce just decisions?
PSA.58.1	Do you judge people
PSA.58.2	 No!
PSA.58.2	you deal out violence in the earth.
PSA.58.3	 The wicked turn aside from birth;
PSA.58.3	liars go astray as soon as they are born.
PSA.58.4	 Their venom is like that of a snake,
PSA.58.4	like a deaf serpent
PSA.58.5	 that does not respond to
PSA.58.5	or to a skilled snake-charmer.
PSA.58.6	 O God, break the teeth in their mouths!
PSA.58.6	Smash the jawbones of the lions, O 
PSA.58.7	 Let them disappear
PSA.58.7	Let them wither like grass!
PSA.58.8	 Let them be
PSA.58.8	Let them be like
PSA.58.9	 Before the kindling is even placed under your pots,
PSA.58.9	he
PSA.58.10	 The godly
PSA.58.10	they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	 Then
PSA.58.11	“Yes indeed, the godly are rewarded!
PSA.58.11	Yes indeed, there is a God who judges
PSA.59.1	 Deliver me from my enemies, my God!
PSA.59.1	Protect me
PSA.59.2	 Deliver me from evildoers!
PSA.59.2	Rescue me from violent men!
PSA.59.3	 For look, they wait to ambush me;
PSA.59.3	powerful men stalk
PSA.59.3	but not because I have rebelled or sinned, O 
PSA.59.4	 Though I have done nothing wrong,
PSA.59.4	Spring into action and help me! Take notice of me!
PSA.59.5	 You, O 
PSA.59.5	rouse yourself and punish
PSA.59.5	Have no mercy on any treacherous evildoers! (Selah)
PSA.59.6	 They return in the evening;
PSA.59.6	they growl
PSA.59.6	and prowl around outside
PSA.59.7	 Look, they hurl insults at me
PSA.59.7	and openly threaten to kill me,
PSA.59.7	for they say,
PSA.59.7	“Who hears?”
PSA.59.8	 But you, O 
PSA.59.8	you taunt
PSA.59.9	 You are my source of strength! I will wait for you!
PSA.59.9	For God is my refuge.
PSA.59.10	 The God who loves me will help me;
PSA.59.10	God will enable me to triumph over
PSA.59.11	 Do not strike them dead suddenly,
PSA.59.11	because then my people might forget the lesson.
PSA.59.11	Use your power to make them homeless vagabonds and then bring them down,
PSA.59.11	O Lord who shields us!
PSA.59.12	 They speak sinful words.
PSA.59.12	So let them be trapped by their own pride
PSA.59.12	and by the curses and lies they speak!
PSA.59.13	 Angrily wipe them out! Wipe them out so they vanish!
PSA.59.13	Let them know that God rules
PSA.59.13	in Jacob and to the ends of the earth! (Selah)
PSA.59.14	 They return in the evening;
PSA.59.14	they growl
PSA.59.14	and prowl around outside
PSA.59.15	 They wander around looking for something to eat;
PSA.59.15	they refuse to sleep until they are full.
PSA.59.16	 As for me, I will sing about your strength;
PSA.59.16	I will praise your loyal love in the morning.
PSA.59.16	For you are my refuge
PSA.59.16	and my place of shelter when I face trouble.
PSA.59.17	 You are my source of strength! I will sing praises to you!
PSA.59.17	For God is my refuge,
PSA.60.1	 O God, you have rejected us.
PSA.60.1	You suddenly turned on us in your anger.
PSA.60.1	Please restore us!
PSA.60.2	 You made the earth quake; you split it open.
PSA.60.2	Repair its breaches, for it is ready to fall.
PSA.60.3	 You have made your people experience hard times;
PSA.60.3	you have made us drink intoxicating wine.
PSA.60.4	 You have given your loyal followers
PSA.60.4	so that they might seek safety from the bow.
PSA.60.5	 Deliver by your power
PSA.60.5	so that the ones you love may be safe.
PSA.60.6	 God has spoken in his sanctuary:
PSA.60.6	“I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem;
PSA.60.6	the Valley of Succoth I will measure off.
PSA.60.7	 Gilead belongs to me,
PSA.60.7	as does Manasseh!
PSA.60.7	Ephraim is my helmet,
PSA.60.7	Judah my royal scepter.
PSA.60.8	 Moab is my washbasin.
PSA.60.8	I will make Edom serve me.
PSA.60.8	I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”
PSA.60.9	 Who will lead me into the fortified city?
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	 Have you not rejected us, O God?
PSA.60.10	O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.
PSA.60.11	 Give us help against the enemy,
PSA.60.11	for any help men might offer is futile.
PSA.60.12	 By God’s power we will conquer;
PSA.60.12	he will trample down
PSA.61.1	 O God, hear my cry for help!
PSA.61.1	Pay attention to my prayer!
PSA.61.2	 From the most remote place on earth
PSA.61.2	I call out to you in my despair.
PSA.61.2	Lead me
PSA.61.3	 Indeed,
PSA.61.3	a strong tower that protects me from the enemy.
PSA.61.4	 I will be a permanent guest in your home;
PSA.61.4	I will find shelter in the protection of your wings.
PSA.61.5	 For you, O God, hear my vows;
PSA.61.5	you grant me the reward that belongs to your loyal followers.
PSA.61.6	 Give the king long life!
PSA.61.6	Make his lifetime span several generations!
PSA.61.7	 May he reign
PSA.61.7	Decree that your loyal love and faithfulness should protect him.
PSA.61.8	 Then I will sing praises to your name continually,
PSA.61.8	as I fulfill
PSA.62.1	 For God alone I patiently wait;
PSA.62.1	he is the one who delivers me.
PSA.62.2	 He alone is my protector
PSA.62.2	He is my refuge;
PSA.62.3	 How long will you threaten
PSA.62.3	All of you are murderers,
PSA.62.3	as dangerous as a leaning wall or an unstable fence.
PSA.62.4	 They
PSA.62.4	They love to use deceit;
PSA.62.4	they pronounce blessings with their mouths,
PSA.62.4	but inwardly they utter curses.
PSA.62.5	 Patiently wait for God alone, my soul!
PSA.62.5	For he is the one who gives me confidence.
PSA.62.6	 He alone is my protector
PSA.62.6	He is my refuge;
PSA.62.7	 God delivers me and exalts me;
PSA.62.7	God is my strong protector and my shelter.
PSA.62.8	 Trust in him at all times, you people!
PSA.62.8	Pour out your hearts before him!
PSA.62.8	God is our shelter! (Selah)
PSA.62.9	 Men are nothing but a mere breath;
PSA.62.9	human beings are unreliable.
PSA.62.9	When they are weighed in the scales,
PSA.62.9	all of them together are lighter than air.
PSA.62.10	 Do not trust in what you can gain by oppression!
PSA.62.10	Do not put false confidence in what you can gain by robbery!
PSA.62.10	If wealth increases, do not become attached to it!
PSA.62.11	 God has declared one principle;
PSA.62.11	two principles I have heard:
PSA.62.11	God is strong,
PSA.62.12	 and you, O Lord, demonstrate loyal love.
PSA.62.12	For you repay men for what they do.
PSA.63.1	 O God, you are my God! I long for you!
PSA.63.1	My soul thirsts
PSA.63.1	my flesh yearns for you,
PSA.63.1	in a dry and parched
PSA.63.2	 Yes,
PSA.63.2	and witnessed
PSA.63.3	 Because
PSA.63.3	my lips will praise you.
PSA.63.4	 For this reason
PSA.63.4	in your name I will lift up my hands.
PSA.63.5	 As if with choice meat
PSA.63.5	My mouth joyfully praises you,
PSA.63.6	 whenever
PSA.63.6	and think about you during the nighttime hours.
PSA.63.7	 For you are my deliverer;
PSA.63.7	under your wings
PSA.63.8	 My soul
PSA.63.8	your right hand upholds me.
PSA.63.9	 Enemies seek to destroy my life,
PSA.63.9	but they will descend into the depths of the earth.
PSA.63.10	 Each one will be handed over to the sword;
PSA.63.10	their corpses will be eaten by jackals.
PSA.63.11	 But the king
PSA.63.11	everyone who takes oaths in his name
PSA.63.11	for the mouths of those who speak lies will be shut up.
PSA.64.1	 Listen to me,
PSA.64.1	Protect
PSA.64.2	 Hide me from the plots of evil men,
PSA.64.2	from the crowd of evildoers.
PSA.64.3	 They
PSA.64.3	they aim their arrow, a slanderous charge,
PSA.64.4	 in order to shoot down the innocent
PSA.64.4	They shoot at him suddenly and are unafraid of retaliation.
PSA.64.5	 They encourage one another to carry out their evil deed.
PSA.64.5	They plan how to hide
PSA.64.5	and boast,
PSA.64.6	 They devise
PSA.64.6	they disguise
PSA.64.6	Man’s inner thoughts cannot be discovered.
PSA.64.7	 But God will shoot
PSA.64.7	suddenly they will be
PSA.64.8	 Their slander will bring about their demise.
PSA.64.8	All who see them will shudder,
PSA.64.9	 and all people will fear.
PSA.64.9	They will proclaim
PSA.64.9	and reflect on his deeds.
PSA.64.10	 The godly will rejoice in the 
PSA.64.10	and take shelter in him.
PSA.64.10	All the morally upright
PSA.65.1	 Praise awaits you,
PSA.65.1	Vows made to you are fulfilled.
PSA.65.2	 You hear prayers;
PSA.65.2	all people approach you.
PSA.65.3	 Our record of sins overwhelms me,
PSA.65.3	but you forgive
PSA.65.4	 How blessed
PSA.65.4	and allow to live in your palace courts.
PSA.65.4	May we be satisfied with the good things of your house – 
PSA.65.4	your holy palace.
PSA.65.5	 You answer our prayers by performing awesome acts of deliverance,
PSA.65.5	O God, our savior.
PSA.65.5	All the ends of the earth trust in you,
PSA.65.5	as well as those living across the wide seas.
PSA.65.6	 You created the mountains by your power,
PSA.65.6	and demonstrated your strength.
PSA.65.7	 You calm the raging seas
PSA.65.7	and their roaring waves,
PSA.65.7	as well as the commotion made by the nations.
PSA.65.8	 Even those living in the most remote areas are awestruck by your acts;
PSA.65.8	you cause those living in the east and west to praise you.
PSA.65.9	 You visit the earth and give it rain;
PSA.65.9	you make it rich and fertile
PSA.65.9	with overflowing streams full of water.
PSA.65.9	You provide grain for them,
PSA.65.9	for you prepare the earth to yield its crops.
PSA.65.10	 You saturate
PSA.65.10	and soak
PSA.65.10	With rain showers you soften its soil,
PSA.65.10	and make its crops grow.
PSA.65.11	 You crown the year with your good blessings,
PSA.65.11	and you leave abundance in your wake.
PSA.65.12	 The pastures in the wilderness glisten with moisture,
PSA.65.12	and the hills are clothed with joy.
PSA.65.13	 The meadows are clothed with sheep,
PSA.65.13	and the valleys are covered with grain.
PSA.65.13	They shout joyfully, yes, they sing.
PSA.66.1	 Shout out praise to God, all the earth!
PSA.66.2	 Sing praises about the majesty of his reputation!
PSA.66.2	Give him the honor he deserves!
PSA.66.3	 Say to God:
PSA.66.3	“How awesome are your deeds!
PSA.66.3	Because of your great power your enemies cower in fear
PSA.66.4	 All the earth worships
PSA.66.4	and sings praises to you!
PSA.66.4	They sing praises to your name!” (Selah)
PSA.66.5	 Come and witness
PSA.66.5	His acts on behalf of people are awesome!
PSA.66.6	 He turned the sea into dry land;
PSA.66.6	they passed through the river on foot.
PSA.66.6	Let us rejoice in him there!
PSA.66.7	 He rules
PSA.66.7	he watches
PSA.66.7	Stubborn rebels should not exalt
PSA.66.8	 Praise
PSA.66.8	Loudly proclaim his praise!
PSA.66.9	 He preserves our lives
PSA.66.9	and does not allow our feet to slip.
PSA.66.10	 For
PSA.66.10	you purified us like refined silver.
PSA.66.11	 You led us into a trap;
PSA.66.11	you caused us to suffer.
PSA.66.12	 You allowed men to ride over our heads;
PSA.66.12	we passed through fire and water,
PSA.66.12	but you brought us out into a wide open place.
PSA.66.13	 I will enter
PSA.66.13	I will fulfill the vows I made to you,
PSA.66.14	 which my lips uttered
PSA.66.14	and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	 I will offer up to you fattened animals as burnt sacrifices,
PSA.66.15	along with the smell of sacrificial rams.
PSA.66.15	I will offer cattle and goats. (Selah)
PSA.66.16	 Come! Listen, all you who are loyal to God!
PSA.66.16	I will declare what he has done for me.
PSA.66.17	 I cried out to him for help
PSA.66.17	and praised him with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	 If I had harbored sin in my heart,
PSA.66.18	the Lord would not have listened.
PSA.66.19	 However, God heard;
PSA.66.19	he listened to my prayer.
PSA.66.20	 God deserves praise,
PSA.66.20	for
PSA.66.20	or abandon his love for me!
PSA.67.1	 May God show us his favor
PSA.67.1	May he smile on us!
PSA.67.2	 Then those living on earth will know what you are like;
PSA.67.2	all nations will know how you deliver your people.
PSA.67.3	 Let the nations thank you, O God!
PSA.67.3	Let all the nations thank you!
PSA.67.4	 Let foreigners
PSA.67.4	For you execute justice among the nations,
PSA.67.4	and govern the people living on earth.
PSA.67.5	 Let the nations thank you, O God!
PSA.67.5	Let all the nations thank you!

PSA.67.7	Then all the ends of the earth will give him the honor he deserves.
PSA.68.1	 God springs into action!
PSA.68.1	His enemies scatter;
PSA.68.1	his adversaries
PSA.68.2	 As smoke is driven away by the wind, so you drive them away.
PSA.68.2	As wax melts before fire,
PSA.68.2	so the wicked are destroyed before God.
PSA.68.3	 But the godly

PSA.68.5	God rules from his holy palace.
PSA.68.6	 God settles those who have been deserted in their own homes;
PSA.68.6	he frees prisoners and grants them prosperity.
PSA.68.6	But sinful rebels live in the desert.
PSA.68.7	 O God, when you lead your people into battle,
PSA.68.7	when you march through the desert,
PSA.68.8	 the earth shakes,
PSA.68.8	yes, the heavens pour down rain
PSA.68.8	before God, the God of Sinai,
PSA.68.8	before God, the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	 O God, you cause abundant showers to fall
PSA.68.9	When they
PSA.68.10	 for you live among them.
PSA.68.10	You sustain the oppressed with your good blessings, O God.
PSA.68.11	 The Lord speaks;
PSA.68.11	many, many women spread the good news.
PSA.68.12	 Kings leading armies run away – they run away!
PSA.68.12	The lovely lady
PSA.68.13	 When
PSA.68.13	the wings of the dove are covered with silver
PSA.68.13	and with glittering gold.
PSA.68.14	 When the sovereign judge
PSA.68.14	let it snow
PSA.68.15	 The mountain of Bashan
PSA.68.15	the mountain of Bashan is a mountain with many peaks.
PSA.68.16	 Why do you look with envy,
PSA.68.16	at the mountain where God has decided to live?
PSA.68.16	Indeed
PSA.68.17	 God has countless chariots;
PSA.68.17	they number in the thousands.
PSA.68.17	The Lord comes from Sinai in holy splendor.
PSA.68.18	 You ascend on high,
PSA.68.18	you have taken many captives.
PSA.68.18	You receive tribute
PSA.68.18	including even sinful rebels.
PSA.68.18	Indeed the 
PSA.68.19	 The Lord deserves praise!
PSA.68.19	Day after day
PSA.68.19	the God who delivers us. (Selah)
PSA.68.20	 Our God is a God who delivers;
PSA.68.20	the 
PSA.68.21	 Indeed God strikes the heads of his enemies,
PSA.68.21	the hairy foreheads of those who persist in rebellion.
PSA.68.22	 The Lord says,
PSA.68.22	“I will retrieve them
PSA.68.22	I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,
PSA.68.23	 so that your feet may stomp
PSA.68.23	and your dogs may eat their portion of the enemies’ corpses.”
PSA.68.24	 They
PSA.68.24	the processions of my God, my king, who marches along in holy splendor.
PSA.68.25	 Singers walk in front;
PSA.68.25	musicians follow playing their stringed instruments,
PSA.68.25	in the midst of young women playing tambourines.
PSA.68.26	 In your large assemblies praise God,
PSA.68.26	the 
PSA.68.27	 There is little Benjamin, their ruler,
PSA.68.27	and the princes of Judah in their robes,
PSA.68.27	along with the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	 God has decreed that you will be powerful.
PSA.68.28	O God, you who have acted on our behalf, demonstrate your power,
PSA.68.29	 as you come out of your temple in Jerusalem!
PSA.68.29	Kings bring tribute to you.
PSA.68.30	 Sound your battle cry
PSA.68.30	and the nations that assemble like a herd of calves led by bulls!
PSA.68.30	They humble themselves

PSA.68.31	 They come with red cloth
PSA.68.31	Ethiopia
PSA.68.32	 O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God!
PSA.68.32	Sing praises to the Lord, (Selah)
PSA.68.33	 to the one who rides through the sky from ancient times!
PSA.68.33	Look! He thunders loudly.

PSA.68.34	his sovereignty over Israel,
PSA.68.34	and the power he reveals in the skies!
PSA.68.35	 You are awe-inspiring, O God, as you emerge from your holy temple!
PSA.68.35	It is the God of Israel
PSA.68.35	God deserves praise!
PSA.69.1	 Deliver me, O God,
PSA.69.1	for the water has reached my neck.
PSA.69.2	 I sink into the deep mire
PSA.69.2	where there is no solid ground;
PSA.69.2	I am in
PSA.69.2	and the current overpowers me.
PSA.69.3	 I am exhausted from shouting for help;
PSA.69.3	my throat is sore;
PSA.69.3	my eyes grow tired of looking for my God.
PSA.69.4	 Those who hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs of my head.
PSA.69.4	Those who want to destroy me, my enemies for no reason,
PSA.69.4	They make me repay what I did not steal!
PSA.69.5	 O God, you are aware of my foolish sins;
PSA.69.5	my guilt is not hidden from you.
PSA.69.6	 Let none who rely on you be disgraced because of me,
PSA.69.6	O sovereign 
PSA.69.6	Let none who seek you be ashamed because of me,
PSA.69.6	O God of Israel!
PSA.69.7	 For I suffer
PSA.69.7	and am thoroughly disgraced.
PSA.69.8	 My own brothers treat me like a stranger;
PSA.69.8	they act as if I were a foreigner.
PSA.69.9	 Certainly
PSA.69.9	I endure the insults of those who insult you.
PSA.69.10	 I weep and refrain from eating food,
PSA.69.10	which causes others to insult me.
PSA.69.11	 I wear sackcloth
PSA.69.11	and they ridicule me.
PSA.69.12	 Those who sit at the city gate gossip about me;
PSA.69.12	drunkards mock me in their songs.
PSA.69.13	 O 
PSA.69.13	O God, because of your great loyal love, 
PSA.69.13	answer me with your faithful deliverance!
PSA.69.14	 Rescue me from the mud! Don’t let me sink!
PSA.69.14	Deliver me
PSA.69.14	from the deep water!
PSA.69.15	 Don’t let the current overpower me!
PSA.69.15	Don’t let the deep swallow me up!
PSA.69.15	Don’t let the pit
PSA.69.16	 Answer me, O 
PSA.69.16	Because of your great compassion, turn toward me!
PSA.69.17	 Do not ignore
PSA.69.17	for I am in trouble! Answer me right away!
PSA.69.18	 Come near me and redeem me!
PSA.69.18	Because of my enemies, rescue me!
PSA.69.19	 You know how I am insulted, humiliated and disgraced;
PSA.69.19	you can see all my enemies.
PSA.69.20	 Their insults are painful
PSA.69.20	I look
PSA.69.20	for comforters, but find none.
PSA.69.21	 They put bitter poison
PSA.69.21	and to quench my thirst they give me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	 May their dining table become a trap before them!
PSA.69.22	May it be a snare for that group of friends!
PSA.69.23	 May their eyes be blinded!
PSA.69.23	Make them shake violently!
PSA.69.24	 Pour out your judgment
PSA.69.24	May your raging anger
PSA.69.25	 May their camp become desolate,
PSA.69.25	their tents uninhabited!
PSA.69.26	 For they harass
PSA.69.26	they spread the news about the suffering of those whom you punish.
PSA.69.27	 Hold them accountable for all their sins!
PSA.69.27	Do not vindicate them!
PSA.69.28	 May their names be deleted from the scroll of the living!
PSA.69.28	Do not let their names be listed with the godly!
PSA.69.29	 I am oppressed and suffering!
PSA.69.29	O God, deliver and protect me!
PSA.69.30	 I will sing praises to God’s name!
PSA.69.30	I will magnify him as I give him thanks!
PSA.69.31	 That will please the

PSA.69.34	 Let the heavens and the earth praise him,
PSA.69.34	along with the seas and everything that swims in them!
PSA.69.35	 For God will deliver Zion
PSA.69.35	and rebuild the cities of Judah,
PSA.69.35	and his people
PSA.69.36	 The descendants of his servants will inherit it,
PSA.69.36	and those who are loyal to him
PSA.70.1	 O God, please be willing to rescue me!

PSA.71.3	For you are my high ridge
PSA.71.4	 My God, rescue me from the power
PSA.71.4	from the hand of the cruel oppressor!
PSA.71.5	 For you give me confidence,
PSA.71.5	O 
PSA.71.6	 I have leaned on you since birth;
PSA.71.6	you pulled me
PSA.71.6	I praise you continually.
PSA.71.7	 Many are appalled when they see me,
PSA.71.7	but you are my secure shelter.
PSA.71.8	 I praise you constantly
PSA.71.8	and speak of your splendor all day long.
PSA.71.9	 Do not reject me in my old age!
PSA.71.9	When my strength fails, do not abandon me!
PSA.71.10	 For my enemies talk about me;
PSA.71.10	those waiting for a chance to kill me plot my demise.
PSA.71.11	 They say,

PSA.71.15	 I will tell about your justice,
PSA.71.15	and all day long proclaim your salvation,
PSA.71.15	though I cannot fathom its full extent.
PSA.71.16	 I will come and tell about
PSA.71.16	I will proclaim your justice – yours alone.
PSA.71.17	 O God, you have taught me since I was young,
PSA.71.17	and I am still declaring
PSA.71.18	 Even when I am old and gray,
PSA.71.18	O God, do not abandon me,
PSA.71.18	until I tell the next generation about your strength,
PSA.71.18	and those coming after me about your power.
PSA.71.19	 Your justice, O God, extends to the skies above;
PSA.71.19	you have done great things.
PSA.71.19	O God, who can compare to you?
PSA.71.20	 Though you have allowed me to experience much trouble and distress,

PSA.71.23	I will praise you when you rescue me!
PSA.71.24	 All day long my tongue will also tell about your justice,
PSA.71.24	for those who want to harm me
PSA.72.1	 O God, grant the king the ability to make just decisions!
PSA.72.1	Grant the king’s son
PSA.72.2	 Then he will judge
PSA.72.2	and your oppressed ones
PSA.72.3	 The mountains will bring news of peace to the people,

PSA.72.4	 He will defend

PSA.72.8	 May he rule
PSA.72.8	and from the Euphrates River
PSA.72.9	 Before him the coastlands
PSA.72.9	and his enemies will lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	 The kings of Tarshish
PSA.72.10	the kings of Sheba
PSA.72.11	 All kings will bow down to him;
PSA.72.11	all nations will serve him.

PSA.72.16	May its
PSA.72.16	May its crops
PSA.72.17	 May his fame endure!
PSA.72.17	May his dynasty last as long as the sun remains in the sky!
PSA.72.17	May they use his name when they formulate their blessings!
PSA.72.17	May all nations consider him to be favored by God!
PSA.72.18	 The 
PSA.72.18	He alone accomplishes amazing things!
PSA.72.19	 His glorious name deserves praise
PSA.72.19	May his majestic splendor
PSA.72.19	We agree! We agree!
PSA.72.20	 This collection of the prayers of David son of Jesse ends here.
PSA.73.1	 Certainly God is good to Israel,
PSA.73.1	and to those whose motives are pure!
PSA.73.2	 But as for me, my feet almost slipped;
PSA.73.2	my feet almost slid out from under me.
PSA.73.3	 For I envied those who are proud,
PSA.73.3	as I observed
PSA.73.4	 For they suffer no pain;
PSA.73.4	their bodies
PSA.73.5	 They are immune to the trouble common to men;
PSA.73.5	they do not suffer as other men do.
PSA.73.6	 Arrogance is their necklace,
PSA.73.6	and violence their clothing.
PSA.73.7	 Their prosperity causes them to do wrong;
PSA.73.7	their thoughts are sinful.
PSA.73.8	 They mock
PSA.73.8	they proudly threaten violence.
PSA.73.9	 They speak as if they rule in heaven,
PSA.73.9	and lay claim to the earth.
PSA.73.10	 Therefore they have more than enough food to eat,
PSA.73.10	and even suck up the water of the sea.
PSA.73.11	 They say, “How does God know what we do?
PSA.73.11	Is the sovereign one aware of what goes on?”
PSA.73.12	 Take a good look! This is what the wicked are like,
PSA.73.12	those who always have it so easy and get richer and richer.
PSA.73.13	 I concluded,
PSA.73.13	and maintained a pure lifestyle.
PSA.73.14	 I suffer all day long,
PSA.73.14	and am punished every morning.”
PSA.73.15	 If I had publicized these thoughts,
PSA.73.15	I would have betrayed your loyal followers.
PSA.73.16	 When I tried to make sense of this,
PSA.73.16	it was troubling to me.
PSA.73.17	 Then I entered the precincts of God’s temple,
PSA.73.17	and understood the destiny of the wicked.
PSA.73.18	 Surely
PSA.73.18	you bring them down
PSA.73.19	 How desolate they become in a mere moment!
PSA.73.19	Terrifying judgments make their demise complete!
PSA.73.20	 They are like a dream after one wakes up.
PSA.73.20	O Lord, when you awake
PSA.73.21	 Yes,
PSA.73.21	and my insides felt sharp pain.
PSA.73.22	 I was ignorant
PSA.73.22	I was as senseless as an animal before you.
PSA.73.23	 But I am continually with you;
PSA.73.23	you hold my right hand.
PSA.73.24	 You guide
PSA.73.24	and then you will lead me to a position of honor.
PSA.73.25	 Whom do I have in heaven but you?
PSA.73.25	I desire no one but you on earth.
PSA.73.26	 My flesh and my heart may grow weak,
PSA.73.26	but God always
PSA.73.27	 Yes,
PSA.73.27	you destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you.
PSA.73.28	 But as for me, God’s presence is all I need.
PSA.73.28	I have made the sovereign 
PSA.73.28	as
PSA.74.1	 Why, O God, have you permanently rejected us?
PSA.74.1	Why does your anger burn
PSA.74.2	 Remember your people
PSA.74.2	whom you rescued
PSA.74.2	as well as Mount Zion, where you dwell!
PSA.74.3	 Hurry and look
PSA.74.3	and all the damage the enemy has done to the temple!
PSA.74.4	 Your enemies roar
PSA.74.4	they set up their battle flags.
PSA.74.5	 They invade like lumberjacks
PSA.74.5	swinging their axes in a thick forest.
PSA.74.6	 And now
PSA.74.6	with axes
PSA.74.7	 They set your sanctuary on fire;
PSA.74.7	they desecrate your dwelling place by knocking it to the ground.
PSA.74.8	 They say to themselves,
PSA.74.8	“We will oppress all of them.”
PSA.74.8	They burn down all the places where people worship God in the land.
PSA.74.9	 We do not see any signs of God’s presence;
PSA.74.9	there are no longer any prophets
PSA.74.9	and we have no one to tell us how long this will last.
PSA.74.10	 How long, O God, will the adversary hurl insults?
PSA.74.10	Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
PSA.74.11	 Why do you remain inactive?
PSA.74.11	Intervene and destroy him!
PSA.74.12	 But God has been my
PSA.74.12	performing acts of deliverance on the earth.
PSA.74.13	 You destroyed
PSA.74.13	you shattered the heads of the sea monster
PSA.74.14	 You crushed the heads of Leviathan;
PSA.74.14	you fed
PSA.74.15	 You broke open the spring and the stream;
PSA.74.15	you dried up perpetually flowing rivers.
PSA.74.16	 You established the cycle of day and night;
PSA.74.16	you put the moon
PSA.74.17	 You set up all the boundaries
PSA.74.17	you created the cycle of summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	 Remember how
PSA.74.18	and how a foolish nation blasphemes your name!
PSA.74.19	 Do not hand the life of your dove
PSA.74.19	Do not continue to disregard
PSA.74.20	 Remember your covenant promises,
PSA.74.20	for the dark regions of the earth are full of places where violence rules.
PSA.74.21	 Do not let the afflicted be turned back in shame!
PSA.74.21	Let the oppressed and poor praise your name!
PSA.74.22	 Rise up, O God! Defend your honor!
PSA.74.22	Remember how fools insult you all day long!
PSA.74.23	 Do not disregard
PSA.74.23	or the unceasing shouts of those who defy you.
PSA.75.1	 We give thanks to you, O God! We give thanks!
PSA.75.1	You reveal your presence;
PSA.75.1	people tell about your amazing deeds.
PSA.75.2	 God says,
PSA.75.2	“At the appointed times,
PSA.75.2	I judge
PSA.75.3	 When the earth and all its inhabitants dissolve in fear,
PSA.75.3	I make its pillars secure.”
PSA.75.4	 I say to the proud, “Do not be proud,”
PSA.75.4	and to the wicked, “Do not be so confident of victory!
PSA.75.5	 Do not be so certain you have won!
PSA.75.5	Do not speak with your head held so high!
PSA.75.6	 For victory does not come from the east or west,
PSA.75.6	or from the wilderness.
PSA.75.7	 For God is the judge!
PSA.75.7	He brings one down and exalts another.
PSA.75.8	 For the 
PSA.75.8	of foaming wine mixed with spices,
PSA.75.8	and pours it out.
PSA.75.8	Surely all the wicked of the earth
PSA.75.8	will slurp it up and drink it to its very last drop.”
PSA.75.9	 As for me, I will continually tell what you have done;
PSA.75.9	I will sing praises to the God of Jacob!
PSA.75.10	 God says,
PSA.75.10	“I will bring down all the power of the wicked;
PSA.75.10	the godly will be victorious.”
PSA.76.1	 God has revealed himself in Judah;
PSA.76.1	in Israel his reputation
PSA.76.2	 He lives in Salem;
PSA.76.2	he dwells in Zion.
PSA.76.3	 There he shattered the arrows,
PSA.76.3	the shield, the sword, and the rest of the weapons of war.
PSA.76.4	 You shine brightly and reveal your majesty,
PSA.76.4	as you descend from the hills where you killed your prey.
PSA.76.5	 The bravehearted
PSA.76.5	they “fell asleep.”
PSA.76.5	All the warriors were helpless.
PSA.76.6	 At the sound of your battle cry,
PSA.76.6	both rider
PSA.76.7	 You are awesome! Yes, you!
PSA.76.7	Who can withstand your intense anger?
PSA.76.8	 From heaven you announced what their punishment would be.
PSA.76.8	The earth
PSA.76.9	 when God arose to execute judgment,
PSA.76.9	and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)
PSA.76.10	 Certainly
PSA.76.10	you reveal your anger in full measure.
PSA.76.11	 Make vows to the 
PSA.76.11	Let all those who surround him
PSA.76.12	 He humbles princes;
PSA.76.12	the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.
PSA.77.1	 I will cry out to God
PSA.77.1	I will cry out to God and he will pay attention
PSA.77.2	 In my time of trouble I sought
PSA.77.2	I kept my hand raised in prayer throughout the night.
PSA.77.2	I
PSA.77.3	 I said, “I will remember God while I groan;
PSA.77.3	I will think about him while my strength leaves me.”
PSA.77.4	 You held my eyelids open;
PSA.77.4	I was troubled and could not speak.
PSA.77.5	 I thought about the days of old,
PSA.77.5	about ancient times.
PSA.77.6	 I said, “During the night I will remember the song I once sang;
PSA.77.6	I will think very carefully.”
PSA.77.6	I tried to make sense of what was happening.
PSA.77.7	 I asked,
PSA.77.7	Will he never again show me his favor?
PSA.77.8	 Has his loyal love disappeared forever?
PSA.77.8	Has his promise
PSA.77.9	 Has God forgotten to be merciful?
PSA.77.9	Has his anger stifled his compassion?”
PSA.77.10	 Then I said, “I am sickened by the thought
PSA.77.10	that the sovereign One
PSA.77.11	 I will remember the works of the 
PSA.77.11	Yes, I will remember the amazing things you did long ago!
PSA.77.12	 I will think about all you have done;
PSA.77.12	I will reflect upon your deeds!”
PSA.77.13	 O God, your deeds are extraordinary!
PSA.77.13	What god can compare to our great God?
PSA.77.14	 You are the God who does amazing things;
PSA.77.14	you have revealed your strength among the nations.
PSA.77.15	 You delivered
PSA.77.15	the children of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah)
PSA.77.16	 The waters
PSA.77.16	the waters saw you and trembled.
PSA.77.16	Yes, the depths of the sea
PSA.77.17	 The clouds poured down rain;
PSA.77.17	the skies thundered.
PSA.77.17	Yes, your arrows
PSA.77.18	 Your thunderous voice was heard in the wind;
PSA.77.18	the lightning bolts lit up the world;
PSA.77.18	the earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	 You walked through the sea;
PSA.77.19	you passed through the surging waters,
PSA.77.19	but left no footprints.
PSA.77.20	 You led your people like a flock of sheep,
PSA.77.20	by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	 Pay attention, my people, to my instruction!
PSA.78.1	Listen to the words I speak!
PSA.78.2	 I will sing a song that imparts wisdom;
PSA.78.2	I will make insightful observations about the past.
PSA.78.3	 What we have heard and learned
PSA.78.3	that which our ancestors
PSA.78.4	 we will not hide from their
PSA.78.4	We will tell the next generation
PSA.78.4	about the 
PSA.78.4	about his strength and the amazing things he has done.
PSA.78.5	 He established a rule
PSA.78.5	he set up a law in Israel.
PSA.78.5	He commanded our ancestors
PSA.78.5	to make his deeds known to their descendants,
PSA.78.6	 so that the next generation, children yet to be born,
PSA.78.6	might know about them.
PSA.78.6	They will grow up and tell their descendants about them.
PSA.78.7	 Then they will place their confidence in God.
PSA.78.7	They will not forget the works of God,
PSA.78.7	and they will obey
PSA.78.8	 Then they will not be like their ancestors,
PSA.78.8	who were a stubborn and rebellious generation,
PSA.78.8	a generation that was not committed
PSA.78.8	and faithful to God.
PSA.78.9	 The Ephraimites
PSA.78.9	but they retreated in the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	 They did not keep their covenant with God,
PSA.78.10	and they refused to obey
PSA.78.11	 They forgot what he had done,
PSA.78.11	the amazing things he had shown them.
PSA.78.12	 He did amazing things in the sight of their ancestors,
PSA.78.12	in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
PSA.78.13	 He divided the sea and led them across it;
PSA.78.13	he made the water stand in a heap.
PSA.78.14	 He led them with a cloud by day,
PSA.78.14	and with the light of a fire all night long.
PSA.78.15	 He broke open rocks in the wilderness,
PSA.78.15	and gave them enough water to fill the depths of the sea.
PSA.78.16	 He caused streams to flow from the rock,
PSA.78.16	and made the water flow like rivers.
PSA.78.17	 Yet they continued to sin against him,
PSA.78.17	and rebelled against the sovereign One
PSA.78.18	 They willfully challenged God
PSA.78.18	by asking for food to satisfy their appetite.
PSA.78.19	 They insulted God, saying,
PSA.78.19	“Is God really able to give us food
PSA.78.20	 Yes,
PSA.78.20	streams gushed forth.
PSA.78.20	But can he also give us food?
PSA.78.20	Will he provide meat for his people?”
PSA.78.21	 When
PSA.78.21	A fire broke out against Jacob,
PSA.78.21	and his anger flared up
PSA.78.22	 because they did not have faith in God,
PSA.78.22	and did not trust his ability to deliver them.
PSA.78.23	 He gave a command to the clouds above,
PSA.78.23	and opened the doors in the sky.
PSA.78.24	 He rained down manna for them to eat;
PSA.78.24	he gave them the grain of heaven.
PSA.78.25	 Man ate the food of the mighty ones.
PSA.78.25	He sent them more than enough to eat.
PSA.78.26	 He brought the east wind through the sky,
PSA.78.26	and by his strength led forth the south wind.
PSA.78.27	 He rained down meat on them like dust,
PSA.78.27	birds as numerous as the sand on the seashores.
PSA.78.28	 He caused them to fall right in the middle of their camp,
PSA.78.28	all around their homes.
PSA.78.29	 They ate until they were stuffed;
PSA.78.29	he gave them what they desired.
PSA.78.30	 They were not yet filled up,
PSA.78.30	their food was still in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	 when the anger of God flared up against them.
PSA.78.31	He killed some of the strongest of them;
PSA.78.31	he brought the young men of Israel to their knees.
PSA.78.32	 Despite all this, they continued to sin,
PSA.78.32	and did not trust him to do amazing things.
PSA.78.33	 So he caused them to die unsatisfied
PSA.78.33	and filled with terror.
PSA.78.34	 When he struck them down,
PSA.78.34	they turned back and longed for God.
PSA.78.35	 They remembered that God was their protector,
PSA.78.35	and that the sovereign God was their deliverer.
PSA.78.36	 But they deceived him with their words,
PSA.78.36	and lied to him.
PSA.78.37	 They were not really committed to him,
PSA.78.37	and they were unfaithful to his covenant.
PSA.78.38	 Yet he is compassionate.
PSA.78.38	He forgives sin and does not destroy.
PSA.78.38	He often holds back his anger,
PSA.78.38	and does not stir up his fury.
PSA.78.39	 He remembered
PSA.78.39	and were like a wind that blows past and does not return.
PSA.78.40	 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,
PSA.78.40	and insulted him
PSA.78.41	 They again challenged God,
PSA.78.41	and offended
PSA.78.42	 They did not remember what he had done,
PSA.78.42	how he delivered them from the enemy,
PSA.78.43	 when he performed his awesome deeds
PSA.78.43	and his acts of judgment
PSA.78.44	 He turned their rivers into blood,
PSA.78.44	and they could not drink from their streams.
PSA.78.45	 He sent swarms of biting insects against them,
PSA.78.45	as well as frogs that overran their land.
PSA.78.46	 He gave their crops to the grasshopper,
PSA.78.46	the fruit of their labor to the locust.
PSA.78.47	 He destroyed their vines with hail,
PSA.78.47	and their sycamore-fig trees with driving rain.
PSA.78.48	 He rained hail down on their cattle,
PSA.78.48	and hurled lightning bolts down on their livestock.
PSA.78.49	 His raging anger lashed out against them,
PSA.78.49	He sent fury, rage, and trouble
PSA.78.49	as messengers who bring disaster.
PSA.78.50	 He sent his anger in full force;
PSA.78.50	he did not spare them from death;
PSA.78.50	he handed their lives over to destruction.
PSA.78.51	 He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt,
PSA.78.51	the firstfruits of their reproductive power
PSA.78.52	 Yet he brought out his people like sheep;
PSA.78.52	he led them through the wilderness like a flock.
PSA.78.53	 He guided them safely along,
PSA.78.53	while the sea covered their enemies.
PSA.78.54	 He brought them to the border of his holy land,
PSA.78.54	to this mountainous land
PSA.78.55	 He drove the nations out from before them;
PSA.78.55	he assigned them their tribal allotments
PSA.78.55	and allowed the tribes of Israel to settle down.
PSA.78.56	 Yet they challenged and defied
PSA.78.56	and did not obey
PSA.78.57	 They were unfaithful
PSA.78.57	they were as unreliable as a malfunctioning bow.
PSA.78.58	 They made him angry with their pagan shrines,
PSA.78.58	and made him jealous with their idols.
PSA.78.59	 God heard and was angry;
PSA.78.59	he completely rejected Israel.
PSA.78.60	 He abandoned
PSA.78.60	the tent where he lived among men.
PSA.78.61	 He allowed the symbol of his strong presence to be captured;
PSA.78.61	he gave the symbol of his splendor
PSA.78.62	 He delivered his people over to the sword,
PSA.78.62	and was angry with his chosen nation.
PSA.78.63	 Fire consumed their
PSA.78.63	and their
PSA.78.64	 Their
PSA.78.64	but their
PSA.78.65	 But then the Lord awoke from his sleep;
PSA.78.65	he was like a warrior in a drunken rage.
PSA.78.66	 He drove his enemies back;
PSA.78.66	he made them a permanent target for insults.
PSA.78.67	 He rejected the tent of Joseph;
PSA.78.67	he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
PSA.78.68	 He chose the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	and Mount Zion, which he loves.
PSA.78.69	 He made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavens above;
PSA.78.69	as secure as the earth, which he established permanently.
PSA.78.70	 He chose David, his servant,
PSA.78.70	and took him from the sheepfolds.
PSA.78.71	 He took him away from following the mother sheep,
PSA.78.71	and made him the shepherd of Jacob, his people,
PSA.78.71	and of Israel, his chosen nation.
PSA.78.72	 David
PSA.78.72	he led them with skill.
PSA.79.1	 O God, foreigners
PSA.79.1	they have polluted your holy temple
PSA.79.1	and turned Jerusalem
PSA.79.2	 They have given the corpses of your servants
PSA.79.2	to the birds of the sky;
PSA.79.2	the flesh of your loyal followers
PSA.79.2	to the beasts of the earth.
PSA.79.3	 They have made their blood flow like water
PSA.79.3	all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury them.
PSA.79.4	 We have become an object of disdain to our neighbors;
PSA.79.4	those who live on our borders taunt and insult us.
PSA.79.5	 How long will this go on, O 
PSA.79.5	Will you stay angry forever?
PSA.79.5	How long will your rage
PSA.79.6	 Pour out your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you,
PSA.79.6	on the kingdoms that do not pray to you!
PSA.79.7	 For they have devoured Jacob
PSA.79.7	and destroyed his home.
PSA.79.8	 Do not hold us accountable for the sins of earlier generations!
PSA.79.8	Quickly send your compassion our way,
PSA.79.8	for we are in serious trouble!
PSA.79.9	 Help us, O God, our deliverer!
PSA.79.9	For the sake of your glorious reputation,
PSA.79.9	Forgive our sins for the sake of your reputation!
PSA.79.10	 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
PSA.79.10	Before our very eyes may the shed blood of your servants
PSA.79.10	be avenged among the nations!
PSA.79.11	 Listen to the painful cries of the prisoners!
PSA.79.11	Use your great strength to set free those condemned to die!
PSA.79.12	 Pay back our neighbors in full!
PSA.79.12	May they be insulted the same way they insulted you, O Lord!
PSA.79.13	 Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture,
PSA.79.13	will continually thank you.
PSA.79.13	We will tell coming generations of your praiseworthy acts.
PSA.80.1	 O shepherd of Israel, pay attention,
PSA.80.1	you who lead Joseph like a flock of sheep!
PSA.80.1	You who sit enthroned above the winged angels,
PSA.80.2	 In the sight of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh reveal
PSA.80.2	Come and deliver us!
PSA.80.3	 O God, restore us!
PSA.80.3	Smile on us!
PSA.80.4	 O 
PSA.80.4	How long will you remain angry at your people while they pray to you?
PSA.80.5	 You have given them tears as food;
PSA.80.5	you have made them drink tears by the measure.
PSA.80.6	 You have made our neighbors dislike us,
PSA.80.6	and our enemies insult us.
PSA.80.7	 O God, invincible warrior,
PSA.80.7	Smile on us!
PSA.80.8	 You uprooted a vine
PSA.80.8	you drove out nations and transplanted it.
PSA.80.9	 You cleared the ground for it;
PSA.80.9	it took root,
PSA.80.9	and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	 The mountains were covered by its shadow,
PSA.80.10	the highest cedars
PSA.80.11	 Its branches reached the Mediterranean Sea,
PSA.80.11	and its shoots the Euphrates River.
PSA.80.12	 Why did you break down its walls,
PSA.80.12	so that all who pass by pluck its fruit?
PSA.80.13	 The wild boars of the forest ruin it;
PSA.80.13	the insects
PSA.80.14	 O God, invincible warrior,
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven and take notice!
PSA.80.14	Take care of this vine,
PSA.80.15	 the root
PSA.80.15	the shoot you made to grow!
PSA.80.16	 It is burned
PSA.80.16	They die because you are displeased with them.
PSA.80.17	 May you give support to the one you have chosen,
PSA.80.17	to the one whom you raised up for yourself!
PSA.80.18	 Then we will not turn away from you.
PSA.80.18	Revive us and we will pray to you!
PSA.80.19	 O 
PSA.80.19	Smile on us!
PSA.81.1	 Shout for joy to God, our source of strength!
PSA.81.1	Shout out to the God of Jacob!
PSA.81.2	 Sing
PSA.81.2	the pleasant sounding harp, and the ten-stringed instrument!
PSA.81.3	 Sound the ram’s horn on the day of the new moon,
PSA.81.3	and on the day of the full moon when our festival begins.
PSA.81.4	 For observing the festival is a requirement for Israel;
PSA.81.4	it is an ordinance given by the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	 He decreed it as a regulation in Joseph,
PSA.81.5	when he attacked the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.5	I heard a voice I did not recognize.
PSA.81.6	 It said:
PSA.81.6	his hands were released from holding the basket.
PSA.81.7	 In your distress you called out and I rescued you.
PSA.81.7	I answered you from a dark thundercloud.
PSA.81.7	I tested you at the waters of Meribah.
PSA.81.8	 I said,
PSA.81.8	I will warn
PSA.81.8	O Israel, if only you would obey me!
PSA.81.9	 There must be
PSA.81.9	You must not worship a foreign god.
PSA.81.10	 I am the 
PSA.81.10	the one who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth wide and I will fill it!’
PSA.81.11	 But my people did not obey me;
PSA.81.11	Israel did not submit to me.
PSA.81.12	 I gave them over to their stubborn desires;
PSA.81.12	they did what seemed right to them.
PSA.81.13	 If only my people would obey me!
PSA.81.13	If only Israel would keep my commands!
PSA.81.14	 Then I would quickly subdue their enemies,
PSA.81.14	and attack
PSA.81.15	 (May those who hate the 
PSA.81.15	May they be permanently humiliated!)
PSA.81.16	 “I would feed Israel the best wheat,
PSA.81.16	and would satisfy your appetite
PSA.82.1	 God stands in
PSA.82.1	in the midst of the gods
PSA.82.2	 He says,
PSA.82.2	and show favoritism to the wicked?
PSA.82.3	 Defend the cause of the poor and the fatherless!
PSA.82.3	Vindicate the oppressed and suffering!
PSA.82.4	 Rescue the poor and needy!
PSA.82.4	Deliver them from the power
PSA.82.5	 They
PSA.82.5	They stumble
PSA.82.5	while all the foundations of the earth crumble.
PSA.82.6	 I thought,
PSA.82.6	all of you are sons of the Most High.’
PSA.82.7	 Yet you will die like mortals;
PSA.82.7	you will fall like all the other rulers.”
PSA.82.8	 Rise up, O God, and execute judgment on the earth!
PSA.82.8	For you own
PSA.83.1	 O God, do not be silent!
PSA.83.1	Do not ignore us!
PSA.83.2	 For look, your enemies are making a commotion;
PSA.83.2	those who hate you are hostile.
PSA.83.3	 They carefully plot
PSA.83.3	and make plans to harm
PSA.83.4	 They say, “Come on, let’s annihilate them so they are no longer a nation!
PSA.83.4	Then the name of Israel will be remembered no more.”
PSA.83.5	 Yes,
PSA.83.5	they form an alliance
PSA.83.6	 It includes
PSA.83.6	Moab and the Hagrites,
PSA.83.7	 Gebal,
PSA.83.7	Philistia and the inhabitants of Tyre.
PSA.83.8	 Even Assyria has allied with them,
PSA.83.8	lending its strength to the descendants of Lot.
PSA.83.9	 Do to them as you did to Midian
PSA.83.9	as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River!
PSA.83.10	 They were destroyed at Endor;
PSA.83.10	their corpses were like manure
PSA.83.11	 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
PSA.83.11	and all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna,
PSA.83.12	 who said,
PSA.83.13	 O my God, make them like dead thistles,
PSA.83.13	like dead weeds blown away by
PSA.83.14	 Like the fire that burns down the forest,
PSA.83.14	or the flames that consume the mountainsides,
PSA.83.15	 chase them with your gale winds,
PSA.83.15	and terrify
PSA.83.16	 Cover
PSA.83.16	so they might seek
PSA.83.17	 May they be humiliated and continually terrified!
PSA.83.17	May they die in shame!
PSA.83.18	 Then they will know
PSA.83.18	the sovereign king
PSA.84.1	 How lovely is the place where you live,
PSA.84.1	O 
PSA.84.2	 I desperately want to be
PSA.84.2	in the courts of the 
PSA.84.2	My heart and my entire being
PSA.84.2	to the living God.
PSA.84.3	 Even the birds find a home there,
PSA.84.3	and the swallow
PSA.84.3	where she can protect her young
PSA.84.3	near your altars, O 
PSA.84.3	my king and my God.
PSA.84.4	 How blessed
PSA.84.4	and praise you continually! (Selah)
PSA.84.5	 How blessed are those who
PSA.84.5	and long to travel the roads that lead to your temple!
PSA.84.6	 As they pass through the Baca Valley,
PSA.84.6	he provides a spring for them.
PSA.84.6	The rain
PSA.84.7	 They are sustained as they travel along;
PSA.84.7	each one appears
PSA.84.8	 O 
PSA.84.8	hear my prayer!
PSA.84.8	Listen, O God of Jacob! (Selah)
PSA.84.9	 O God, take notice of our shield!
PSA.84.9	Show concern for your chosen king!
PSA.84.10	 Certainly
PSA.84.10	than spending a thousand elsewhere.
PSA.84.10	I would rather stand at the entrance
PSA.84.10	than live
PSA.84.11	 For the 
PSA.84.11	The 
PSA.84.11	he withholds no good thing from those who have integrity.
PSA.84.12	 O 
PSA.84.12	how blessed are those who trust in you!
PSA.85.1	 O 
PSA.85.1	you restored the well-being of Jacob.
PSA.85.2	 You pardoned
PSA.85.2	you forgave
PSA.85.3	 You withdrew all your fury;
PSA.85.3	you turned back from your raging anger.
PSA.85.4	 Restore us, O God our deliverer!
PSA.85.4	Do not be displeased with us!
PSA.85.5	 Will you stay mad at us forever?
PSA.85.5	Will you remain angry throughout future generations?
PSA.85.6	 Will you not revive us once more?
PSA.85.6	Then your people will rejoice in you!
PSA.85.7	 O 
PSA.85.7	Bestow on us your deliverance!
PSA.85.8	 I will listen to what God the 
PSA.85.8	For he will make
PSA.85.8	Yet they must not
PSA.85.9	 Certainly his loyal followers will soon experience his deliverance;
PSA.85.9	then his splendor will again appear in our land.
PSA.85.10	 Loyal love and faithfulness meet;
PSA.85.10	deliverance and peace greet each other with a kiss.
PSA.85.11	 Faithfulness grows from the ground,
PSA.85.11	and deliverance looks down from the sky.
PSA.85.12	 Yes, the 
PSA.85.12	and our land will yield
PSA.85.13	 Deliverance goes
PSA.85.13	and prepares
PSA.86.1	 Listen
PSA.86.1	For I am oppressed and needy.
PSA.86.2	 Protect me,
PSA.86.2	O my God, deliver your servant, who trusts in you!
PSA.86.3	 Have mercy on me,
PSA.86.3	for I cry out to you all day long!
PSA.86.4	 Make your servant
PSA.86.4	for to you, O Lord, I pray!
PSA.86.5	 Certainly
PSA.86.5	and show great faithfulness to all who cry out to you.
PSA.86.6	 O 
PSA.86.6	Pay attention to my plea for mercy!
PSA.86.7	 In my time of trouble I cry out to you,
PSA.86.7	for you will answer me.
PSA.86.8	 None can compare to you among the gods, O Lord!
PSA.86.8	Your exploits are incomparable!
PSA.86.9	 All the nations, whom you created,
PSA.86.9	will come and worship you,
PSA.86.9	They will honor your name.
PSA.86.10	 For you are great and do amazing things.
PSA.86.10	You alone are God.
PSA.86.11	 O 
PSA.86.11	Then I will obey your commands.
PSA.86.11	Make me wholeheartedly committed to you!
PSA.86.12	 O Lord, my God, I will give you thanks with my whole heart!
PSA.86.12	I will honor your name continually!
PSA.86.13	 For you will extend your great loyal love to me,
PSA.86.13	and will deliver my life
PSA.86.14	 O God, arrogant men attack me;
PSA.86.14	a gang
PSA.86.15	 But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God.
PSA.86.15	You are patient
PSA.86.16	 Turn toward me and have mercy on me!
PSA.86.16	Give your servant your strength!
PSA.86.16	Deliver your slave!
PSA.86.17	 Show me evidence of your favor!
PSA.86.17	Then those who hate me will see it and be ashamed,
PSA.86.17	for you, O 
PSA.87.1	 The 
PSA.87.2	 The 
PSA.87.2	more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.
PSA.87.3	 People say wonderful things about you,
PSA.87.3	O city of God. (Selah)
PSA.87.4	 I mention Rahab
PSA.87.4	Here are
PSA.87.4	It is said of them, “This one was born there.”
PSA.87.5	 But it is said of Zion’s residents,
PSA.87.5	“Each one of these
PSA.87.5	and the sovereign One
PSA.87.6	 The 
PSA.87.6	“This one was born there.”
PSA.87.7	 As for the singers, as well as the pipers – 
PSA.87.7	all of them sing within your walls.
PSA.88.1	 O 
PSA.88.1	By day I cry out
PSA.88.1	and at night I pray before you.
PSA.88.2	 Listen to my prayer!
PSA.88.2	Pay attention
PSA.88.3	 For my life
PSA.88.3	and I am ready to enter Sheol.
PSA.88.4	 They treat me like
PSA.88.4	I am like a helpless man,
PSA.88.5	 adrift
PSA.88.5	like corpses lying in the grave,
PSA.88.5	whom you remember no more,
PSA.88.5	and who are cut off from your power.
PSA.88.6	 You place me in the lowest regions of the pit,
PSA.88.6	in the dark places, in the watery depths.
PSA.88.7	 Your anger bears down on me,
PSA.88.7	and you overwhelm me with all your waves. (Selah)
PSA.88.8	 You cause those who know me to keep their distance;
PSA.88.8	you make me an appalling sight to them.
PSA.88.8	I am trapped and cannot get free.
PSA.88.9	 My eyes grow weak because of oppression.
PSA.88.9	I call out to you, O 
PSA.88.9	I spread out my hands in prayer to you.
PSA.88.10	 Do you accomplish amazing things for the dead?
PSA.88.10	Do the departed spirits
PSA.88.11	 Is your loyal love proclaimed in the grave,
PSA.88.11	or your faithfulness in the place of the dead?
PSA.88.12	 Are your amazing deeds experienced
PSA.88.12	or your deliverance in the land of oblivion?
PSA.88.13	 As for me, I cry out to you, O 
PSA.88.13	in the morning my prayer confronts you.
PSA.88.14	 O 
PSA.88.14	and pay no attention to me?
PSA.88.15	 I am oppressed and have been on the verge of death since my youth.
PSA.88.15	I have been subjected to your horrors and am numb with pain.
PSA.88.16	 Your anger overwhelms me;
PSA.88.16	your terrors destroy me.
PSA.88.17	 They surround me like water all day long;
PSA.88.17	they join forces and encircle me.
PSA.88.18	 You cause my friends and neighbors to keep their distance;
PSA.88.18	those who know me leave me alone in the darkness.
PSA.89.1	 I will sing continually
PSA.89.1	to future generations I will proclaim your faithfulness.
PSA.89.2	 For I say, “Loyal love is permanently established;
PSA.89.2	in the skies you set up your faithfulness.”
PSA.89.3	 The 
PSA.89.3	“I have made a covenant with my chosen one;
PSA.89.3	I have made a promise on oath to David, my servant:
PSA.89.4	 ‘I will give you an eternal dynasty
PSA.89.4	and establish your throne throughout future generations.’”
PSA.89.5	 O 
PSA.89.5	as well as your faithfulness in the angelic assembly.
PSA.89.6	 For who in the skies can compare to the 
PSA.89.6	Who is like the 
PSA.89.7	 a God who is honored
PSA.89.7	and more awesome than
PSA.89.8	 O 
PSA.89.8	Who is strong like you, O 
PSA.89.8	Your faithfulness surrounds you.
PSA.89.9	 You rule over the proud sea.
PSA.89.9	When its waves surge,
PSA.89.10	 You crushed the Proud One
PSA.89.10	with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.
PSA.89.11	 The heavens belong to you, as does the earth.
PSA.89.11	You made the world and all it contains.
PSA.89.12	 You created the north and the south.
PSA.89.12	Tabor and Hermon
PSA.89.13	 Your arm is powerful,
PSA.89.13	your hand strong,
PSA.89.13	your right hand
PSA.89.14	 Equity and justice are the foundation of your throne.
PSA.89.14	Loyal love and faithfulness characterize your rule.
PSA.89.15	 How blessed are the people who worship you!
PSA.89.15	O 
PSA.89.16	 They rejoice in your name all day long,
PSA.89.16	and are vindicated
PSA.89.17	 For you give them splendor and strength.
PSA.89.17	By your favor we are victorious.
PSA.89.18	 For our shield
PSA.89.18	our king to the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.89.19	 Then you
PSA.89.19	“I have energized a warrior;
PSA.89.19	I have raised up a young man
PSA.89.20	 I have discovered David, my servant.
PSA.89.20	With my holy oil I have anointed him as king.
PSA.89.21	 My hand will support him,
PSA.89.21	and my arm will strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	 No enemy will be able to exact tribute
PSA.89.22	a violent oppressor will not be able to humiliate him.
PSA.89.23	 I will crush his enemies before him;
PSA.89.23	I will strike down those who hate him.
PSA.89.24	 He will experience my faithfulness and loyal love,
PSA.89.24	and by my name he will win victories.
PSA.89.25	 I will place his hand over the sea,
PSA.89.25	his right hand over the rivers.
PSA.89.26	 He will call out to me,
PSA.89.26	‘You are my father,
PSA.89.27	 I will appoint him to be my firstborn son,
PSA.89.27	the most exalted of the earth’s kings.
PSA.89.28	 I will always extend my loyal love to him,
PSA.89.28	and my covenant with him is secure.
PSA.89.29	 I will give him an eternal dynasty,
PSA.89.29	and make his throne as enduring as the skies above.
PSA.89.30	 If his sons reject my law
PSA.89.30	and disobey my regulations,
PSA.89.31	 if they break
PSA.89.31	and do not keep my commandments,
PSA.89.32	 I will punish their rebellion by beating them with a club,
PSA.89.32	their sin by inflicting them with bruises.
PSA.89.33	 But I will not remove
PSA.89.33	nor be unfaithful to my promise.
PSA.89.34	 I will not break
PSA.89.34	or go back on what I promised.
PSA.89.35	 Once and for all I have vowed by my own holiness,
PSA.89.35	I will never deceive
PSA.89.36	 His dynasty will last forever.
PSA.89.36	His throne will endure before me, like the sun,
PSA.89.37	 it will remain stable, like the moon,
PSA.89.37	his throne will endure like the skies.”
PSA.89.38	 But you have spurned
PSA.89.38	you are angry with your chosen king.
PSA.89.39	 You have repudiated
PSA.89.39	you have thrown his crown to the ground.
PSA.89.40	 You have broken down all his
PSA.89.40	you have made his strongholds a heap of ruins.
PSA.89.41	 All who pass by
PSA.89.41	he has become an object of disdain to his neighbors.
PSA.89.42	 You have allowed his adversaries to be victorious,
PSA.89.42	and all his enemies to rejoice.
PSA.89.43	 You turn back
PSA.89.43	and have not sustained him in battle.
PSA.89.44	 You have brought to an end his splendor,
PSA.89.44	and have knocked
PSA.89.45	 You have cut short his youth,
PSA.89.45	and have covered him with shame. (Selah)
PSA.89.46	 How long, O 
PSA.89.46	Will you remain hidden forever?
PSA.89.46	Will your anger continue to burn like fire?
PSA.89.47	 Take note of my brief lifespan!
PSA.89.47	Why do you make all people so mortal?
PSA.89.48	 No man can live on without experiencing death,
PSA.89.48	or deliver his life from the power of Sheol.
PSA.89.49	 Where are your earlier faithful deeds,
PSA.89.49	the ones performed in accordance with your reliable oath to David?
PSA.89.50	 Take note, O Lord,
PSA.89.50	and of how I must bear so many insults from people!
PSA.89.51	 Your enemies, O 
PSA.89.51	they insult your chosen king as they dog his footsteps.
PSA.89.52	 The 
PSA.89.52	We agree! We agree!
PSA.90.1	 O Lord, you have been our protector
PSA.90.2	 Even before the mountains came into existence,
PSA.90.2	or you brought the world into being,
PSA.90.2	you were the eternal God.
PSA.90.3	 You make mankind return
PSA.90.3	and say, “Return, O people!”
PSA.90.4	 Yes,
PSA.90.4	are like yesterday that quickly passes,
PSA.90.4	or like one of the divisions of the nighttime.
PSA.90.5	 You bring their lives to an end and they “fall asleep.”
PSA.90.5	In the morning they are like the grass that sprouts up;
PSA.90.6	 in the morning it glistens
PSA.90.6	at evening time it withers
PSA.90.7	 Yes,
PSA.90.7	we are terrified by your wrath.
PSA.90.8	 You are aware of our sins;
PSA.90.8	you even know about our hidden sins.
PSA.90.9	 Yes,
PSA.90.9	the years of our lives pass quickly, like a sigh.
PSA.90.10	 The days of our lives add up to seventy years,
PSA.90.10	or eighty, if one is especially strong.
PSA.90.10	But even one’s best years are marred by trouble and oppression.
PSA.90.10	Yes,
PSA.90.11	 Who can really fathom the intensity of your anger?
PSA.90.11	Your raging fury causes people to fear you.
PSA.90.12	 So teach us to consider our mortality,
PSA.90.12	so that we might live wisely.
PSA.90.13	 Turn back toward us, O 
PSA.90.13	How long must this suffering last?
PSA.90.13	Have pity on your servants!
PSA.90.14	 Satisfy us in the morning
PSA.90.14	Then we will shout for joy and be happy
PSA.90.15	 Make us happy in proportion to the days you have afflicted us,
PSA.90.15	in proportion to the years we have experienced
PSA.90.16	 May your servants see your work!
PSA.90.16	May their sons see your majesty!
PSA.90.17	 May our sovereign God extend his favor to us!
PSA.90.17	Make our endeavors successful!
PSA.90.17	Yes, make them successful!
PSA.91.1	 As for you, the one who lives
PSA.91.1	and resides in the protective shadow
PSA.91.2	 I say this about the 
PSA.91.2	my God in whom I trust – 
PSA.91.3	 he will certainly rescue you from the snare of the hunter
PSA.91.3	and from the destructive plague.
PSA.91.4	 He will shelter you
PSA.91.4	you will find safety under his wings.
PSA.91.4	His faithfulness is like a shield or a protective wall.
PSA.91.5	 You need not fear the terrors of the night,
PSA.91.5	the arrow that flies by day,
PSA.91.6	 the plague that comes in the darkness,
PSA.91.6	or the disease that comes at noon.
PSA.91.7	 Though a thousand may fall beside you,
PSA.91.7	and a multitude on your right side,
PSA.91.7	it
PSA.91.8	 Certainly you will see it with your very own eyes – 
PSA.91.8	you will see the wicked paid back.
PSA.91.9	 For you have taken refuge in the 
PSA.91.9	my shelter, the sovereign One.
PSA.91.10	 No harm will overtake
PSA.91.10	no illness
PSA.91.11	 For he will order his angels
PSA.91.11	to protect you in all you do.
PSA.91.12	 They will lift you up in their hands,
PSA.91.12	so you will not slip and fall on a stone.
PSA.91.13	 You will subdue
PSA.91.13	you will trample underfoot a young lion and a serpent.
PSA.91.14	 The 
PSA.91.14	“Because he is devoted to me, I will deliver him;
PSA.91.14	I will protect him
PSA.91.15	 When he calls out to me, I will answer him.
PSA.91.15	I will be with him when he is in trouble;
PSA.91.15	I will rescue him and bring him honor.
PSA.91.16	 I will satisfy him with long life,
PSA.91.16	and will let him see my salvation.
PSA.92.1	 It is fitting
PSA.92.1	and to sing praises to your name, O sovereign One!
PSA.92.2	 It is fitting
PSA.92.2	and your faithfulness during the night,
PSA.92.3	 to the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument and a lyre,
PSA.92.3	to the accompaniment of the meditative tone of the harp.
PSA.92.4	 For you, O 
PSA.92.4	I will sing for joy because of what you have done.
PSA.92.5	 How great are your works, O 
PSA.92.5	Your plans are very intricate!
PSA.92.6	 The spiritually insensitive do not recognize this;
PSA.92.6	the fool does not understand this.
PSA.92.7	 When the wicked sprout up like grass,
PSA.92.7	and all the evildoers glisten,
PSA.92.7	it is so that they may be annihilated.
PSA.92.8	 But you, O 
PSA.92.9	 Indeed,
PSA.92.9	Indeed,
PSA.92.9	All the evildoers are scattered!
PSA.92.10	 You exalt my horn like that of a wild ox.
PSA.92.10	I am covered
PSA.92.11	 I gloat in triumph over those who tried to ambush me;
PSA.92.11	I hear the defeated cries of the evil foes who attacked me.
PSA.92.12	 The godly
PSA.92.12	they grow high like a cedar in Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	 Planted in the 
PSA.92.13	they grow in the courts of our God.
PSA.92.14	 They bear fruit even when they are old;
PSA.92.14	they are filled with vitality and have many leaves.
PSA.92.15	 So they proclaim that the 
PSA.92.15	is just and never unfair.
PSA.93.1	 The 
PSA.93.1	He is robed in majesty,
PSA.93.1	the 
PSA.93.1	he wears strength around his waist.
PSA.93.1	Indeed, the world is established, it cannot be moved.
PSA.93.2	 Your throne has been secure from ancient times;
PSA.93.2	you have always been king.
PSA.93.3	 The waves
PSA.93.3	the waves roar,
PSA.93.3	the waves roar and crash.
PSA.93.4	 Above the sound of the surging water,
PSA.93.4	and the mighty waves of the sea,
PSA.93.4	the 
PSA.93.5	 The rules you set down
PSA.93.5	Holiness
PSA.94.1	 O 
PSA.94.1	O God who avenges, reveal your splendor!
PSA.94.2	 Rise up, O judge of the earth!
PSA.94.2	Pay back the proud!
PSA.94.3	 O 
PSA.94.3	how long will the wicked celebrate?
PSA.94.4	 They spew out threats
PSA.94.4	all the evildoers boast.
PSA.94.5	 O 
PSA.94.5	they oppress the nation that belongs to you.
PSA.94.6	 They kill the widow and the one residing outside his native land,
PSA.94.6	and they murder the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	 Then they say, “The 
PSA.94.7	the God of Jacob does not take notice of it.”
PSA.94.8	 Take notice of this,
PSA.94.8	You fools, when will you ever understand?
PSA.94.9	 Does the one who makes the human ear not hear?
PSA.94.9	Does the one who forms the human eye not see?
PSA.94.10	 Does the one who disciplines the nations not punish?
PSA.94.10	He is the one who imparts knowledge to human beings!
PSA.94.11	 The 
PSA.94.11	peoples’ thoughts are morally bankrupt.
PSA.94.12	 How blessed is the one
PSA.94.12	the one whom you teach from your law,
PSA.94.13	 in order to protect him from times of trouble,
PSA.94.13	until the wicked are destroyed.
PSA.94.14	 Certainly
PSA.94.14	he does not abandon the nation that belongs to him.
PSA.94.15	 For justice will prevail,
PSA.94.15	and all the morally upright
PSA.94.16	 Who will rise up to defend me
PSA.94.16	Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?
PSA.94.17	 If the 
PSA.94.17	I would have laid down in the silence of death.
PSA.94.18	 If I say, “My foot is slipping,”
PSA.94.18	your loyal love, O 
PSA.94.19	 When worries threaten to overwhelm me,
PSA.94.19	your soothing touch makes me happy.
PSA.94.20	 Cruel rulers
PSA.94.20	those who make oppressive laws.
PSA.94.21	 They conspire against
PSA.94.21	and condemn to death the innocent.

PSA.106.13	 They quickly forgot what he had done;
PSA.106.13	they did not wait for his instructions.
PSA.106.14	 In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving
PSA.106.14	they challenged God
PSA.106.15	 He granted their request,
PSA.106.15	then struck them with a disease.
PSA.106.16	 In the camp they resented
PSA.106.16	and Aaron, the 
PSA.106.17	 The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;
PSA.106.17	it engulfed
PSA.106.18	 Fire burned their group;
PSA.106.18	the flames scorched the wicked.
PSA.106.19	 They made an image of a calf at Horeb,
PSA.106.19	and worshiped a metal idol.
PSA.106.20	 They traded their majestic God
PSA.106.20	for the image of an ox that eats grass.
PSA.106.21	 They rejected
PSA.106.21	the one who performed great deeds in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	 amazing feats in the land of Ham,
PSA.106.22	mighty
PSA.106.23	 He threatened
PSA.106.23	but
PSA.106.23	and turned back his destructive anger.
PSA.106.24	 They rejected the fruitful land;
PSA.106.24	they did not believe his promise.
PSA.106.25	 They grumbled in their tents;
PSA.106.25	they did not obey
PSA.106.26	 So he made a solemn vow
PSA.106.26	that he would make them die
PSA.106.27	 make their descendants
PSA.106.27	and scatter them among foreign lands.
PSA.106.28	 They worshiped
PSA.106.28	and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
PSA.106.29	 They made the 
PSA.106.29	and a plague broke out among them.
PSA.106.30	 Phinehas took a stand and intervened,
PSA.106.30	and the plague subsided.
PSA.106.31	 This brought him a reward,
PSA.106.31	an eternal gift.
PSA.106.32	 They made him angry by the waters of Meribah,
PSA.106.32	and Moses suffered
PSA.106.33	 for they aroused
PSA.106.33	and he spoke rashly.
PSA.106.34	 They did not destroy the nations,
PSA.106.34	as the 
PSA.106.35	 They mixed in with the nations
PSA.106.35	and learned their ways.
PSA.106.36	 They worshiped
PSA.106.36	which became a snare to them.
PSA.106.37	 They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
PSA.106.38	 They shed innocent blood – 
PSA.106.38	the blood of their sons and daughters,
PSA.106.38	whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.
PSA.106.38	The land was polluted by bloodshed.
PSA.106.39	 They were defiled by their deeds,
PSA.106.39	and unfaithful in their actions.
PSA.106.40	 So the 
PSA.106.40	and despised the people who belong to him.
PSA.106.41	 He handed them over to
PSA.106.41	and those who hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	 Their enemies oppressed them;
PSA.106.42	they were subject to their authority.
PSA.106.43	 Many times he delivered
PSA.106.43	but they had a rebellious attitude,
PSA.106.43	and degraded themselves
PSA.106.44	 Yet he took notice of their distress,
PSA.106.44	when he heard their cry for help.
PSA.106.45	 He remembered his covenant with them,
PSA.106.45	and relented
PSA.106.46	 He caused all their conquerors
PSA.106.46	to have pity on them.
PSA.106.47	 Deliver us, O 
PSA.106.47	Gather us from among the nations!
PSA.106.47	Then we will give thanks
PSA.106.47	and boast about your praiseworthy deeds.
PSA.106.48	 The 
PSA.106.48	in the future and forevermore.
PSA.106.48	Let all the people say, “We agree!
PSA.107.1	 Give thanks to the 
PSA.107.1	and his loyal love endures!
PSA.107.2	 Let those delivered by the 
PSA.107.2	those whom he delivered
PSA.107.3	 and gathered from foreign lands,
PSA.107.3	from east and west,
PSA.107.3	from north and south.
PSA.107.4	 They wandered through the wilderness on a desert road;
PSA.107.4	they found no city in which to live.
PSA.107.5	 They were hungry and thirsty;
PSA.107.5	they fainted from exhaustion.
PSA.107.6	 They cried out to the 
PSA.107.6	he delivered them from their troubles.
PSA.107.7	 He led them on a level road,
PSA.107.7	that they might find a city in which to live.
PSA.107.8	 Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.8	and for the amazing things he has done for people!
PSA.107.9	 For he has satisfied those who thirst,
PSA.107.9	and those who hunger he has filled with food.
PSA.107.10	 They sat in utter darkness,
PSA.107.10	bound in painful iron chains,
PSA.107.11	 because they had rebelled against God’s commands,
PSA.107.11	and rejected the instructions of the sovereign king.
PSA.107.12	 So he used suffering to humble them;
PSA.107.12	they stumbled and no one helped them up.
PSA.107.13	 They cried out to the 
PSA.107.13	he delivered them from their troubles.
PSA.107.14	 He brought them out of the utter darkness,
PSA.107.14	and tore off their shackles.
PSA.107.15	 Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.15	and for the amazing things he has done for people!
PSA.107.16	 For he shattered the bronze gates,
PSA.107.16	and hacked through the iron bars.
PSA.107.17	 They acted like fools in their rebellious ways,
PSA.107.17	and suffered because of their sins.
PSA.107.18	 They lost their appetite for all food,
PSA.107.18	and they drew near the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	 They cried out to the 
PSA.107.19	he delivered them from their troubles.
PSA.107.20	 He sent them an assuring word
PSA.107.20	he rescued them from the pits where they were trapped.
PSA.107.21	 Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.21	and for the amazing things he has done for people!
PSA.107.22	 Let them present thank offerings,
PSA.107.22	and loudly proclaim what he has done!
PSA.107.23	 Some traveled on
PSA.107.23	and carried cargo over the vast waters.
PSA.107.24	 They witnessed the acts of the 
PSA.107.24	his amazing feats on the deep water.
PSA.107.25	 He gave the order for a windstorm,
PSA.107.25	and it stirred up the waves of the sea.
PSA.107.26	 They
PSA.107.26	then dropped into the depths.
PSA.107.26	The sailors’ strength
PSA.107.27	 They swayed
PSA.107.27	and all their skill proved ineffective.
PSA.107.28	 They cried out to the 
PSA.107.28	he delivered them from their troubles.
PSA.107.29	 He calmed the storm,
PSA.107.29	and the waves
PSA.107.30	 The sailors
PSA.107.30	and he led them to the harbor
PSA.107.31	 Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.31	and for the amazing things he has done for people!
PSA.107.32	 Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people!
PSA.107.32	Let them praise him in the place where the leaders preside!
PSA.107.33	 He turned
PSA.107.33	springs of water into arid land,
PSA.107.34	 and a fruitful land into a barren place,
PSA.107.34	because of the sin of its inhabitants.
PSA.107.35	 As for his people,
PSA.107.35	and a dry land into springs of water.
PSA.107.36	 He allowed the hungry to settle there,
PSA.107.36	and they established a city in which to live.
PSA.107.37	 They cultivated
PSA.107.37	and planted vineyards,
PSA.107.37	which yielded a harvest of fruit.
PSA.107.38	 He blessed
PSA.107.38	He would not allow their cattle to decrease in number.
PSA.107.39	 As for their enemies,
PSA.107.39	because of painful distress
PSA.107.40	 He would pour
PSA.107.40	and he made them wander in a wasteland with no road.
PSA.107.41	 Yet he protected
PSA.107.41	and cared for his families like a flock of sheep.
PSA.107.42	 When the godly see this, they rejoice,
PSA.107.42	and every sinner
PSA.107.43	 Whoever is wise, let him take note of these things!
PSA.107.43	Let them consider the 
PSA.108.1	 I am determined,
PSA.108.1	I will sing and praise you with my whole heart.
PSA.108.2	 Awake, O stringed instrument and harp!
PSA.108.2	I will wake up at dawn!
PSA.108.3	 I will give you thanks before the nations, O 
PSA.108.3	I will sing praises to you before foreigners!
PSA.108.4	 For your loyal love extends beyond the sky,
PSA.108.4	and your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
PSA.108.5	 Rise up
PSA.108.5	May your splendor cover the whole earth!
PSA.108.6	 Deliver by your power
PSA.108.6	so that the ones you love may be safe.
PSA.108.7	 God has spoken in his sanctuary:
PSA.108.7	“I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem,
PSA.108.7	the valley of Succoth I will measure off.
PSA.108.8	 Gilead belongs to me,
PSA.108.8	as does Manasseh!
PSA.108.8	Ephraim is my helmet,
PSA.108.8	Judah my royal scepter.
PSA.108.9	 Moab is my wash basin.
PSA.108.9	I will make Edom serve me.
PSA.108.9	I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”
PSA.108.10	 Who will lead me into the fortified city?
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me to Edom?
PSA.108.11	 Have you not rejected us, O God?
PSA.108.11	O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.
PSA.108.12	 Give us help against the enemy,
PSA.108.12	for any help men might offer is futile.
PSA.108.13	 By God’s power we will conquer;
PSA.108.13	he will trample down
PSA.109.1	 O God whom I praise, do not ignore me!
PSA.109.2	 For they say cruel and deceptive things to me;
PSA.109.2	they lie to me.
PSA.109.3	 They surround me and say hateful things;
PSA.109.3	they attack me for no reason.
PSA.109.4	 They repay my love with accusations,
PSA.109.4	but I continue to pray.
PSA.109.5	 They repay me evil for good,
PSA.109.5	and hate for love.
PSA.109.6	 Appoint an evil man to testify against him!
PSA.109.6	May an accuser stand
PSA.109.7	 When he is judged, he will be found
PSA.109.7	Then his prayer will be regarded as sinful.
PSA.109.8	 May his days be few!
PSA.109.8	May another take his job!
PSA.109.9	 May his children
PSA.109.9	and his wife a widow!
PSA.109.10	 May his children
PSA.109.10	asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home!
PSA.109.11	 May the creditor seize
PSA.109.11	May strangers loot his property!
PSA.109.12	 May no one show him kindness!
PSA.109.12	May no one have compassion
PSA.109.13	 May his descendants
PSA.109.13	May the memory of them be wiped out by the time the next generation arrives!
PSA.109.14	 May his ancestors’
PSA.109.14	May his mother’s sin not be forgotten!
PSA.109.15	 May the 
PSA.109.15	and cut off the memory of his children
PSA.109.16	 For he never bothered to show kindness;
PSA.109.16	he harassed the oppressed and needy,
PSA.109.16	and killed the disheartened.
PSA.109.17	 He loved to curse
PSA.109.17	He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has experienced no blessings.
PSA.109.18	 He made cursing a way of life,
PSA.109.18	so curses poured into his stomach like water
PSA.109.18	and seeped into his bones like oil.
PSA.109.19	 May a curse attach itself to him, like a garment one puts on,
PSA.109.19	or a belt
PSA.109.20	 May the 
PSA.109.20	those who say evil things about
PSA.109.21	 O sovereign 
PSA.109.21	intervene on my behalf for the sake of your reputation!
PSA.109.21	Because your loyal love is good, deliver me!
PSA.109.22	 For I am oppressed and needy,
PSA.109.22	and my heart beats violently within me.
PSA.109.23	 I am fading away like a shadow at the end of the day;
PSA.109.23	I am shaken off like a locust.
PSA.109.24	 I am so starved my knees shake;
PSA.109.24	I have turned into skin and bones.
PSA.109.25	 I am disdained by them.
PSA.109.25	When they see me, they shake their heads.
PSA.109.26	 Help me, O 
PSA.109.26	Because you are faithful to me, deliver me!
PSA.109.27	 Then they will realize
PSA.109.27	and that you, 
PSA.109.28	 They curse, but you will bless.
PSA.109.28	When they attack, they will be humiliated,
PSA.109.28	but your servant will rejoice.
PSA.109.29	 My accusers will be covered
PSA.109.29	and draped in humiliation as if it were a robe.
PSA.109.30	 I will thank the 
PSA.109.30	in the middle of a crowd
PSA.109.31	 because he stands at the right hand of the needy,
PSA.109.31	to deliver him from those who threaten
PSA.110.1	 Here is the 
PSA.110.1	“Sit down at my right hand

PSA.114.3	 The sea looked and fled;
PSA.114.3	the Jordan River
PSA.114.4	 The mountains skipped like rams,
PSA.114.4	the hills like lambs.
PSA.114.5	 Why do you flee, O sea?

PSA.116.11	“All men are liars.”
PSA.116.12	 How can I repay the 
PSA.116.12	for all his acts of kindness to me?
PSA.116.13	 I will celebrate my deliverance,

PSA.124.5	 The raging water
PSA.124.5	would have overwhelmed us.
PSA.124.6	 The 
PSA.124.6	for
PSA.124.7	 We escaped with our lives,
PSA.124.7	The snare broke, and we escaped.
PSA.124.8	 Our deliverer is the 
PSA.124.8	the Creator

PSA.125.1	it cannot be upended and will endure forever.
PSA.125.2	 As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
PSA.125.2	so the 
PSA.125.2	now and forevermore.
PSA.125.3	 Indeed,
PSA.125.3	upon the allotted land of the godly.
PSA.125.3	Otherwise the godly might
PSA.125.3	do what is wrong.
PSA.125.4	 Do good, O 
PSA.125.4	to the morally upright!
PSA.125.5	 As for those who are bent on traveling a sinful path,
PSA.125.5	may the 
PSA.125.5	May Israel experience peace!
PSA.126.1	 When the 
PSA.126.1	we thought we were dreaming.
PSA.126.2	 At that time we laughed loudly
PSA.126.2	and shouted for joy.
PSA.126.2	At that time the nations said,
PSA.126.2	“The 
PSA.126.3	 The 
PSA.126.3	We were happy.
PSA.126.4	 O 
PSA.126.4	just as the streams in the arid south are replenished.
PSA.126.5	 Those who shed tears as they plant
PSA.126.5	will shout for joy when they reap the harvest.
PSA.126.6	 The one who weeps as he walks along, carrying his bag
PSA.126.6	will certainly come in with a shout of joy, carrying his sheaves of grain.
PSA.127.1	 If the 
PSA.127.1	then those who build it work in vain.
PSA.127.1	If the 
PSA.127.1	then the watchman stands guard in vain.
PSA.127.2	 It is vain for you to rise early, come home late,
PSA.127.2	and work so hard for your food.
PSA.127.2	Yes,
PSA.127.3	 Yes,
PSA.127.3	the fruit of the womb is a reward.
PSA.127.4	 Sons born during one’s youth
PSA.127.4	are like arrows in a warrior’s hand.
PSA.127.5	 How blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them!
PSA.127.5	They will not be put to shame
PSA.128.1	 How blessed is every one of the 
PSA.128.1	each one who keeps his commands!
PSA.128.2	 You
PSA.128.2	You will be blessed and secure.
PSA.128.3	 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine
PSA.128.3	in the inner rooms of your house;
PSA.128.3	your children

PSA.129.3	 The plowers plowed my back;
PSA.129.3	they made their furrows long.
PSA.129.4	 The 
PSA.129.4	he cut the ropes of the wicked.”
PSA.129.5	 May all who hate Zion
PSA.129.5	be humiliated and turned back!
PSA.129.6	 May they be like the grass on the rooftops
PSA.129.6	which withers before one can even pull it up,
PSA.129.7	 which cannot fill the reaper’s hand,
PSA.129.7	or the lap of the one who gathers the grain!

PSA.130.6	 I yearn for the Lord,
PSA.130.6	more than watchmen do for the morning,
PSA.130.6	yes, more than watchmen do for the morning.

PSA.130.8	 He will deliver
PSA.130.8	from all the consequences of their sins.
PSA.131.1	 O 
PSA.131.1	nor do I have a haughty look.
PSA.131.1	I do not have great aspirations,
PSA.131.1	or concern myself with things that are beyond me.
PSA.131.2	 Indeed
PSA.131.2	like a young child carried by its mother;
PSA.131.2	I am content like the young child I carry.
PSA.131.3	 O Israel, hope in the 
PSA.131.3	now and forevermore!
PSA.132.1	 O 
PSA.132.1	all his strenuous effort,
PSA.132.2	 and how he made a vow to the

PSA.132.3	 He said,
PSA.132.3	or get into my bed.
PSA.132.4	 I will not allow my eyes to sleep,
PSA.132.4	or my eyelids to slumber,
PSA.132.5	 until I find a place for the 
PSA.132.5	a fine dwelling place
PSA.132.6	 Look, we heard about it
PSA.132.6	we found it in the territory of Jaar.
PSA.132.7	 Let us go to his dwelling place!
PSA.132.7	Let us worship
PSA.132.8	 Ascend, O 
PSA.132.8	you and the ark of your strength!
PSA.132.9	 May your priests be clothed with integrity!
PSA.132.9	May your loyal followers shout for joy!
PSA.132.10	 For the sake of David, your servant,
PSA.132.10	do not reject your chosen king!
PSA.132.11	 The 
PSA.132.11	he will not go back on his word.
PSA.132.11	He said,
PSA.132.12	 If your sons keep my covenant
PSA.132.12	and the rules I teach them,
PSA.132.12	their sons will also sit on your throne forever.”
PSA.132.13	 Certainly
PSA.132.13	he decided to make it his home.
PSA.132.14	 He said,
PSA.132.14	I will live here, for I have chosen it.
PSA.132.15	 I will abundantly supply what she needs;
PSA.132.15	I will give her poor all the food they need.
PSA.132.16	 I will protect her priests,
PSA.132.16	and her godly people will shout exuberantly.
PSA.132.17	 There I will make David strong;
PSA.132.17	I have determined that my chosen king’s dynasty will continue.
PSA.132.18	 I will humiliate his enemies,
PSA.132.18	and his crown will shine.
PSA.133.1	 Look! How good and how pleasant it is
PSA.133.1	when brothers live together!
PSA.133.2	 It is like fine oil poured on the head
PSA.133.2	which flows down the beard
PSA.133.2	Aaron’s beard,
PSA.133.2	and then flows down his garments.
PSA.133.3	 It is like the dew of Hermon,
PSA.133.3	which flows down upon the hills of Zion.
PSA.133.3	Indeed
PSA.133.3	a blessing will be available – eternal life.
PSA.134.1	 Attention!
PSA.134.1	all you servants of the 
PSA.134.1	who serve
PSA.134.2	 Lift your hands toward the sanctuary
PSA.134.2	and praise the

PSA.135.6	 He does whatever he pleases
PSA.135.6	in heaven and on earth,
PSA.135.6	in the seas and all the ocean depths.
PSA.135.7	 He causes the clouds to arise from the end of the earth,
PSA.135.7	makes lightning bolts accompany the rain,
PSA.135.7	and brings the wind out of his storehouses.
PSA.135.8	 He struck down the firstborn of Egypt,
PSA.135.8	including both men and animals.
PSA.135.9	 He performed awesome deeds
PSA.135.9	in your midst, O Egypt,
PSA.135.9	against Pharaoh and all his servants.
PSA.135.10	 He defeated many nations,
PSA.135.10	and killed mighty kings – 
PSA.135.11	 Sihon, king of the Amorites,
PSA.135.11	and Og, king of Bashan,
PSA.135.11	and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
PSA.135.12	 He gave their land as an inheritance,

PSA.137.1	 By the rivers of Babylon
PSA.137.1	we sit down and weep
PSA.137.1	when we remember Zion.
PSA.137.2	 On the poplars in her midst
PSA.137.2	we hang our harps,
PSA.137.3	 for there our captors ask us to compose songs;
PSA.137.3	those who mock us demand that we be happy, saying:
PSA.137.3	“Sing for us a song about Zion!”
PSA.137.4	 How can we sing a song to the 
PSA.137.4	in a foreign land?
PSA.137.5	 If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
PSA.137.5	may my right hand be crippled!
PSA.137.6	 May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
PSA.137.6	if I do not remember you,
PSA.137.6	and do not give Jerusalem priority
PSA.137.6	over whatever gives me the most joy.
PSA.137.7	 Remember, O 
PSA.137.7	on the day Jerusalem fell.
PSA.137.7	They said, “Tear it down, tear it down,
PSA.137.7	right to its very foundation!”
PSA.137.8	 O daughter Babylon, soon to be devastated!
PSA.137.8	How blessed will be the one who repays you
PSA.137.8	for what you dished out to us!
PSA.137.9	 How blessed will be the one who grabs your babies
PSA.137.9	and smashes them on a rock!
PSA.138.1	 I will give you thanks with all my heart;
PSA.138.1	before the heavenly assembly
PSA.138.2	 I will bow down toward your holy temple,
PSA.138.2	and give thanks to your name,
PSA.138.2	because of your loyal love and faithfulness,
PSA.138.2	for you have exalted your promise above the entire sky.
PSA.138.3	 When
PSA.138.3	You made me bold and energized me.
PSA.138.4	 Let all the kings of the earth give thanks
PSA.138.4	when they hear the words you speak.
PSA.138.5	 Let them sing about the

PSA.138.7	 Even when I must walk in the midst of danger,
PSA.138.7	You oppose my angry enemies,
PSA.138.7	and your right hand delivers me.
PSA.138.8	 The 
PSA.138.8	O 
PSA.138.8	Do not abandon those whom you have made!
PSA.139.1	 O 
PSA.139.2	 You know when I sit down and when I get up;
PSA.139.2	even from far away you understand my motives.
PSA.139.3	 You carefully observe me when I travel or when I lie down to rest;
PSA.139.3	you are aware of everything I do.
PSA.139.4	 Certainly
PSA.139.4	without you, O 
PSA.139.5	 You squeeze me in from behind and in front;
PSA.139.5	you place your hand on me.
PSA.139.6	 Your knowledge is beyond my comprehension;
PSA.139.6	it is so far beyond me, I am unable to fathom it.
PSA.139.7	 Where can I go to escape your spirit?
PSA.139.7	Where can I flee to escape your presence?
PSA.139.8	 If I were to ascend
PSA.139.8	If I were to sprawl out in Sheol, there you would be.
PSA.139.9	 If I were to fly away
PSA.139.9	and settle down on the other side
PSA.139.10	 even there your hand would guide me,
PSA.139.10	your right hand would grab hold of me.
PSA.139.11	 If I were to say, “Certainly the darkness will cover me,
PSA.139.11	and the light will turn to night all around me,”
PSA.139.12	 even the darkness is not too dark for you to see,
PSA.139.12	and the night is as bright as
PSA.139.12	darkness and light are the same to you.
PSA.139.13	 Certainly
PSA.139.13	you wove me together
PSA.139.14	 I will give you thanks because your deeds are awesome and amazing.
PSA.139.14	You knew me thoroughly;
PSA.139.15	 my bones were not hidden from you,
PSA.139.15	when
PSA.139.15	and sewed together in the depths of the earth.
PSA.139.16	 Your eyes saw me when I was inside the womb.
PSA.139.16	All the days ordained for me
PSA.139.16	were recorded in your scroll
PSA.139.16	before one of them came into existence.
PSA.139.17	 How difficult it is for me to fathom your thoughts about me, O God!
PSA.139.17	How vast is their sum total!
PSA.139.18	 If I tried to count them,
PSA.139.18	they would outnumber the grains of sand.
PSA.139.18	Even if I finished counting them,
PSA.139.18	I would still have to contend with you.
PSA.139.19	 If only
PSA.139.19	Get away from me, you violent men!
PSA.139.20	 They
PSA.139.20	your enemies lie.
PSA.139.21	 O 
PSA.139.21	and despise those who oppose you?
PSA.139.22	 I absolutely hate them,
PSA.139.22	they have become my enemies!
PSA.139.23	 Examine me, and probe my thoughts!
PSA.139.23	Test me, and know my concerns!
PSA.139.24	 See if there is any idolatrous tendency
PSA.139.24	and lead me in the reliable ancient path!
PSA.140.1	 O 
PSA.140.1	Protect me from violent men,
PSA.140.2	 who plan ways to harm me.
PSA.140.2	All day long they stir up conflict.
PSA.140.3	 Their tongues wound like a serpent;
PSA.140.3	a viper’s
PSA.140.4	 O 
PSA.140.4	Protect me from violent men,
PSA.140.4	who plan to knock me over.
PSA.140.5	 Proud men hide a snare for me;
PSA.140.5	evil men
PSA.140.5	they set traps for me. (Selah)
PSA.140.6	 I say to the 
PSA.140.6	O 
PSA.140.7	 O sovereign 
PSA.140.7	you shield
PSA.140.8	 O 
PSA.140.8	Do not allow their
PSA.140.9	 As for the heads of those who surround me – 
PSA.140.9	may the harm done by
PSA.140.10	 May he rain down
PSA.140.10	May he throw them into the fire!
PSA.140.10	From bottomless pits they will not escape.
PSA.140.11	 A slanderer
PSA.140.11	calamity will hunt down a violent man and strike him down.
PSA.140.12	 I know
PSA.140.12	and vindicates the poor.
PSA.140.13	 Certainly the godly will give thanks to your name;
PSA.140.13	the morally upright will live in your presence.
PSA.141.1	 O 
PSA.141.1	Pay attention to me when I cry out to you!
PSA.141.2	 May you accept my prayer like incense,
PSA.141.2	my uplifted hands like the evening offering!
PSA.141.3	 O 
PSA.141.3	Protect the opening
PSA.141.4	 Do not let me have evil desires,
PSA.141.4	or participate in sinful activities
PSA.141.4	with men who behave wickedly.
PSA.141.4	I will not eat their delicacies.
PSA.141.5	 May the godly strike me in love and correct me!
PSA.141.5	May my head not refuse
PSA.141.5	Indeed, my prayer is a witness against their evil deeds.
PSA.141.6	 They will be thrown down the side of a cliff by their judges.
PSA.141.6	They
PSA.141.7	 As when one plows and breaks up the soil,
PSA.141.7	so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
PSA.141.8	 Surely I am looking to you,
PSA.141.8	In you I take shelter.
PSA.141.8	Do not expose me to danger!
PSA.141.9	 Protect me from the snare they have laid for me,
PSA.141.9	and the traps the evildoers have set.
PSA.141.10	 Let the wicked fall
PSA.141.10	while I escape.
PSA.142.1	 To the 
PSA.142.1	to the 
PSA.142.2	 I pour out my lament before him;
PSA.142.2	I tell him about
PSA.142.3	 Even when my strength leaves me,
PSA.142.3	you watch my footsteps.
PSA.142.3	In the path where I walk
PSA.142.3	they have hidden a trap for me.
PSA.142.4	 Look to the right and see!
PSA.142.4	No one cares about me.
PSA.142.4	I have nowhere to run;
PSA.142.4	no one is concerned about my life.
PSA.142.5	 I cry out to you, O 
PSA.142.5	I say, “You are my shelter,
PSA.142.5	my security
PSA.142.6	 Listen to my cry for help,
PSA.142.6	for I am in serious trouble!
PSA.142.6	Rescue me from those who chase me,
PSA.142.6	for they are stronger than I am.
PSA.142.7	 Free me
PSA.142.7	that I may give thanks to your name.
PSA.142.7	Because of me the godly will assemble,
PSA.142.7	for you will vindicate me.
PSA.143.1	 O 
PSA.143.1	Pay attention to my plea for help!
PSA.143.1	Because of your faithfulness and justice, answer me!
PSA.143.2	 Do not sit in judgment on
PSA.143.2	for no one alive is innocent before you.
PSA.143.3	 Certainly
PSA.143.3	They smash me into the ground.
PSA.143.3	They force me to live
PSA.143.3	like those who have been dead for ages.
PSA.143.4	 My strength leaves me;
PSA.143.4	I am absolutely shocked.
PSA.143.5	 I recall the old days;
PSA.143.5	I meditate on all you have done;
PSA.143.5	I reflect on your accomplishments.
PSA.143.6	 I spread my hands out to you in prayer;
PSA.143.6	my soul thirsts for you in a parched
PSA.143.7	 Answer me quickly, 
PSA.143.7	My strength is fading.
PSA.143.7	Do not reject me,
PSA.143.7	or I will join
PSA.143.8	 May I hear about your loyal love in the morning,
PSA.143.8	for I trust in you.
PSA.143.8	Show me the way I should go,
PSA.143.8	because I long for you.
PSA.143.9	 Rescue me from my enemies, O 
PSA.143.9	I run to you for protection.
PSA.143.10	 Teach me to do what pleases you,
PSA.143.10	for you are my God.
PSA.143.10	May your kind presence
PSA.143.10	lead me
PSA.143.11	 O 
PSA.143.11	Because of your justice, rescue me from trouble!
PSA.143.12	 As a demonstration of your loyal love,
PSA.143.12	Annihilate
PSA.143.12	for I am your servant.
PSA.144.1	 The 
PSA.144.1	the one who trains my hands for battle,
PSA.144.1	and my fingers for war,
PSA.144.2	 who loves me
PSA.144.2	my refuge
PSA.144.2	my shield and the one in whom I take shelter,

PRO.4.14	or walk
PRO.4.15	 Avoid it, do not go on it;
PRO.4.15	turn away from it, and go on.
PRO.4.16	 For they cannot sleep unless they cause harm;
PRO.4.16	they are robbed of sleep
PRO.4.17	 For they eat bread
PRO.4.17	and drink wine obtained from violence.
PRO.4.18	 But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light,
PRO.4.18	growing brighter and brighter
PRO.4.19	 The way of the wicked is like gloomy darkness;

PRO.5.4	 but in the end
PRO.5.4	sharp as a two-edged
PRO.5.5	 Her feet go down to death;
PRO.5.5	her steps lead straight to the grave.
PRO.5.6	 Lest
PRO.5.6	her paths are unstable
PRO.5.7	 So now, children,
PRO.5.7	do not turn aside from the words I speak.
PRO.5.8	 Keep yourself
PRO.5.8	and do not go near the door of her house,
PRO.5.9	 lest you give your vigor
PRO.5.9	and your years to a cruel person,
PRO.5.10	 lest strangers devour
PRO.5.10	and your labor
PRO.5.11	 And at the end of your life
PRO.5.11	when your flesh and your body are wasted away.
PRO.5.12	 And you will say, “How I hated discipline!
PRO.5.12	My heart spurned reproof!
PRO.5.13	 For
PRO.5.13	and I did not heed
PRO.5.14	 I almost
PRO.5.14	in the midst of the whole congregation!”
PRO.5.15	 Drink water from your own cistern
PRO.5.15	and running water from your own well.
PRO.5.16	 Should your springs be dispersed
PRO.5.16	your streams of water in the wide plazas?
PRO.5.17	 Let them be for yourself
PRO.5.17	and not for strangers with you.
PRO.5.18	 May your fountain be blessed,
PRO.5.18	and may you rejoice
PRO.5.19	 a loving doe,
PRO.5.19	may her breasts satisfy you at all times,
PRO.5.19	may you be captivated
PRO.5.20	 But why should you be captivated,
PRO.5.20	and embrace the bosom of a different woman?
PRO.5.21	 For the ways of a person
PRO.5.21	and the 
PRO.5.22	 The wicked
PRO.5.22	and he will be held
PRO.5.23	 He will die because
PRO.5.23	because of the greatness of his folly
PRO.6.1	 My child,
PRO.6.1	and
PRO.6.2	 if
PRO.6.2	and have been caught by the words you have spoken,
PRO.6.3	 then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself,
PRO.6.3	because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power:
PRO.6.3	go, humble yourself,
PRO.6.3	and appeal firmly
PRO.6.4	 Permit no sleep to your eyes
PRO.6.4	or slumber to your eyelids.
PRO.6.5	 Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare,
PRO.6.5	and like a bird from the trap
PRO.6.6	 Go to the ant, you sluggard;
PRO.6.6	observe its ways and be wise!
PRO.6.7	 It has no commander, 
PRO.6.7	overseer, or
PRO.6.8	 yet it prepares its food in the summer;
PRO.6.8	it gathers at the harvest what it will eat.
PRO.6.9	 How long, you sluggard, will you lie there?
PRO.6.9	When will you rise from your sleep?
PRO.6.10	 A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.6.10	a little folding of the hands to relax,
PRO.6.11	 and your poverty will come like a robber,
PRO.6.11	and your need like an armed man.
PRO.6.12	 A worthless and wicked person
PRO.6.12	walks around saying perverse
PRO.6.13	 he winks with his eyes,
PRO.6.13	signals with his feet,
PRO.6.13	and points with his fingers;
PRO.6.14	 he plots evil with perverse thoughts
PRO.6.14	he spreads contention
PRO.6.15	 Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;
PRO.6.15	in an instant
PRO.6.16	 There are six things that the 
PRO.6.16	even
PRO.6.17	 haughty eyes,
PRO.6.17	and hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	 a heart that devises wicked plans,
PRO.6.18	feet that are swift to run
PRO.6.19	 a false witness who pours out lies,
PRO.6.19	and a person who spreads discord
PRO.6.20	 My child, guard the commands of your father
PRO.6.20	and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.
PRO.6.21	 Bind them
PRO.6.21	fasten them around your neck.
PRO.6.22	 When you walk about,
PRO.6.22	when you lie down, they will watch over you;
PRO.6.22	when you wake up,
PRO.6.23	 For the commandments
PRO.6.23	instruction is like a light,
PRO.6.23	and rebukes of discipline are like
PRO.6.24	 by keeping
PRO.6.24	from the smooth tongue of
PRO.6.25	 Do not lust
PRO.6.25	and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;
PRO.6.26	 for on account
PRO.6.26	but the wife of another man
PRO.6.27	 Can a man hold
PRO.6.27	without
PRO.6.28	 Can
PRO.6.28	without scorching his feet? 
PRO.6.29	 So it is with
PRO.6.29	no one
PRO.6.30	 People
PRO.6.30	to fulfill his need
PRO.6.31	 Yet
PRO.6.31	he might even have to give
PRO.6.32	 A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks wisdom,
PRO.6.32	whoever does it destroys his own life.
PRO.6.33	 He will be beaten and despised,
PRO.6.33	and his reproach will not be wiped away;
PRO.6.34	 for jealousy kindles
PRO.6.34	and he will not show mercy
PRO.6.35	 He will not consider
PRO.6.35	he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.
PRO.7.1	 My child,
PRO.7.1	and treasure up my commands in your own keeping.
PRO.7.2	 Keep my commands
PRO.7.2	and obey
PRO.7.3	 Bind them on your forearm;
PRO.7.3	write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.7.4	 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
PRO.7.4	and call understanding a close relative,
PRO.7.5	 so that they may keep you
PRO.7.5	from the loose woman
PRO.7.6	 For at the window of my house
PRO.7.6	through my window lattice I looked out 
PRO.7.7	 and I saw among the naive – 
PRO.7.7	I discerned among the youths
PRO.7.7	a young man
PRO.7.8	 He was passing by the street near her corner,
PRO.7.8	making his way
PRO.7.9	 in the twilight, the evening,
PRO.7.9	in the dark of the night.
PRO.7.10	 Suddenly
PRO.7.10	She was dressed like a prostitute
PRO.7.11	 (She is loud and rebellious,
PRO.7.11	she
PRO.7.12	 at one time outside, at another
PRO.7.12	and by every corner she lies in wait.)
PRO.7.13	 So she grabbed him and kissed him,
PRO.7.13	and with a bold expression
PRO.7.14	 “I have
PRO.7.14	today I have fulfilled my vows!
PRO.7.15	 That is why I came out to meet you,
PRO.7.15	to look for you,
PRO.7.16	 I have spread my bed with elegant coverings,
PRO.7.16	with richly colored fabric
PRO.7.17	 I have perfumed my bed 
PRO.7.17	with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	 Come, let’s drink deeply
PRO.7.18	let’s delight ourselves
PRO.7.19	 For my husband
PRO.7.19	he has gone on a journey of some distance.
PRO.7.20	 He has taken a bag of money with him;
PRO.7.20	he will not return until
PRO.7.21	 She persuaded him
PRO.7.21	with her smooth talk
PRO.7.22	 Suddenly he went
PRO.7.22	like an ox that goes to the slaughter,
PRO.7.22	like a stag prancing into a trapper’s snare
PRO.7.23	 till an arrow pierces his liver
PRO.7.23	like a bird hurrying into a trap,
PRO.7.23	and he does not know that it will cost him his life.
PRO.7.24	 So now, sons,
PRO.7.24	and pay attention to the words I speak.
PRO.7.25	 Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways – 
PRO.7.25	do not wander into her pathways;
PRO.7.26	 for she has brought down
PRO.7.26	and all those she has slain are many.
PRO.7.27	 Her house is the way to the grave,
PRO.7.27	going down
PRO.8.1	 Does not wisdom call out?
PRO.8.1	Does not understanding raise her voice?
PRO.8.2	 At the top
PRO.8.2	at the intersection
PRO.8.3	 beside the gates opening into
PRO.8.3	at the entrance of the doorways she cries out:
PRO.8.4	 “To you, O people,
PRO.8.4	and my voice calls
PRO.8.5	 You who are naive, discern
PRO.8.5	And you fools, understand discernment!
PRO.8.6	 Listen, for I will speak excellent things,
PRO.8.6	and my lips will utter
PRO.8.7	 For my mouth
PRO.8.7	and my lips
PRO.8.8	 All the words of my mouth are righteous;
PRO.8.8	there is nothing in them twisted
PRO.8.9	 All of them are clear
PRO.8.9	and upright to those who find knowledge.
PRO.8.10	 Receive my instruction
PRO.8.10	and knowledge rather than choice gold.
PRO.8.11	 For wisdom is better than rubies,
PRO.8.11	and desirable things cannot be compared
PRO.8.12	 “I, wisdom, live with prudence,
PRO.8.12	and I find
PRO.8.13	 The fear of the 
PRO.8.13	I hate arrogant pride
PRO.8.13	and perverse utterances.
PRO.8.14	 Counsel and sound wisdom belong to me;
PRO.8.14	I possess understanding and might.
PRO.8.15	 Kings reign by means of me,
PRO.8.15	and potentates
PRO.8.16	 by me princes rule,
PRO.8.16	as well as nobles and
PRO.8.17	 I love
PRO.8.17	and those who seek me find me.
PRO.8.18	 Riches and honor are with me,
PRO.8.18	long-lasting wealth and righteousness.
PRO.8.19	 My fruit is better than the purest gold,
PRO.8.19	and what I produce
PRO.8.20	 I walk in the path of righteousness,
PRO.8.20	in the pathway of justice,
PRO.8.21	 that I may cause
PRO.8.21	and that I may fill
PRO.8.22	 The 
PRO.8.22	before his deeds of long ago.
PRO.8.23	 From eternity I was appointed,
PRO.8.23	from the beginning, from before the world existed.
PRO.8.24	 When there were no deep oceans
PRO.8.24	when there were no springs overflowing
PRO.8.25	 before the mountains were set in place – 
PRO.8.25	before the hills – I was born,
PRO.8.26	 before he made the earth and its fields,
PRO.8.26	or the beginning
PRO.8.27	 When he established the heavens, I was there;
PRO.8.27	when he marked out the horizon
PRO.8.28	 when he established the clouds above,
PRO.8.28	when the fountains of the deep grew strong,
PRO.8.29	 when he gave the sea his decree
PRO.8.29	that the waters should not pass over his command,
PRO.8.29	when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
PRO.8.30	 then I was
PRO.8.30	and I was his delight
PRO.8.30	rejoicing before him at all times,
PRO.8.31	 rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth,
PRO.8.31	and delighting
PRO.8.32	 “So now, children,
PRO.8.32	blessed are those who keep my ways.
PRO.8.33	 Listen to my instruction
PRO.8.33	and do not neglect it.

PRO.24.11	and hold back those slipping to the slaughter.
PRO.24.12	 If you say, “But we did not know about this,”
PRO.24.12	does not the one who evaluates
PRO.24.12	Does not the one who guards your life know?
PRO.24.12	Will he not repay each person according to his deeds?
PRO.24.13	 Eat honey,
PRO.24.13	and honey from the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.
PRO.24.14	 Likewise, know
PRO.24.14	if you find it,
PRO.24.14	and your hope will not be cut off.
PRO.24.15	 Do not lie in wait like the wicked
PRO.24.15	do not assault
PRO.24.16	 Although
PRO.24.16	but the wicked will be brought down
PRO.24.17	 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,

PRO.24.19	 Do not fret because of evil people
PRO.24.19	or be envious of wicked people,
PRO.24.20	 for the evil person has no future,
PRO.24.20	and the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.
PRO.24.21	 Fear the 
PRO.24.21	and do not associate
PRO.24.22	 for suddenly their destruction will overtake them,
PRO.24.22	and who knows the ruinous judgment both the 
PRO.24.23	 These sayings also are from the wise:
PRO.24.23	To show partiality
PRO.24.24	 The one who says to the guilty,
PRO.24.24	peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce
PRO.24.25	 But there will be delight
PRO.24.25	and a pleasing blessing
PRO.24.26	 Like a kiss on the lips
PRO.24.26	is the one who gives an honest answer. 
PRO.24.27	 Establish your work outside and get your fields ready;
PRO.24.27	afterward build
PRO.24.28	 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,
PRO.24.28	and do not deceive with your words.
PRO.24.29	 Do not say, “I will do to him just as he has done to me;
PRO.24.29	I will pay him back
PRO.24.30	 I passed by the field of a sluggard,
PRO.24.30	by the vineyard of one who lacks wisdom.
PRO.24.31	 I saw
PRO.24.31	the ground
PRO.24.31	and its stone wall was broken down.
PRO.24.32	 When I saw this, I gave careful consideration to it;
PRO.24.32	I received instruction from what I saw:
PRO.24.33	 “A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.24.33	a little folding of the hands to relax,
PRO.24.34	 and your poverty will come like a bandit,
PRO.24.34	and your need like an armed robber.”
PRO.25.1	 These also are proverbs of Solomon,
PRO.25.1	which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied:
PRO.25.2	 It is the glory of God
PRO.25.2	and it is the glory of a king to search out a matter.
PRO.25.3	 As the heaven is high
PRO.25.3	so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
PRO.25.4	 Remove the dross from the silver,
PRO.25.4	and material
PRO.25.5	 remove the wicked from before the king,
PRO.25.5	and his throne
PRO.25.6	 Do not honor yourself before the king,
PRO.25.6	and do not stand in the place of great men;
PRO.25.7	 for it is better for him
PRO.25.7	than to put you lower
PRO.25.7	whom your eyes have seen.
PRO.25.8	 Do not go out hastily to litigation,
PRO.25.8	or
PRO.25.8	when your neighbor puts you to shame?
PRO.25.9	 When you argue a case
PRO.25.9	do not reveal the secret of another person,
PRO.25.10	 lest the one who hears it put you to shame
PRO.25.10	and your infamy
PRO.25.11	 Like apples of gold in settings of silver,
PRO.25.11	so is a word skillfully spoken.
PRO.25.12	 Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold,
PRO.25.12	so is a wise reprover to the ear of the one who listens.
PRO.25.13	 Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
PRO.25.13	so is a faithful messenger to those who send him,
PRO.25.13	for he refreshes the heart
PRO.25.14	 Like cloudy skies and wind that produce no rain,
PRO.25.14	so is the one who boasts
PRO.25.15	 Through patience
PRO.25.15	and a soft tongue
PRO.25.16	 When you find
PRO.25.16	lest you become stuffed
PRO.25.17	 Don’t set foot too frequently
PRO.25.17	lest he become weary
PRO.25.18	 Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow,
PRO.25.18	so is the one who testifies against
PRO.25.19	 Like a bad tooth or a foot out of joint,
PRO.25.19	so is confidence
PRO.25.20	 Like one who takes off a garment on a cold day,
PRO.25.20	or like vinegar poured on soda,
PRO.25.20	so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
PRO.25.21	 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,
PRO.25.21	and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,
PRO.25.22	 for you will heap coals of fire on his head,
PRO.25.22	and the 
PRO.25.23	 The north wind
PRO.25.23	and a gossiping tongue
PRO.25.24	 It is better to live on a corner of the housetop
PRO.25.24	than in a house in company with a quarrelsome wife.
PRO.25.25	 Like cold water to a weary person,
PRO.25.25	so is good news from a distant land.
PRO.25.26	 Like a muddied
PRO.25.26	so is a righteous person who gives way
PRO.25.27	 It is not good
PRO.25.27	nor is it honorable for people to seek their own glory.
PRO.25.28	 Like a city that is broken down and without a wall,
PRO.25.28	so is a person who cannot control his temper.
PRO.26.1	 Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,
PRO.26.1	so honor
PRO.26.2	 Like a fluttering bird or like a flying swallow,
PRO.26.2	so a curse without cause
PRO.26.3	 A whip for the horse and a bridle for the donkey,
PRO.26.3	and a rod for the backs of fools!
PRO.26.4	 Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.4	lest you yourself also be like him.
PRO.26.5	 Answer a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.5	lest he be wise in his own estimation.
PRO.26.6	 Like cutting off the feet or drinking violence,
PRO.26.6	so is sending
PRO.26.7	 Like legs that hang limp
PRO.26.7	so
PRO.26.8	 Like tying a stone in a sling,
PRO.26.8	so is giving honor to a fool.
PRO.26.9	 Like a thorn
PRO.26.9	so is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
PRO.26.10	 Like an archer who wounds at random,
PRO.26.10	so is the one who hires
PRO.26.11	 Like a dog that returns to its vomit,
PRO.26.11	so a fool repeats his folly.
PRO.26.12	 Do you see
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a fool
PRO.26.13	 The sluggard
PRO.26.13	A lion in the streets!”
PRO.26.14	 Like
PRO.26.14	so a sluggard turns
PRO.26.15	 The sluggard plunges
PRO.26.15	he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
PRO.26.16	 The sluggard is wiser in his own estimation
PRO.26.16	than seven people who respond with good sense.
PRO.26.17	 Like one who grabs a wild dog by the ears,
PRO.26.17	so is the person passing by who becomes furious
PRO.26.18	 Like a madman
PRO.26.18	firebrands and deadly arrows,
PRO.26.19	 so is a person
PRO.26.19	and says, “Was I not only joking?”
PRO.26.20	 Where there is no wood, a fire goes out,
PRO.26.20	and where there is no gossip,
PRO.26.21	 Like charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire,
PRO.26.21	so is a contentious person
PRO.26.22	 The words of a gossip are like delicious morsels;
PRO.26.22	they go down into a person’s innermost being.

PRO.26.24	 The one who hates others disguises
PRO.26.24	but he stores up
PRO.26.25	 When
PRO.26.25	for there are seven
PRO.26.26	 Though his
PRO.26.26	his evil will be uncovered
PRO.26.27	 The one who digs a pit
PRO.26.27	the one who rolls a stone – it will come back on him.
PRO.26.28	 A lying tongue
PRO.26.28	and a flattering mouth works ruin.
PRO.27.1	 Do not boast
PRO.27.1	for you do not know
PRO.27.2	 Let another
PRO.27.2	someone else,
PRO.27.3	 A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,
PRO.27.3	but vexation
PRO.27.4	 Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming,
PRO.27.4	but who can stand before jealousy?
PRO.27.5	 Better is open
PRO.27.5	than hidden
PRO.27.6	 Faithful
PRO.27.6	but the kisses
PRO.27.7	 The one whose appetite
PRO.27.7	but to the hungry mouth
PRO.27.8	 Like a bird that wanders
PRO.27.8	so is a person who wanders from his home.
PRO.27.9	 Ointment and incense make the heart rejoice,
PRO.27.9	likewise the sweetness of one’s friend from sincere counsel.
PRO.27.10	 Do not forsake your friend and your father’s friend,
PRO.27.10	and do not enter your brother’s house in the day of your disaster;
PRO.27.10	a neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away.
PRO.27.11	 Be wise, my son,
PRO.27.11	so that I may answer
PRO.27.12	 A shrewd person sees danger and hides himself,
PRO.27.12	but the naive keep right on going
PRO.27.13	 Take a man’s
PRO.27.13	and when he gives surety for a stranger,
PRO.27.14	 If someone blesses
PRO.27.14	it will be counted as a curse to him.
PRO.27.15	 A continual dripping on a rainy day
PRO.27.15	and a contentious wife
PRO.27.16	 Whoever hides her hides the wind
PRO.27.16	or grasps
PRO.27.17	 As
PRO.27.17	so a person
PRO.27.18	 The one who tends a fig tree
PRO.27.18	and whoever takes care of
PRO.27.19	 As in water the face is reflected as a face,
PRO.27.19	so a person’s heart
PRO.27.20	 As
PRO.27.20	so the eyes of a person
PRO.27.21	 As the crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold,
PRO.27.21	so a person
PRO.27.22	 If you should pound
PRO.27.22	among the grain
PRO.27.22	his foolishness would not depart from him.
PRO.27.23	 Pay careful attention to
PRO.27.23	give careful attention
PRO.27.24	 for riches do not last
PRO.27.24	nor does a crown last
PRO.27.25	 When the hay is removed and new grass appears,
PRO.27.25	and the grass from the hills is gathered in,
PRO.27.26	 the lambs will be for your clothing,
PRO.27.26	and the goats will be for the price of a field.
PRO.27.27	 And there will be enough goat’s milk for your food,
PRO.27.27	for the food of your household,
PRO.27.27	and for the sustenance
PRO.28.1	 The wicked person flees when there is no one pursuing,
PRO.28.1	but the righteous person is as confident
PRO.28.2	 When a country is rebellious
PRO.28.2	but by someone who is discerning and knowledgeable
PRO.28.3	 A poor person
PRO.28.3	is like
PRO.28.4	 Those who forsake the law
PRO.28.4	but those who keep the law contend
PRO.28.5	 Evil people
PRO.28.5	but those who seek the 
PRO.28.6	 A poor person
PRO.28.6	than one who is perverse in his ways
PRO.28.7	 The one who keeps the law
PRO.28.7	but a companion of gluttons brings shame
PRO.28.8	 The one who increases his wealth by increasing interest
PRO.28.8	gathers it for someone who is gracious
PRO.28.9	 The one who turns away his ear
PRO.28.9	even his prayer
PRO.28.10	 The one who leads the upright astray in an evil way
PRO.28.10	will himself fall into his own pit,
PRO.28.10	but the blameless will inherit what is good.
PRO.28.11	 A rich person
PRO.28.11	but a discerning poor person can evaluate him properly.
PRO.28.12	 When the righteous rejoice,
PRO.28.12	but when the wicked rise to power, people are sought out.
PRO.28.13	 The one who covers
PRO.28.13	but whoever confesses them and forsakes them will find mercy.
PRO.28.14	 Blessed is the one who is always cautious,
PRO.28.14	but whoever hardens his heart
PRO.28.15	 Like
PRO.28.15	so is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
PRO.28.16	 The prince who is a great oppressor lacks wisdom,
PRO.28.16	but the one who hates
PRO.28.17	 The one who is tormented
PRO.28.17	let no one support him.
PRO.28.18	 The one who walks blamelessly will be delivered,
PRO.28.18	but whoever is perverse in his ways will fall
PRO.28.19	 The one who works his land will be satisfied with food,
PRO.28.19	but whoever chases daydreams
PRO.28.20	 A faithful person
PRO.28.20	but the one who hastens
PRO.28.21	 To show partiality
PRO.28.21	for a person will transgress over the smallest piece of bread.
PRO.28.22	 The stingy person
PRO.28.22	and does not know that poverty will overtake him.
PRO.28.23	 The one who reproves
PRO.28.23	than the one who flatters
PRO.28.24	 The one who robs
PRO.28.24	is a companion
PRO.28.25	 The greedy person
PRO.28.25	but the one who trusts
PRO.28.26	 The one who trusts in his own heart
PRO.28.26	but the one who walks in wisdom
PRO.28.27	 The one who gives to the poor will not lack,
PRO.28.27	but whoever shuts his eyes to them
PRO.28.28	 When the wicked gain control,
PRO.28.28	but when they perish,
PRO.29.1	 The one who stiffens his neck
PRO.29.1	will suddenly be destroyed
PRO.29.2	 When the righteous become numerous,
PRO.29.2	when the wicked rule, the people groan.
PRO.29.3	 The man
PRO.29.3	but whoever associates
PRO.29.4	 A king brings stability
PRO.29.4	but one who exacts tribute
PRO.29.5	 The one
PRO.29.5	spreads a net
PRO.29.6	 In the transgression of an evil person there is a snare,
PRO.29.6	but a righteous person can sing
PRO.29.7	 The righteous person cares for
PRO.29.7	the wicked does not understand such
PRO.29.8	 Scornful people
PRO.29.8	but those who are wise turn away wrath.
PRO.29.9	 If a wise person
PRO.29.9	there is no peace
PRO.29.10	 Bloodthirsty people
PRO.29.10	as for the upright, they seek his life.
PRO.29.11	 A fool lets fly with all his temper,
PRO.29.11	but a wise person keeps it back.
PRO.29.12	 If a ruler listens to
PRO.29.12	all his ministers

PRO.29.13	the 
PRO.29.14	 If a king judges the poor in truth,
PRO.29.14	his throne
PRO.29.15	 A rod and reproof
PRO.29.15	but a child who is unrestrained
PRO.29.16	 When the wicked increase,
PRO.29.16	but the righteous will see
PRO.29.17	 Discipline your child, and he will give you rest;
PRO.29.17	he will bring you
PRO.29.18	 When there is no prophetic vision
PRO.29.18	but the one who keeps the law,
PRO.29.19	 A servant
PRO.29.19	for although
PRO.29.20	 Do you see someone
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.29.21	 If
PRO.29.21	he will be a weakling
PRO.29.22	 An angry person
PRO.29.22	and a wrathful person
PRO.29.23	 A person’s pride
PRO.29.23	but one who has a lowly spirit
PRO.29.24	 Whoever shares with a thief
PRO.29.24	he hears the oath to testify,
PRO.29.25	 The fear of people
PRO.29.25	but whoever trusts in the

PRO.30.1	 The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle:
PRO.30.1	This
PRO.30.2	 Surely
PRO.30.2	and I do not have human understanding;
PRO.30.3	 I have not learned wisdom,
PRO.30.3	nor do I have knowledge
PRO.30.4	 Who has ascended into heaven, and then descended?
PRO.30.4	Who has gathered up the winds in his fists?
PRO.30.4	Who has bound up the waters in his cloak?
PRO.30.4	Who has established all the ends of the earth?
PRO.30.4	What is his name, and what is his son’s name?
PRO.30.5	 Every word of God is purified;
PRO.30.5	he is like
PRO.30.6	 Do not add to his words,
PRO.30.6	lest he reprove you, and prove you to be a liar.
PRO.30.7	 Two things
PRO.30.7	do not refuse me before I die:
PRO.30.8	 Remove falsehood and lies
PRO.30.8	do not give me poverty or riches,
PRO.30.8	feed me with my allotted portion
PRO.30.9	 lest I become satisfied and act deceptively
PRO.30.9	and say, “Who is the 
PRO.30.9	Or lest I become poor and steal
PRO.30.9	and demean
PRO.30.10	 Do not slander
PRO.30.10	lest he curse you, and you are found guilty.
PRO.30.11	 There is a generation
PRO.30.11	and do not bless their mothers.
PRO.30.12	 There is a generation who are pure in their own eyes
PRO.30.12	and yet are not washed
PRO.30.13	 There is a generation whose eyes are so lofty,
PRO.30.13	and whose eyelids are lifted up disdainfully.
PRO.30.14	 There is a generation whose teeth are like
PRO.30.14	and whose molars
PRO.30.14	to devour
PRO.30.14	and the needy from among the human race.
PRO.30.15	 The leech
PRO.30.15	“Give! Give!”
PRO.30.15	There are three things that are never satisfied,
PRO.30.15	four
PRO.30.16	 the grave,
PRO.30.16	land that is not satisfied with water,
PRO.30.16	and fire that never says, “Enough!”
PRO.30.17	 The eye
PRO.30.17	and despises obeying
PRO.30.17	the ravens of the valley will peck it out
PRO.30.17	and the young vultures will eat it.
PRO.30.18	 There are three things that are too wonderful for me,
PRO.30.18	four that I do not understand: 
PRO.30.19	 the way
PRO.30.19	the way of a snake on a rock,
PRO.30.19	the way of a ship in the sea,
PRO.30.19	and the way of a man with a woman.
PRO.30.20	 This is the way
PRO.30.20	she eats and wipes her mouth
PRO.30.20	and says, “I have not done wrong.”
PRO.30.21	 Under three things the earth trembles,
PRO.30.21	and under four things it cannot bear up:
PRO.30.22	 under a servant
PRO.30.22	under a fool who is stuffed with food,
PRO.30.23	 under an unloved
PRO.30.23	and under a female servant who dispossesses
PRO.30.24	 There are four things on earth that are small,
PRO.30.24	but they are exceedingly wise:
PRO.30.25	 ants are creatures with little strength,
PRO.30.25	but they prepare
PRO.30.26	 rock badgers
PRO.30.26	but they make their homes in the crags;
PRO.30.27	 locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	but they all go forward by ranks;
PRO.30.28	 a lizard
PRO.30.28	but it gets into the palaces of the king.
PRO.30.29	 There are three things that are magnificent
PRO.30.29	four things that move about magnificently:
PRO.30.30	 a lion, mightiest
PRO.30.30	who does not retreat from anything;
PRO.30.31	 a strutting rooster,
PRO.30.31	and a king with his army around him.
PRO.30.32	 If you have done foolishly by exalting yourself
PRO.30.32	or if you have planned evil,
PRO.30.32	put

PRO.31.4	it is not for kings to drink wine,
PRO.31.4	or for rulers to crave strong drink,
PRO.31.5	 lest they drink and forget what is decreed,
PRO.31.5	and remove
PRO.31.6	 Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,
PRO.31.6	and wine to those who are bitterly distressed;
PRO.31.7	 let them
PRO.31.7	and remember their misery no more.
PRO.31.8	 Open your mouth
PRO.31.8	for the legal rights of all the dying.
PRO.31.9	 Open your mouth, judge in righteousness,

PRO.31.22	 She makes for herself coverlets;
PRO.31.22	her clothing is fine linen and purple.
PRO.31.23	 Her husband is well-known
PRO.31.23	when he sits with the elders
PRO.31.24	 She makes linen garments
PRO.31.24	and supplies the merchants
PRO.31.25	 She is clothed

ECC.1.11	they will not be remembered by the future generations.
ECC.1.12	 I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
ECC.1.13	 I decided
ECC.1.13	all that has been accomplished on earth.
ECC.1.13	I concluded:
ECC.1.13	that keeps them
ECC.1.14	 I reflected on everything that is accomplished by man
ECC.1.14	and I concluded: Everything
ECC.1.15	 What is bent
ECC.1.15	and what is missing
ECC.1.16	 I thought to myself,
ECC.1.16	“I have become much wiser
ECC.1.16	 I
ECC.1.17	 So I decided
ECC.1.17	however, I concluded
ECC.1.18	 For with great wisdom comes
ECC.1.18	whoever increases his
ECC.2.1	 I thought to myself,
ECC.2.1	“Come now,
ECC.2.1	But I found
ECC.2.2	 I said of partying,
ECC.2.2	and of self-indulgent pleasure,
ECC.2.3	 I thought deeply
ECC.2.3	(all the while
ECC.2.3	and the effects of
ECC.2.3	so that
ECC.2.3	for people
ECC.2.4	 I increased my possessions:
ECC.2.4	I built houses for myself;
ECC.2.4	I planted vineyards for myself.
ECC.2.5	 I designed
ECC.2.5	and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
ECC.2.6	 I constructed pools of water for myself,
ECC.2.6	to irrigate my grove
ECC.2.7	 I purchased male and female slaves,
ECC.2.7	and I owned slaves who were born in my house;
ECC.2.7	I also possessed more livestock – both herds and flocks – 
ECC.2.7	than any of my predecessors in Jerusalem.
ECC.2.8	 I also amassed silver and gold for myself,
ECC.2.8	as well as valuable treasures
ECC.2.8	I acquired male singers and female singers for myself,
ECC.2.8	and what gives a man sensual delight
ECC.2.9	 So
ECC.2.9	yet I maintained my objectivity:
ECC.2.10	 I did not restrain myself from getting whatever I wanted;
ECC.2.10	I did not deny myself anything that would bring me pleasure.
ECC.2.10	So all my accomplishments gave me joy;
ECC.2.10	this was my reward for all my effort.
ECC.2.11	 Yet when I reflected on everything I had accomplished
ECC.2.11	and on all the effort that I had expended to accomplish it,
ECC.2.11	I concluded:
ECC.2.11	like chasing the wind!
ECC.2.11	There is nothing gained
ECC.2.12	 Next, I decided to consider
ECC.2.12	For what more can the king’s successor do than what the king
ECC.2.13	 I realized that wisdom is preferable to folly,
ECC.2.13	just as light is preferable to darkness:
ECC.2.14	 The wise man can see where he is going,
ECC.2.14	Yet I also realized that the same fate
ECC.2.15	 So I thought to myself, “The fate of the fool will happen even to me!
ECC.2.15	Then what did I gain by becoming so excessively
ECC.2.15	So I lamented to myself,
ECC.2.15	“The benefits of wisdom
ECC.2.16	 For the wise man, like
ECC.2.16	because
ECC.2.16	Alas,
ECC.2.17	 So I loathed
ECC.2.17	happens
ECC.2.17	for all the benefits of wisdom
ECC.2.18	 So I loathed all the fruit of
ECC.2.18	for which I worked so hard
ECC.2.18	because
ECC.2.19	 Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool?
ECC.2.19	Yet
ECC.2.19	for which I worked so wisely
ECC.2.19	This also is futile!
ECC.2.20	 So I began to despair
ECC.2.20	for which I worked so hard
ECC.2.21	 For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge, and skill;
ECC.2.21	however, he must hand over
ECC.2.21	to someone else who did not work for it.
ECC.2.21	This also is futile, and an awful injustice!
ECC.2.22	 What does a man acquire from all his labor
ECC.2.22	and from the anxiety that accompanies his toil on earth?
ECC.2.23	 For all day long
ECC.2.23	and even at night his mind cannot relax!
ECC.2.23	This also is futile!
ECC.2.24	 There is nothing better for
ECC.2.24	and to find enjoyment
ECC.2.24	I also perceived that this ability to find enjoyment
ECC.2.25	 For no one
ECC.2.25	or experience joy
ECC.2.26	 For to the one who pleases him,
ECC.2.26	but to the sinner, he gives the task of amassing
ECC.2.26	only to give
ECC.2.26	This
ECC.3.1	 For everything
ECC.3.1	and an appropriate time
ECC.3.2	 A time to be born,
ECC.3.2	a time to plant, and a time to uproot what was planted;
ECC.3.3	 A time to kill, and a time to heal;
ECC.3.3	a time to break down, and a time to build up;
ECC.3.4	 A time to weep, and a time to laugh;
ECC.3.4	a time to mourn, and a time to dance.
ECC.3.5	 A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones;
ECC.3.5	a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
ECC.3.6	 A time to search, and a time to give something up as lost;
ECC.3.6	a time to keep, and a time to throw away;
ECC.3.7	 A time to rip, and a time to sew;
ECC.3.7	a time to keep silent, and a time to speak.
ECC.3.8	 A time to love, and a time to hate;
ECC.3.8	a time for war, and a time for peace.
ECC.3.9	 What benefit can a worker
ECC.3.10	 I have observed the burden
ECC.3.10	that God has given to people
ECC.3.11	 God has made everything fit beautifully
ECC.3.11	but
ECC.3.11	so that
ECC.3.11	from the beginning to the end
ECC.3.12	 I have concluded
ECC.3.12	than
ECC.3.12	themselves
ECC.3.13	 and also that everyone should eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all his toil,
ECC.3.13	for these things
ECC.3.14	 I also know that whatever God does will endure forever;
ECC.3.14	nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken away from it.
ECC.3.14	God has made it this way, so that men will fear him.
ECC.3.15	 Whatever exists now has already been, and whatever will be has already been;
ECC.3.15	for God will seek to do again
ECC.3.16	 I saw something else on earth:
ECC.3.16	In the place of justice, there was wickedness,
ECC.3.16	and in the place of fairness,
ECC.3.17	 I thought to myself, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked;
ECC.3.17	for there is an appropriate time for every activity,
ECC.3.17	and there is a time of judgment
ECC.3.18	 I also thought to myself, “It is
ECC.3.18	so God can clearly
ECC.3.19	 For the fate of humans
ECC.3.19	As one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath.
ECC.3.19	There is no advantage for humans over animals,
ECC.3.19	for both are fleeting.
ECC.3.20	 Both go to the same place,
ECC.3.20	both come from the dust,
ECC.3.20	and to dust both return.
ECC.3.21	 Who really knows if the human spirit
ECC.3.21	and the animal’s spirit descends into the earth?
ECC.3.22	 So I perceived there is nothing better than for people
ECC.3.22	because that is their
ECC.3.22	for who can show them what the future holds?
ECC.4.1	 So
ECC.4.1	This is what I saw:
ECC.4.1	The oppressed
ECC.4.1	no one delivers
ECC.4.2	 So I considered
ECC.4.2	more fortunate than those who are still alive.
ECC.4.3	 But better than both is the one who has not been born
ECC.4.3	and has not seen the evil things that are done on earth.
ECC.4.4	 Then I considered
ECC.4.4	Surely it is nothing more than
ECC.4.4	This also is profitless – like
ECC.4.5	 The fool folds his hands and does no work,
ECC.4.5	so he has nothing to eat but his own flesh.
ECC.4.6	 Better is one handful with some rest
ECC.4.6	than two hands full of toil
ECC.4.7	 So
ECC.4.8	 A man who is all alone with no companion,
ECC.4.8	he has no children nor siblings;
ECC.4.8	yet there is no end to all his toil,
ECC.4.8	and he
ECC.4.8	He laments,
ECC.4.8	This also is futile and a burdensome task!
ECC.4.9	 Two people are better than one,
ECC.4.9	because they can reap
ECC.4.10	 For if they fall, one will help his companion up,
ECC.4.10	but pity
ECC.4.11	 Furthermore, if two lie down together, they can keep each other warm,
ECC.4.11	but how can one person keep warm by himself?
ECC.4.12	 Although an assailant may overpower
ECC.4.12	two can withstand him.
ECC.4.12	Moreover, a three-stranded cord is not quickly broken.
ECC.4.13	 A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king
ECC.4.13	who no longer knows how to receive advice.
ECC.4.14	 For he came out of prison
ECC.4.14	even though he had been born poor in what would become his
ECC.4.15	 I considered all the living who walk on earth,
ECC.4.15	as well as the successor
ECC.4.16	 There is no end to all the people
ECC.4.16	yet future generations
ECC.4.16	This also is profitless and like
ECC.5.1	 Be careful what you do
ECC.5.1	draw near to listen
ECC.5.1	for they do not realize that they are doing wrong.
ECC.5.2	 Do not be rash with your mouth or hasty in your heart to bring up a matter before God,
ECC.5.2	for God is in heaven and you are on earth!
ECC.5.2	Therefore, let your words be few.
ECC.5.3	 Just as dreams come when there are many cares,
ECC.5.3	so
ECC.5.4	 When you make a vow
ECC.5.4	For God
ECC.5.4	Pay what you vow!
ECC.5.5	 It is better for you not to vow
ECC.5.5	than to vow and not pay it.
ECC.5.6	 Do not let your mouth cause you
ECC.5.6	and do not tell the priest,
ECC.5.6	Why make God angry at you
ECC.5.6	so that he would destroy the work of your hands?”
ECC.5.7	 Just as there is futility in many dreams,
ECC.5.7	so also in many words.
ECC.5.7	Therefore, fear God!
ECC.5.8	 If you see the extortion
ECC.5.8	or the perversion
ECC.5.8	do not be astonished by the matter.
ECC.5.8	For the high official is watched by a higher official,
ECC.5.8	and there are higher ones over them!
ECC.5.9	 The produce of the land is seized
ECC.5.9	even the king is served
ECC.5.10	 The one who loves money
ECC.5.10	he who loves wealth
ECC.5.10	This also is futile.
ECC.5.11	 When someone’s
ECC.5.11	so what does its owner
ECC.5.12	 The sleep of the laborer is pleasant – whether he eats little or much – 
ECC.5.12	but the wealth of the rich will not allow him to sleep.
ECC.5.13	 Here is
ECC.5.13	Wealth hoarded by its owner to his own misery.
ECC.5.14	 Then that wealth was lost through bad luck;
ECC.5.14	although he fathered a son, he has nothing left to give him.
ECC.5.15	 Just as he came forth from his mother's womb, naked will he return as he came,
ECC.5.15	and he will take nothing in his hand that he may carry away from his toil.
ECC.5.16	 This is another misfortune:
ECC.5.16	Just as he came, so will he go.
ECC.5.16	What did he gain from toiling for the wind?
ECC.5.17	 Surely, he ate in darkness every day of his life,
ECC.5.17	and he suffered greatly with sickness and anger.
ECC.5.18	 I have seen personally what is the only beneficial and appropriate course of action for people:
ECC.5.18	to eat and drink,
ECC.5.18	during the few days of their life which God has given them,
ECC.5.18	for this is their reward.
ECC.5.19	 To every man whom God has given wealth, and possessions,
ECC.5.19	he has also given him the ability
ECC.5.19	to eat from them, to receive his reward and to find enjoyment in his toil;
ECC.5.19	these things
ECC.5.20	 For he does not think
ECC.5.20	because God keeps him preoccupied
ECC.6.1	 Here is
ECC.6.1	and it weighs
ECC.6.2	 God gives a man riches, property, and wealth
ECC.6.2	so that he lacks nothing that his heart
ECC.6.2	yet God does not enable
ECC.6.2	instead, someone else
ECC.6.2	This is fruitless and a grave misfortune.
ECC.6.3	 Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years – 
ECC.6.3	even if he lives a long, long time,
ECC.6.3	even if he were to live forever
ECC.6.3	I would say, “A stillborn child
ECC.6.4	 Though the stillborn child
ECC.6.4	though its name is shrouded in darkness,
ECC.6.5	 though it never saw the light of day
ECC.6.5	yet it has more rest
ECC.6.6	 if he should live a thousand years twice, yet does not enjoy his prosperity.
ECC.6.6	For both of them die!
ECC.6.7	 All of man’s labor is for nothing more than
ECC.6.7	yet his appetite
ECC.6.8	 So what advantage does a wise man have over a fool?
ECC.6.8	And what advantage
ECC.6.9	 It is better to be content with
ECC.6.9	than for one’s heart always to crave more.
ECC.6.9	This continual longing
ECC.6.10	 Whatever has happened was foreordained,
ECC.6.10	and what happens to a person
ECC.6.10	It is useless for him to argue with God about his fate
ECC.6.10	because God is more powerful than he is.
ECC.6.11	 The more one argues with words, the less he accomplishes.
ECC.6.11	How does that benefit him?
ECC.6.12	 For no one knows what is best for a person during his life
ECC.6.12	during the few days of his fleeting life – 
ECC.6.12	for
ECC.6.12	Nor can anyone tell him what the future will hold for him on earth.
ECC.7.1	 A good reputation
ECC.7.1	likewise,
ECC.7.2	 It is better to go to a funeral
ECC.7.2	than a feast.
ECC.7.2	For death
ECC.7.2	and the living should
ECC.7.3	 Sorrow
ECC.7.3	because sober reflection
ECC.7.4	 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
ECC.7.4	but the heart of fools is in the house of merrymaking.
ECC.7.5	 It is better for a person to receive
ECC.7.5	than to listen to the song
ECC.7.6	 For like the crackling of quick-burning thorns
ECC.7.6	so is the laughter of the fool.
ECC.7.6	This kind of folly
ECC.7.7	 Surely oppression
ECC.7.7	likewise,
ECC.7.8	 The end of a matter
ECC.7.8	likewise, patience
ECC.7.9	 Do not let yourself be quickly provoked,
ECC.7.9	for anger resides in the lap
ECC.7.10	 Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these days?”
ECC.7.10	for it is not wise to ask that.
ECC.7.11	 Wisdom, like
ECC.7.11	it benefits those who see the light of day.
ECC.7.12	 For wisdom provides
ECC.7.12	just as
ECC.7.12	But the advantage of knowledge is this:
ECC.7.12	Wisdom preserves the life
ECC.7.13	 Consider the work of God:
ECC.7.13	For who can make straight what he has bent?
ECC.7.14	 In times of prosperity
ECC.7.14	but in times of adversity
ECC.7.14	God has made one as well as the other,
ECC.7.14	so that no one can discover what the future holds.
ECC.7.15	 During the days of my fleeting life
ECC.7.15	Sometimes
ECC.7.15	and sometimes
ECC.7.16	 So do not be excessively righteous or excessively
ECC.7.16	otherwise
ECC.7.17	 Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool;
ECC.7.17	otherwise
ECC.7.18	 It is best to take hold of one warning
ECC.7.18	for the one who fears God will follow
ECC.7.19	 Wisdom gives a wise person more protection
ECC.7.19	than ten rulers in a city.
ECC.7.20	 For
ECC.7.20	who continually does good and never sins.
ECC.7.21	 Also, do not pay attention to everything that people
ECC.7.21	otherwise,
ECC.7.22	 For you know in your own heart
ECC.7.22	that you also have cursed others many times.
ECC.7.23	 I have examined all this by wisdom;
ECC.7.23	I said, “I am determined
ECC.7.24	 Whatever has happened is beyond human
ECC.7.24	it is far deeper than anyone can fathom.
ECC.7.25	 I tried
ECC.7.25	the role of
ECC.7.25	and to understand the stupidity of wickedness
ECC.7.26	 I discovered this:
ECC.7.26	More bitter than death is the kind of
ECC.7.26	her heart is like a hunter’s net and her hands are like prison chains.
ECC.7.26	The man who pleases God escapes her,
ECC.7.26	but the sinner is captured by her.
ECC.7.27	 The Teacher says:
ECC.7.27	I discovered this while trying to discover the scheme of things, item by item.
ECC.7.28	 What I have continually sought, I have not found;
ECC.7.28	I have found only
ECC.7.28	but I have not found one upright woman among all of them.
ECC.7.29	 This alone have I discovered: God made humankind upright,
ECC.7.29	but they have sought many evil schemes.
ECC.8.1	 Who is
ECC.8.1	A person’s wisdom brightens his appearance,
ECC.8.2	 Obey the king’s command,
ECC.8.2	because you took
ECC.8.3	 Do not rush out of the king’s presence in haste – do not delay when the matter is unpleasant,
ECC.8.3	for he can do whatever he pleases.
ECC.8.4	 Surely the king’s authority
ECC.8.4	no one can say
ECC.8.5	 Whoever obeys his
ECC.8.5	and a wise person
ECC.8.6	 For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,
ECC.8.6	for the oppression
ECC.8.7	 Surely no one knows the future,
ECC.8.7	and no one can tell another person what will happen.
ECC.8.8	 Just as no one has power over the wind to restrain it,
ECC.8.8	so no one has power over the day of his
ECC.8.8	Just as no one can be discharged during the battle,
ECC.8.8	so wickedness cannot rescue the wicked.
ECC.8.9	 While applying
ECC.8.9	Sometimes one person
ECC.8.10	 Not only that,
ECC.8.10	and as they left the holy temple,
ECC.8.10	boasted
ECC.8.10	This also is an enigma.
ECC.8.11	 When
ECC.8.11	the human heart
ECC.8.12	 Even though a sinner might commit a hundred crimes
ECC.8.12	yet I know that it will go well with God-fearing people
ECC.8.13	 But it will not go well with the wicked,
ECC.8.13	nor will they
ECC.8.13	because they
ECC.8.14	 Here is
ECC.8.14	Sometimes there are righteous people who get what the wicked deserve,
ECC.8.14	and sometimes there are wicked people who get what the righteous deserve.
ECC.8.14	I said, “This also is an enigma.”
ECC.8.15	 So I recommend the enjoyment of life,
ECC.8.15	for there is nothing better on earth
ECC.8.15	So
ECC.8.15	during the days of his life which God gives him on earth.
ECC.8.16	 When I tried
ECC.8.16	and to observe the activity
ECC.8.16	even though it prevents anyone from sleeping day or night
ECC.8.17	 then I discerned all that God has done:
ECC.8.17	No one really comprehends what happens
ECC.8.17	Despite all human
ECC.8.17	Even if
ECC.8.17	he would not really comprehend
ECC.9.1	 So I reflected on all this,
ECC.9.1	I concluded that
ECC.9.1	whether a person will be loved or hated
ECC.9.1	no one knows what lies ahead.
ECC.9.2	 Everyone shares the same fate
ECC.9.2	the righteous and the wicked,
ECC.9.2	the good and the bad,
ECC.9.2	the ceremonially clean and unclean,
ECC.9.2	those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.
ECC.9.2	What happens to the good person, also happens to the sinner;
ECC.9.2	what happens to those who make vows, also happens to those who are afraid to make vows.
ECC.9.3	 This is the unfortunate fact
ECC.9.3	the same fate awaits
ECC.9.3	In addition to this, the hearts of all people
ECC.9.3	and there is folly in their hearts during their lives – then they die.
ECC.9.4	 But whoever is among
ECC.9.4	a live dog is better than a dead lion.
ECC.9.5	 For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything;
ECC.9.5	they have no further reward – and even the memory of them disappears.
ECC.9.6	 What they loved,
ECC.9.6	and they no longer have a part in anything that happens on earth.
ECC.9.7	 Go, eat your food
ECC.9.7	and drink your wine with a happy heart,
ECC.9.7	because God has already approved your works.
ECC.9.8	 Let your clothes always be white,
ECC.9.8	and do not spare precious ointment on your head.
ECC.9.9	 Enjoy
ECC.9.9	that God
ECC.9.9	for that is your reward in life and in your burdensome work
ECC.9.10	 Whatever you find to do with your hands,
ECC.9.10	do it with all your might,
ECC.9.10	because there is neither work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave,
ECC.9.10	the place where you will eventually go.
ECC.9.11	 Again,
ECC.9.11	the race is not always
ECC.9.11	the battle is not always won by the strongest;
ECC.9.11	prosperity
ECC.9.11	wealth does not always belong to those who are the most discerning,
ECC.9.11	nor does success
ECC.9.11	for time and chance may overcome
ECC.9.12	 Surely, no one
ECC.9.12	Like fish that are caught in a deadly
ECC.9.12	just like them, all people
ECC.9.13	 This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth,
ECC.9.13	and it is a great burden
ECC.9.14	 There was once
ECC.9.14	and a mighty king attacked it, besieging
ECC.9.15	 However, a poor but wise man lived in the city,
ECC.9.15	and he could have delivered
ECC.9.15	but no one listened
ECC.9.16	 So I concluded that wisdom is better than might,
ECC.9.16	but a poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens
ECC.9.17	 The words of the wise are heard in quiet,
ECC.9.17	more than the shouting of a ruler is heard
ECC.9.18	 Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
ECC.9.18	but one sinner can destroy much that is good.
ECC.10.1	 One dead fly
ECC.10.1	so a little folly can outweigh
ECC.10.2	 A wise person’s good sense protects him,
ECC.10.2	but a fool’s lack of sense leaves him vulnerable.
ECC.10.3	 Even when a fool walks along the road he lacks sense,
ECC.10.3	and shows
ECC.10.4	 If the anger
ECC.10.4	for a calm
ECC.10.5	 I have seen another
ECC.10.5	It is an error a ruler makes.
ECC.10.6	 Fools
ECC.10.6	while wealthy men sit in lowly positions.
ECC.10.7	 I have seen slaves
ECC.10.7	and princes walking on foot
ECC.10.8	 One who digs a pit may
ECC.10.8	and one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
ECC.10.9	 One who quarries stones may be injured by them;
ECC.10.9	one who splits logs may be endangered by them.
ECC.10.10	 If an iron axhead
ECC.10.10	he must exert a great deal of effort;
ECC.10.10	so wisdom has the advantage of giving success.
ECC.10.11	 If the snake should bite before it is charmed,
ECC.10.11	the snake charmer
ECC.10.12	 The words of a wise person
ECC.10.12	but the words
ECC.10.13	 At the beginning his words
ECC.10.13	and at the end
ECC.10.14	 yet a fool keeps on babbling.
ECC.10.14	No one knows what will happen;
ECC.10.14	who can tell him what will happen in the future?
ECC.10.15	 The toil of a stupid fool
ECC.10.15	because he does not even know the way to the city.
ECC.10.16	 Woe to you, O land, when your king is childish,
ECC.10.16	and your princes feast in the morning!
ECC.10.17	 Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobility,
ECC.10.17	and your princes feast at the proper time
ECC.10.18	 Because of laziness the roof
ECC.10.18	and because of idle hands
ECC.10.19	 Feasts
ECC.10.19	and wine makes life merry,
ECC.10.19	but money is the answer
ECC.10.20	 Do not curse a king even in your thoughts,
ECC.10.20	and do not curse the rich
ECC.10.20	for a bird
ECC.10.20	or some winged creature
ECC.11.1	 Send
ECC.11.1	for after many days you will get a return.
ECC.11.2	 Divide your merchandise
ECC.11.2	for you do not know
ECC.11.3	 If the clouds are full of rain, they will empty themselves on the earth,
ECC.11.3	and whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, the tree will lie wherever it falls.
ECC.11.4	 He who watches the wind will not sow,
ECC.11.4	and he who observes the clouds will not reap.
ECC.11.5	 Just as you do not know the path
ECC.11.5	or how the bones form
ECC.11.5	so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
ECC.11.6	 Sow your seed in the morning,
ECC.11.6	and do not stop working
ECC.11.6	for you do not know which activity
ECC.11.6	whether this one or that one, or whether both will prosper equally.
ECC.11.7	 Light
ECC.11.7	and it is pleasant for a person
ECC.11.8	 So, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all,
ECC.11.8	but let him remember that the days of darkness
ECC.11.9	 Rejoice, young man, while you are young,
ECC.11.9	and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth.
ECC.11.9	Follow the impulses
ECC.11.9	but know that God will judge your motives and actions.
ECC.11.10	 Banish
ECC.11.10	and put away pain
ECC.11.10	for youth
ECC.12.1	 So remember
ECC.12.1	before
ECC.12.1	and the years draw near when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;
ECC.12.2	 before the sun and the light
ECC.12.2	and the clouds disappear
ECC.12.3	 when those who keep watch over the house
ECC.12.3	and the virile men begin to stoop over,
ECC.12.3	and the grinders
ECC.12.3	and those who look through the windows grow dim,
ECC.12.4	 and the doors along the street are shut;
ECC.12.4	when the sound of the grinding mill
ECC.12.4	and one is awakened
ECC.12.4	and all their
ECC.12.5	 and they are afraid of heights and the dangers
ECC.12.5	the almond blossoms
ECC.12.5	and the grasshopper
ECC.12.5	and the caper berry
ECC.12.5	because man goes to his eternal home,
ECC.12.5	and the mourners go about in the streets – 
ECC.12.6	 before the silver cord is removed,
ECC.12.6	or the golden bowl is broken,
ECC.12.6	or the pitcher is shattered at the well,
ECC.12.6	or the water wheel
ECC.12.7	 and the dust returns to the earth as it was,
ECC.12.7	and the life’s breath
ECC.12.8	 “Absolutely futile!”
ECC.12.8	“All of these things
ECC.12.9	 Not only was the Teacher wise,
ECC.12.9	but he also taught knowledge to the people;
ECC.12.9	he carefully evaluated
ECC.12.10	 The Teacher sought to find delightful
ECC.12.10	and to write
ECC.12.11	 The words of the sages are like prods,
ECC.12.11	and the collected sayings are like firmly fixed nails;
ECC.12.11	they are given by one shepherd.
ECC.12.12	 Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.
ECC.12.12	There is no end to the making
ECC.12.12	and much study is exhausting to the body.
ECC.12.13	 Having heard everything, I have reached this conclusion:
ECC.12.13	Fear God and keep his commandments,
ECC.12.13	because this is the whole duty
ECC.12.14	 For God will evaluate every deed,
ECC.12.14	including every secret thing, whether good or evil.

SNG.1.5	dark
SNG.1.5	lovely
SNG.1.6	 Do not stare at me because
SNG.1.6	for
SNG.1.6	My brothers
SNG.1.6	they made me the keeper of the vineyards.
SNG.1.6	Alas, my own vineyard
SNG.1.7	 Tell me, O you whom my heart
SNG.1.7	where do you pasture your sheep?
SNG.1.7	Where do you rest your sheep during the midday heat?
SNG.1.7	Tell me lest
SNG.1.7	beside the flocks of your companions!
SNG.1.8	 If you do not know, O most beautiful of women,
SNG.1.8	simply follow the tracks of my flock,
SNG.1.8	and pasture your little lambs
SNG.1.8	beside the tents of the shepherds.
SNG.1.9	 O my beloved, you are like
SNG.1.9	among Pharaoh’s stallions.
SNG.1.10	 Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments;
SNG.1.10	your neck is lovely
SNG.1.11	 We
SNG.1.11	studded with silver.
SNG.1.12	 While the king was at his banqueting table,
SNG.1.12	my nard
SNG.1.13	 My beloved is like a fragrant pouch of myrrh
SNG.1.13	spending the night
SNG.1.14	 My beloved is like a cluster of henna blossoms
SNG.1.14	in the vineyards of En-Gedi.
SNG.1.15	 Oh,
SNG.1.15	Oh, how beautiful you are!
SNG.1.15	Your eyes
SNG.1.16	 Oh, how handsome you are, my lover!
SNG.1.16	Oh,
SNG.1.16	The lush foliage
SNG.1.17	 the cedars are the beams of our bedroom chamber;
SNG.1.17	the pines are the rafters of our bedroom.
SNG.2.1	 I am a
SNG.2.1	a lily
SNG.2.2	 Like
SNG.2.2	so is my darling among the maidens.
SNG.2.3	 Like
SNG.2.3	so is my beloved among the young men.
SNG.2.3	I delight
SNG.2.3	and his fruit
SNG.2.4	 He brought me
SNG.2.4	and he looked
SNG.2.5	 Sustain
SNG.2.5	refresh me with apples,
SNG.2.5	for I am faint with love.
SNG.2.6	 His left hand caresses my head,
SNG.2.6	and his right hand stimulates me.
SNG.2.7	 I adjure you,
SNG.2.7	by the gazelles and by the young does
SNG.2.7	Do not awaken or arouse
SNG.2.8	 Listen!
SNG.2.8	Look!
SNG.2.8	leaping over the mountains,
SNG.2.8	bounding over the hills!
SNG.2.9	 My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag.
SNG.2.9	Look! There he stands behind our wall,
SNG.2.9	gazing through the window,
SNG.2.9	peering through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	 My lover spoke to me, saying:
SNG.2.10	“Arise, my darling;
SNG.2.10	My beautiful one, come away with me!
SNG.2.11	 Look! The winter has passed,
SNG.2.11	the winter rains are over and gone.
SNG.2.12	 The pomegranates have appeared
SNG.2.12	the time for pruning and singing
SNG.2.12	the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
SNG.2.13	 The fig tree has budded,
SNG.2.13	the vines have blossomed and give off their fragrance.
SNG.2.13	Arise, come away my darling;
SNG.2.13	my beautiful one, come away with me!”
SNG.2.14	 O my dove,
SNG.2.14	in the hiding places of the mountain crags,
SNG.2.14	let me see your face,
SNG.2.14	let me hear your voice;
SNG.2.14	for your voice is sweet,
SNG.2.14	and your face is lovely.
SNG.2.15	 Catch
SNG.2.15	the little foxes,
SNG.2.15	that ruin the vineyards
SNG.2.15	for our vineyard is in bloom.
SNG.2.16	 My lover is mine and I am his;
SNG.2.16	he grazes among the lilies.
SNG.2.17	 Until the dawn arrives
SNG.2.17	turn,
SNG.2.17	be like a gazelle or a young stag
SNG.2.17	on the mountain gorges.
SNG.3.1	 All night long
SNG.3.1	I longed for
SNG.3.1	I longed for
SNG.3.2	 “I will arise
SNG.3.2	and throughout the streets
SNG.3.2	I will search for my beloved.”
SNG.3.2	I searched for him but I did not find him.
SNG.3.3	 The night watchmen found me – the ones who guard the city walls.
SNG.3.3	“Have you seen my beloved?”
SNG.3.4	 Scarcely
SNG.3.4	when I found my beloved!
SNG.3.4	I held onto him
SNG.3.4	until I brought him to my mother’s house,
SNG.3.4	to the bedroom chamber
SNG.3.5	 I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem,
SNG.3.5	by the gazelles and by the young does of the open fields:
SNG.3.5	“Do not awake or arouse love until it pleases!”
SNG.3.6	 Who is this coming up from the desert
SNG.3.6	like a column of smoke,
SNG.3.6	like
SNG.3.6	every kind of fragrant powder
SNG.3.7	 Look! It is Solomon’s portable couch!
SNG.3.7	It is surrounded by sixty warriors,
SNG.3.7	some of Israel’s mightiest warriors.
SNG.3.8	 All of them are skilled with a sword,
SNG.3.8	well-trained in the art of warfare.
SNG.3.8	Each has his sword at his side,
SNG.3.8	to guard against the terrors of the night.
SNG.3.9	 King Solomon made a sedan chair
SNG.3.9	of wood imported from Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	 Its posts were made
SNG.3.10	its back
SNG.3.10	Its seat was upholstered with purple wool;
SNG.3.10	its interior was inlaid
SNG.3.11	 Come out, O maidens of Zion,
SNG.3.11	and gaze upon King Solomon!
SNG.3.11	He is wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him
SNG.3.11	on his wedding day,
SNG.3.11	on the most joyous day of his life!
SNG.4.1	 Oh,
SNG.4.1	Oh, you are beautiful!
SNG.4.1	Your eyes behind your veil are like doves.
SNG.4.1	Your hair is like a flock of female goats
SNG.4.1	descending
SNG.4.2	 Your teeth are like a flock of newly-shorn sheep
SNG.4.2	coming up from the washing place;
SNG.4.2	each of them has a twin,
SNG.4.2	and not one of them is missing.
SNG.4.3	 Your lips are like a scarlet thread;
SNG.4.3	your mouth is lovely.
SNG.4.3	Your forehead
SNG.4.3	is like a slice of pomegranate.
SNG.4.4	 Your neck is like the tower
SNG.4.4	built with courses of stones;
SNG.4.4	one thousand shields are hung on it – 
SNG.4.4	all shields of valiant warriors.
SNG.4.5	 Your two breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.4.5	twins of the gazelle
SNG.4.5	grazing among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	 Until the dawn arrives
SNG.4.6	and the shadows flee,
SNG.4.6	I will go up to the mountain of myrrh,
SNG.4.6	and to the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	 You are altogether beautiful, my darling!
SNG.4.7	There is no blemish in you!
SNG.4.8	 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
SNG.4.8	come with me from Lebanon.
SNG.4.8	Descend from the crest of Amana,
SNG.4.8	from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon,
SNG.4.8	from the lions’ dens
SNG.4.8	and the mountain haunts of the leopards.
SNG.4.9	 You have stolen my heart,
SNG.4.9	You have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes,
SNG.4.9	with one jewel of your necklace.
SNG.4.10	 How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride!
SNG.4.10	How much better is your love than wine;
SNG.4.10	the fragrance of your perfume is better than any spice!
SNG.4.11	 Your lips drip sweetness like the honeycomb, my bride,
SNG.4.11	honey and milk are under your tongue.
SNG.4.11	The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	 You are a locked garden,
SNG.4.12	you are an enclosed spring, a sealed-up fountain.
SNG.4.13	 Your shoots are a royal garden
SNG.4.13	with choice fruits:
SNG.4.13	henna with nard,
SNG.4.14	 nard and saffron;
SNG.4.14	calamus and cinnamon with every kind of spice,
SNG.4.14	myrrh and aloes with all the finest spices.
SNG.4.15	 You are a garden spring,
SNG.4.15	a well
SNG.4.16	 Awake, O north wind; come, O south wind!
SNG.4.16	Blow on my garden so that its fragrant spices may send out their sweet smell.
SNG.4.16	May my beloved come into his garden
SNG.4.16	and eat its delightful fruit!
SNG.5.1	 I have entered my garden, O my sister, my bride;
SNG.5.1	I have gathered my myrrh with my balsam spice.
SNG.5.1	I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;
SNG.5.1	I have drunk my wine and my milk!
SNG.5.1	Eat, friends, and drink!
SNG.5.1	Drink freely, O lovers!
SNG.5.2	 I was asleep, but my mind
SNG.5.2	Listen!
SNG.5.2	“Open
SNG.5.2	my dove, my flawless one!
SNG.5.2	My head is drenched with dew,
SNG.5.2	my hair with the dampness of the night.”
SNG.5.3	 “I have already taken off my robe – must I put it on again?
SNG.5.3	I have already washed my feet – must I soil them again?”
SNG.5.4	 My lover thrust his hand
SNG.5.4	and my feelings
SNG.5.5	 I arose to open for my beloved;
SNG.5.5	my hands dripped with myrrh – 
SNG.5.5	my fingers flowed with myrrh
SNG.5.5	on the handles of the lock.
SNG.5.6	 I opened for my beloved,
SNG.5.6	but my lover had already turned
SNG.5.6	I fell into despair
SNG.5.6	I looked for him but did not find him;
SNG.5.6	I called him but he did not answer me.
SNG.5.7	 The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city.
SNG.5.7	They beat me, they bruised me;
SNG.5.7	they took away my cloak, those watchmen on the walls!
SNG.5.8	 O maidens of Jerusalem, I command you – 
SNG.5.8	If you find my beloved, what will you tell him?
SNG.5.8	Tell him that I am lovesick!
SNG.5.9	 Why is your beloved better than others,
SNG.5.9	O most beautiful of women?
SNG.5.9	Why is your beloved better than others,
SNG.5.9	that you would command us in this manner?
SNG.5.10	 My beloved
SNG.5.10	he stands out
SNG.5.11	 His head is like the most pure gold.
SNG.5.11	His hair is curly
SNG.5.12	 His eyes are like doves by streams of water,
SNG.5.12	washed in milk, mounted like jewels.
SNG.5.13	 His cheeks are like garden beds full of balsam trees
SNG.5.13	His lips are like lilies dripping with drops of myrrh.
SNG.5.14	 His arms are like rods of gold set with chrysolite.
SNG.5.14	His abdomen
SNG.5.15	 His legs are like pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold.
SNG.5.15	His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars.
SNG.5.16	 His mouth is very sweet;
SNG.5.16	he is totally desirable.
SNG.5.16	This is my beloved!
SNG.5.16	This is my companion, O maidens of Jerusalem!
SNG.6.1	 Where has your beloved gone,
SNG.6.1	O most beautiful among women?
SNG.6.1	Where has your beloved turned?
SNG.6.1	Tell us,
SNG.6.2	 My beloved has gone down to his garden,
SNG.6.2	to the flowerbeds of balsam spices,
SNG.6.2	to graze
SNG.6.2	and to gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	 I am my lover’s
SNG.6.3	he grazes among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	 My darling, you are as beautiful as Tirzah,
SNG.6.4	as lovely as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	as awe-inspiring
SNG.6.5	 Turn your eyes away from me – 
SNG.6.5	they overwhelm
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like a flock of goats
SNG.6.5	descending from Mount Gilead.
SNG.6.6	 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep
SNG.6.6	coming up from the washing;
SNG.6.6	each has its twin;
SNG.6.6	not one of them is missing.
SNG.6.7	 Like a slice of pomegranate
SNG.6.7	is your forehead
SNG.6.8	 There may be sixty
SNG.6.8	and eighty concubines,
SNG.6.8	and young women
SNG.6.9	 But she is unique!
SNG.6.9	My dove, my perfect one!
SNG.6.9	She is the special daughter
SNG.6.9	she is the favorite
SNG.6.9	The maidens
SNG.6.9	the queens and concubines praised her:
SNG.6.10	 “Who
SNG.6.10	Beautiful as the moon,
SNG.6.10	awe-inspiring
SNG.6.11	 I went down to the orchard of walnut trees,
SNG.6.11	to look for the blossoms of the valley,
SNG.6.11	to see if the vines had budded
SNG.6.11	or if the pomegranates were in bloom.
SNG.6.12	 I was beside myself with joy!
SNG.6.12	There please give me your myrrh,
SNG.6.12	O daughter of my princely people.
SNG.6.13	Turn, turn, that I
SNG.6.13	Why
SNG.6.13	like the dance of the Mahanaim?
SNG.7.1	O nobleman’s daughter!
SNG.7.1	The curves
SNG.7.1	the work of the hands of a master craftsman.
SNG.7.2	 Your navel
SNG.7.2	may it never lack
SNG.7.2	Your belly
SNG.7.2	encircled
SNG.7.3	 Your two breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.7.3	twins of a gazelle.
SNG.7.4	 Your neck is like a tower made of ivory.
SNG.7.4	Your eyes are the pools in Heshbon
SNG.7.4	by the gate of Bath-Rabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon
SNG.7.4	overlooking Damascus.
SNG.7.5	 Your head crowns
SNG.7.5	The locks of your hair
SNG.7.5	the king is held captive
SNG.7.6	 How beautiful you are! How lovely,
SNG.7.6	O love,
SNG.7.7	 Your stature
SNG.7.7	and your breasts are like clusters of grapes.
SNG.7.8	 I want
SNG.7.8	and take hold of its fruit stalks.
SNG.7.8	May your breasts be like the clusters of grapes,
SNG.7.8	and may the fragrance of your breath be like apricots!
SNG.7.9	 May your mouth
SNG.7.9	flowing smoothly for my beloved,
SNG.7.9	gliding gently over our lips as we sleep together.
SNG.7.10	 I am my beloved’s,
SNG.7.10	and he desires me!
SNG.7.11	 Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside;
SNG.7.11	let us spend the night in the villages.
SNG.7.12	 Let us rise early to go to the vineyards,
SNG.7.12	to see if the vines have budded,
SNG.7.12	to see if their blossoms have opened,
SNG.7.12	if the pomegranates are in bloom – 
SNG.7.12	there I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	 The mandrakes
SNG.7.13	over our door is every delicacy,
SNG.7.13	both new and old, which I have stored up for you, my lover.
SNG.8.1	 Oh, how I wish you were
SNG.8.1	nursing at my mother’s breasts;
SNG.8.1	if I saw
SNG.8.1	surely
SNG.8.2	 I would lead you and bring you to my mother’s house,
SNG.8.2	the one who taught me.
SNG.8.2	I would give you
SNG.8.2	the nectar of my pomegranates.
SNG.8.3	 His left hand caresses my head,
SNG.8.3	and his right hand stimulates me.
SNG.8.4	 I admonish you, O maidens
SNG.8.4	“Do not
SNG.8.5	 Who is this coming up from the desert,
SNG.8.5	leaning on her beloved?
SNG.8.5	Under the apple tree I aroused you;
SNG.8.5	there your mother conceived you,
SNG.8.5	there she who bore you was in labor of childbirth.
SNG.8.6	 Set me like a cylinder seal
SNG.8.6	like a signet
SNG.8.6	For love is as strong as death,
SNG.8.6	passion
SNG.8.6	Its flames burst forth,
SNG.8.6	it is a blazing flame.
SNG.8.7	 Surging waters cannot quench love;
SNG.8.7	floodwaters
SNG.8.7	If someone were to offer all his possessions
SNG.8.7	the offer
SNG.8.8	 We have a little sister,
SNG.8.8	and as yet she has no breasts.
SNG.8.8	What shall we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	on the day when she is spoken for?
SNG.8.9	 If she is a wall,
SNG.8.9	we will build on her a battlement
SNG.8.9	but if she is a door,
SNG.8.9	we will barricade
SNG.8.10	 I was a wall,
SNG.8.10	and my breasts were like fortress towers.
SNG.8.10	Then I found favor
SNG.8.11	 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-Hamon;
SNG.8.11	he leased out
SNG.8.11	Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.
SNG.8.12	 My vineyard,
SNG.8.12	The thousand shekels belong to you, O Solomon,
SNG.8.12	and two hundred shekels belong to those who maintain it for its fruit.
SNG.8.13	 O you who stay in the gardens,
SNG.8.13	my companions are listening attentively
SNG.8.13	let me be the one to
SNG.8.14	 Make haste, my beloved!
SNG.8.14	Be like a gazelle or a young stag
SNG.8.14	on the mountains of spices.
ISA.1.1	 Here is the message about Judah and Jerusalem
ISA.1.2	 Listen, O heavens,
ISA.1.2	pay attention, O earth!
ISA.1.2	For the 
ISA.1.2	“I raised children,
ISA.1.2	but
ISA.1.3	 An ox recognizes its owner,
ISA.1.3	a donkey recognizes where its owner puts its food;
ISA.1.3	but Israel does not recognize me,
ISA.1.3	my people do not understand.”
ISA.1.4	 The sinful nation is as good as dead,
ISA.1.4	the people weighed down by evil deeds.
ISA.1.4	They are offspring who do wrong,
ISA.1.4	children
ISA.1.4	They have abandoned the 
ISA.1.4	and rejected the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.1.4	They are alienated from him.
ISA.1.5	 Why do you insist on being battered?
ISA.1.5	Why do you continue to rebel?
ISA.1.5	Your head has a massive wound,
ISA.1.5	your whole body is weak.
ISA.1.6	 From the soles of your feet to your head,
ISA.1.6	there is no spot that is unharmed.
ISA.1.6	There are only bruises, cuts,
ISA.1.6	and open wounds.
ISA.1.6	They have not been cleansed
ISA.1.6	nor have they been treated
ISA.1.7	 Your land is devastated,
ISA.1.7	your cities burned with fire.
ISA.1.7	Right before your eyes your crops
ISA.1.7	are being destroyed by foreign invaders.
ISA.1.7	They leave behind devastation and destruction.
ISA.1.8	 Daughter Zion
ISA.1.8	like a hut in a vineyard,
ISA.1.8	or a shelter in a cucumber field;
ISA.1.8	she is a besieged city.
ISA.1.9	 If the 
ISA.1.9	we would have quickly become like Sodom,
ISA.1.9	we would have become like Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	 Listen to the 
ISA.1.10	you leaders of Sodom!
ISA.1.10	Pay attention to our God’s rebuke,
ISA.1.10	people of Gomorrah!
ISA.1.11	 “Of what importance to me are your many sacrifices?”
ISA.1.11	says the 
ISA.1.11	“I am stuffed with
ISA.1.11	of rams and the fat from steers.
ISA.1.11	The blood of bulls, lambs, and goats
ISA.1.11	I do not want.
ISA.1.12	 When you enter my presence,
ISA.1.12	do you actually think I want this – 
ISA.1.12	animals trampling on my courtyards?
ISA.1.13	 Do not bring any more meaningless
ISA.1.13	I consider your incense detestable!
ISA.1.13	You observe new moon festivals, Sabbaths, and convocations,
ISA.1.13	but I cannot tolerate sin-stained celebrations!
ISA.1.14	 I hate your new moon festivals and assemblies;
ISA.1.14	they are a burden
ISA.1.14	that I am tired of carrying.
ISA.1.15	 When you spread out your hands in prayer,
ISA.1.15	I look the other way;
ISA.1.15	when you offer your many prayers,
ISA.1.15	I do not listen,
ISA.1.15	because your hands are covered with blood.
ISA.1.16	 Wash! Cleanse yourselves!
ISA.1.16	Remove your sinful deeds
ISA.1.16	from my sight.
ISA.1.16	Stop sinning!
ISA.1.17	 Learn to do what is right!
ISA.1.17	Promote justice!
ISA.1.17	Give the oppressed reason to celebrate!
ISA.1.17	Take up the cause of the orphan!
ISA.1.17	Defend the rights of the widow!
ISA.1.18	 Come, let’s consider your options,”
ISA.1.18	“Though your sins have stained you like the color red,
ISA.1.18	you can become
ISA.1.18	though they are as easy to see as the color scarlet,
ISA.1.18	you can become
ISA.1.19	 If you have a willing attitude and obey,
ISA.1.19	then you will again eat the good crops of the land.
ISA.1.20	 But if you refuse and rebel,
ISA.1.20	you will be devoured
ISA.1.20	Know for certain that the 
ISA.1.21	 How tragic that the once-faithful city
ISA.1.21	has become a prostitute!
ISA.1.21	She was once a center of
ISA.1.21	fairness resided in her,
ISA.1.21	but now only murderers.
ISA.1.22	 Your
ISA.1.22	your beer is diluted with water.
ISA.1.23	 Your officials are rebels,
ISA.1.23	they associate with
ISA.1.23	All of them love bribery,
ISA.1.23	and look for
ISA.1.23	They do not take up the cause of the orphan,
ISA.1.23	or defend the rights of the widow.
ISA.1.24	 Therefore, the sovereign 
ISA.1.24	the powerful ruler of Israel,
ISA.1.24	“Ah, I will seek vengeance
ISA.1.24	I will take revenge against my enemies.
ISA.1.25	 I will attack you;
ISA.1.25	I will purify your metal with flux.
ISA.1.25	I will remove all your slag.
ISA.1.26	 I will reestablish honest judges as in former times,
ISA.1.26	wise advisers as in earlier days.
ISA.1.26	Then you will be called, ‘The Just City,
ISA.1.26	Faithful Town.’”
ISA.1.27	 Zion will be freed by justice,
ISA.1.27	and her returnees by righteousness.
ISA.1.28	 All rebellious sinners will be shattered,
ISA.1.28	those who abandon the 
ISA.1.29	 Indeed, they
ISA.1.29	you
ISA.1.29	you will be embarrassed because of the sacred orchards
ISA.1.29	where you choose to worship.
ISA.1.30	 For you will be like a tree whose leaves wither,
ISA.1.30	like an orchard
ISA.1.31	 The powerful will be like
ISA.1.31	their deeds like a spark;
ISA.1.31	both will burn together,
ISA.1.31	and no one will put out the fire.
ISA.2.1	 Here is the message about Judah and Jerusalem
ISA.2.2	 In the future
ISA.2.2	the mountain of the 
ISA.2.2	as the most important of mountains,
ISA.2.2	and will be the most prominent of hills.
ISA.2.2	All the nations will stream to it,
ISA.2.3	 many peoples will come and say,
ISA.2.3	“Come, let us go up to the 
ISA.2.3	to the temple of the God of Jacob,
ISA.2.3	so
ISA.2.3	and
ISA.2.3	For Zion will be the center for moral instruction;
ISA.2.3	the 
ISA.2.4	 He will judge disputes between nations;
ISA.2.4	he will settle cases for many peoples.
ISA.2.4	They will beat their swords into plowshares,
ISA.2.4	and their spears into pruning hooks.
ISA.2.4	Nations will not take up the sword against other nations,
ISA.2.4	and they will no longer train for war.
ISA.2.5	 O descendants
ISA.2.5	come, let us walk in the 
ISA.2.6	 Indeed, O 
ISA.2.6	the descendants of Jacob.
ISA.2.6	For diviners from the east are everywhere;
ISA.2.6	they consult omen readers like the Philistines do.
ISA.2.6	Plenty of foreigners are around.
ISA.2.7	 Their land is full of gold and silver;
ISA.2.7	there is no end to their wealth.
ISA.2.7	Their land is full of horses;
ISA.2.7	there is no end to their chariots.
ISA.2.8	 Their land is full of worthless idols;
ISA.2.8	they worship
ISA.2.8	what their own fingers have fashioned.
ISA.2.9	 Men bow down to them in homage,
ISA.2.9	they lie flat on the ground in worship.
ISA.2.9	Don’t spare them!
ISA.2.10	 Go up into the rocky cliffs,
ISA.2.10	hide in the ground.
ISA.2.10	Get away from the dreadful judgment of the 
ISA.2.10	from his royal splendor!
ISA.2.11	 Proud men will be brought low,
ISA.2.11	arrogant men will be humiliated;
ISA.2.11	the 
ISA.2.11	in that day.
ISA.2.12	 Indeed, the 
ISA.2.12	for
ISA.2.12	for all who are proud – they will be humiliated;
ISA.2.13	 for all the cedars of Lebanon,
ISA.2.13	that are so high and mighty,
ISA.2.13	for all the oaks of Bashan;
ISA.2.14	 for all the tall mountains,
ISA.2.14	for all the high hills,
ISA.2.15	 for every high tower,
ISA.2.15	for every fortified wall,
ISA.2.16	 for all the large ships,
ISA.2.16	for all the impressive
ISA.2.17	 Proud men will be humiliated,
ISA.2.17	arrogant men will be brought low;
ISA.2.17	the 
ISA.2.17	in that day.
ISA.2.18	 The worthless idols will be completely eliminated.
ISA.2.19	 They
ISA.2.19	and into holes in the ground,
ISA.2.19	trying to escape the dreadful judgment of the 
ISA.2.19	and his royal splendor,
ISA.2.19	when he rises up to terrify the earth.
ISA.2.20	 At that time
ISA.2.20	their silver and gold idols,
ISA.2.20	which they made for themselves to worship,
ISA.2.20	into the caves where rodents and bats live,
ISA.2.21	 so they themselves can go into the crevices of the rocky cliffs
ISA.2.21	and the openings under the rocky overhangs,
ISA.2.21	trying to escape the dreadful judgment of the 
ISA.2.21	and his royal splendor,
ISA.2.21	when he rises up to terrify the earth.
ISA.2.22	 Stop trusting in human beings,
ISA.2.22	whose life’s breath is in their nostrils.
ISA.2.22	For why should they be given special consideration?
ISA.3.1	 Look, the sovereign 
ISA.3.1	is about to remove from Jerusalem
ISA.3.1	every source of security, including
ISA.3.1	all the food and water,
ISA.3.2	 the mighty men and warriors,
ISA.3.2	judges and prophets,
ISA.3.2	omen readers and leaders,
ISA.3.3	 captains of groups of fifty,
ISA.3.3	the respected citizens,
ISA.3.3	advisers and those skilled in magical arts,
ISA.3.3	and those who know incantations.
ISA.3.4	 The 
ISA.3.4	malicious young men
ISA.3.5	 The people will treat each other harshly;
ISA.3.5	men will oppose each other;
ISA.3.5	neighbors will fight.
ISA.3.5	Youths will proudly defy the elderly
ISA.3.5	and riffraff will challenge those who were once respected.
ISA.3.6	 Indeed, a man will grab his brother
ISA.3.6	right in his father’s house
ISA.3.6	‘You own a coat – 
ISA.3.6	you be our leader!
ISA.3.6	This heap of ruins will be under your control.’
ISA.3.7	 At that time
ISA.3.7	‘I am no doctor,
ISA.3.7	I have no food or coat in my house;
ISA.3.7	don’t make me a leader of the people!’”
ISA.3.8	 Jerusalem certainly stumbles,
ISA.3.8	Judah falls,
ISA.3.8	for their words and their actions offend the 
ISA.3.8	they rebel against his royal authority.
ISA.3.9	 The look on their faces
ISA.3.9	like the people of Sodom they openly boast of their sin.
ISA.3.9	Too bad for them!
ISA.3.9	For they bring disaster on themselves.
ISA.3.10	 Tell the innocent
ISA.3.10	for they will be rewarded for what they have done.
ISA.3.11	 Too bad for the wicked sinners!
ISA.3.11	For they will get exactly what they deserve.
ISA.3.12	 Oppressors treat my
ISA.3.12	creditors rule over them.
ISA.3.12	My people’s leaders mislead them;
ISA.3.12	they give you confusing directions.
ISA.3.13	 The 
ISA.3.13	he stands up to pass sentence on his people.
ISA.3.14	 The 
ISA.3.14	on the leaders of his people and their officials.
ISA.3.14	He says,
ISA.3.14	You have stashed in your houses what you have stolen from the poor.
ISA.3.15	 Why do you crush my people
ISA.3.15	 and grind the faces of the poor?”
ISA.3.15	The sovereign 
ISA.3.16	 The 
ISA.3.16	“The women
ISA.3.16	They walk with their heads high
ISA.3.16	and flirt with their eyes.
ISA.3.16	They skip along
ISA.3.16	and the jewelry on their ankles jingles.
ISA.3.17	 So
ISA.3.17	the 
ISA.3.18	 At that time
ISA.3.19	 earrings, bracelets, veils, 
ISA.3.20	 headdresses, ankle ornaments, sashes, sachets,
ISA.3.21	 rings, nose rings, 
ISA.3.22	 festive dresses, robes, shawls, purses, 
ISA.3.23	 garments, vests, head coverings, and gowns.
ISA.3.24	 A putrid stench will replace the smell of spices,
ISA.3.24	a rope will replace a belt,
ISA.3.24	baldness will replace braided locks of hair,
ISA.3.24	a sackcloth garment will replace a fine robe,
ISA.3.24	and a prisoner’s brand will replace beauty.
ISA.3.25	 Your
ISA.3.25	your strong men will die in battle.
ISA.3.26	 Her gates will mourn and lament;
ISA.3.26	deprived of her people, she will sit on the ground.
ISA.4.1	 Seven women will grab hold of
ISA.4.1	one man at that time.
ISA.4.1	They will say, “We will provide
ISA.4.1	we will provide
ISA.4.1	but let us belong to you
ISA.4.1	take away our shame!”
ISA.4.2	 At that time
ISA.4.2	the crops given by the 
ISA.4.2	the produce of the land will be a source of pride and delight 
ISA.4.2	to those who remain in Israel.
ISA.4.3	 Those remaining in Zion,
ISA.4.3	will be called “holy,”
ISA.4.3	all in Jerusalem who are destined to live.
ISA.4.4	 At that time
ISA.4.4	he will rinse the bloodstains from Jerusalem’s midst,
ISA.4.4	as he comes to judge
ISA.4.4	and to bring devastation.
ISA.4.5	 Then the 
ISA.4.5	over all of Mount Zion
ISA.4.5	and over its convocations
ISA.4.5	a cloud and smoke by day
ISA.4.5	and a bright flame of fire by night;
ISA.4.5	indeed a canopy will accompany the 
ISA.4.6	 By day it will be a shelter to provide shade from the heat,
ISA.4.6	as well as safety and protection from the heavy downpour.
ISA.5.1	 I
ISA.5.1	a song to my lover about his vineyard.
ISA.5.1	My love had a vineyard
ISA.5.1	on a fertile hill.
ISA.5.2	 He built a hedge around it,
ISA.5.2	and planted a vine.
ISA.5.2	He built a tower in the middle of it,
ISA.5.2	and constructed a winepress.
ISA.5.2	He waited for it to produce edible grapes,
ISA.5.2	but it produced sour ones instead.
ISA.5.3	 So now, residents of Jerusalem,
ISA.5.3	people
ISA.5.3	you decide between me and my vineyard!
ISA.5.4	 What more can I do for my vineyard
ISA.5.4	beyond what I have already done?
ISA.5.4	When I waited for it to produce edible grapes,
ISA.5.4	why did it produce sour ones instead?
ISA.5.5	 Now I will inform you
ISA.5.5	what I am about to do to my vineyard:
ISA.5.5	I will remove its hedge and turn it into pasture,
ISA.5.5	I will break its wall and allow animals to graze there.
ISA.5.6	 I will make it a wasteland;
ISA.5.6	no one will prune its vines or hoe its ground,
ISA.5.6	and thorns and briers will grow there.
ISA.5.6	I will order the clouds
ISA.5.6	not to drop any rain on it.
ISA.5.7	 Indeed
ISA.5.7	the people
ISA.5.7	He waited for justice, but look what he got – disobedience!
ISA.5.7	He waited for fairness, but look what he got – cries for help!
ISA.5.8	 Those who accumulate houses are as good as dead,
ISA.5.8	those who also accumulate landed property
ISA.5.8	until there is no land left,
ISA.5.8	and you are the only landowners remaining within the land.
ISA.5.9	 The 
ISA.5.9	“Many houses will certainly become desolate,
ISA.5.9	large, impressive houses will have no one living in them.
ISA.5.10	 Indeed, a large vineyard
ISA.5.10	and enough seed to yield several bushels
ISA.5.11	 Those who get up early to drink beer are as good as dead,
ISA.5.11	those who keep drinking long after dark
ISA.5.11	until they are intoxicated with wine.
ISA.5.12	 They have stringed instruments,
ISA.5.12	and wine at their parties.
ISA.5.12	So they do not recognize what the 
ISA.5.12	they do not perceive what he is bringing about.
ISA.5.13	 Therefore my
ISA.5.13	because of their lack of understanding.
ISA.5.13	Their
ISA.5.13	their
ISA.5.14	 So Death
ISA.5.14	and open wide its mouth;
ISA.5.14	Zion’s dignitaries and masses will descend into it,
ISA.5.14	including those who revel and celebrate within her.
ISA.5.15	 Men will be humiliated,
ISA.5.15	they will be brought low;
ISA.5.15	the proud will be brought low.
ISA.5.16	 The 
ISA.5.16	the sovereign God’s authority will be recognized when he judges.
ISA.5.17	 Lambs
ISA.5.17	amid the ruins the rich sojourners will graze.
ISA.5.18	 Those who pull evil along using cords of emptiness are as good as dead,
ISA.5.18	who pull sin as with cart ropes.
ISA.5.19	 They say, “Let him hurry, let him act quickly,
ISA.5.19	so we can see;
ISA.5.19	let the plan of the Holy One of Israel
ISA.5.19	then we will know it!”
ISA.5.20	 Those who call evil good and good evil are as good as dead,
ISA.5.20	who turn darkness into light and light into darkness,
ISA.5.20	who turn bitter into sweet and sweet into bitter.
ISA.5.21	 Those who think they are wise are as good as dead,
ISA.5.21	those who think they possess understanding.
ISA.5.22	 Those who are champions
ISA.5.22	who display great courage when mixing strong drinks.
ISA.5.23	 They pronounce the guilty innocent for a payoff,
ISA.5.23	they ignore the just cause of the innocent.
ISA.5.24	 Therefore, as flaming fire
ISA.5.24	and dry grass disintegrates in the flames,
ISA.5.24	so their root will rot,
ISA.5.24	and their flower will blow away like dust.
ISA.5.24	For they have rejected the law of the 
ISA.5.24	they have spurned the commands
ISA.5.25	 So the 
ISA.5.25	he lifts
ISA.5.25	The mountains shake,
ISA.5.25	and corpses lie like manure
ISA.5.25	Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
ISA.5.25	and his hand is ready to strike again.
ISA.5.26	 He lifts a signal flag for a distant nation,
ISA.5.26	he whistles for it to come from the far regions of the earth.
ISA.5.26	Look, they
ISA.5.27	 None tire or stumble,
ISA.5.27	they don’t stop to nap or sleep.
ISA.5.27	They don’t loosen their belts,
ISA.5.27	or unstrap their sandals to rest.
ISA.5.28	 Their arrows are sharpened,
ISA.5.28	and all their bows are prepared.
ISA.5.28	The hooves of their horses are hard as flint,
ISA.5.28	and their chariot wheels are like a windstorm.
ISA.5.29	 Their roar is like a lion’s;
ISA.5.29	they roar like young lions.
ISA.5.29	They growl and seize their prey;
ISA.5.29	they drag it away and no one can come to the rescue.
ISA.5.30	 At that time
ISA.5.30	it will sound like sea waves crashing against rocks.
ISA.5.30	One will look out over the land and see the darkness of disaster,
ISA.5.30	clouds will turn the light into darkness.
ISA.6.1	 In the year of King Uzziah’s death,
ISA.6.2	 Seraphs
ISA.6.3	 They called out to one another, “Holy, holy, holy
ISA.6.4	 The sound of their voices shook the door frames,
ISA.6.5	 I said, “Too bad for me! I am destroyed,
ISA.6.6	 But then one of the seraphs flew toward me. In his hand was a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs. 
ISA.6.7	 He touched my mouth with it and said, “Look, this coal has touched your lips. Your evil is removed; your sin is forgiven.”
ISA.6.8	 I heard the voice of the sovereign master say, “Whom will I send? Who will go on our behalf?”
ISA.6.9	 He said, “Go and tell these people:
ISA.6.9	‘Listen continually, but don’t understand!
ISA.6.9	Look continually, but don’t perceive!’
ISA.6.10	 Make the hearts of these people calloused;
ISA.6.10	make their ears deaf and their eyes blind!
ISA.6.10	Otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears,
ISA.6.10	their hearts might understand and they might repent and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	 I replied, “How long, sovereign master?” He said, 
ISA.6.11	“Until cities are in ruins and unpopulated,
ISA.6.11	and houses are uninhabited, 
ISA.6.11	and the land is ruined and devastated,
ISA.6.12	 and the 
ISA.6.12	and the very heart of the land is completely abandoned.
ISA.6.13	 Even if only a tenth of the people remain in the land, it will again be destroyed,
ISA.7.1	 During
ISA.7.2	 It was reported to the family
ISA.7.3	 So the 
ISA.7.4	 Tell him, ‘Make sure you stay calm!
ISA.7.5	 Syria has plotted with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah to bring about your demise.
ISA.7.6	 They say, “Let’s attack Judah, terrorize it, and conquer it.
ISA.7.7	 For this reason the sovereign master,
ISA.7.7	“It will not take place;
ISA.7.7	it will not happen.
ISA.7.8	 For Syria’s leader is Damascus, 
ISA.7.8	and the leader of Damascus is Rezin.
ISA.7.8	Within sixty-five years Ephraim will no longer exist as a nation.
ISA.7.9	 Ephraim’s leader is Samaria, 
ISA.7.9	and Samaria’s leader is the son of Remaliah.
ISA.7.9	If your faith does not remain firm, 
ISA.7.9	then you will not remain secure.”
ISA.7.10	 The 
ISA.7.11	 “Ask for a confirming sign from the 
ISA.7.12	 But Ahaz responded, “I don’t want to ask; I don’t want to put the 
ISA.7.13	 So Isaiah replied,
ISA.7.14	 For this reason the sovereign master himself will give you a confirming sign.
ISA.7.15	 He will eat sour milk
ISA.7.16	 Here is why this will be so:
ISA.7.17	 The 
ISA.7.18	 At that time
ISA.7.19	 All of them will come and make their home
ISA.7.20	 At that time
ISA.7.21	 At that time
ISA.7.22	 From the abundance of milk they produce,
ISA.7.23	 At that time
ISA.7.24	 With bow and arrow
ISA.7.25	 They will stay away from all the hills that were cultivated, for fear of the thorns and briers.
ISA.8.1	 The 
ISA.8.2	 Then I will summon
ISA.8.3	 I then had sexual relations with the prophetess; she conceived and gave birth to a son. The 
ISA.8.4	 for before the child knows how to cry out, ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria
ISA.8.5	 The 
ISA.8.6	 “These people
ISA.8.7	 So look, the sovereign master
ISA.8.8	 It will spill into Judah, flooding and engulfing, as it reaches to the necks of its victims. He will spread his wings out over your entire land,
ISA.8.9	 You will be broken,
ISA.8.9	you will be shattered!
ISA.8.9	Pay attention, all you distant lands of the earth!
ISA.8.9	Get ready for battle, and you will be shattered!
ISA.8.9	Get ready for battle, and you will be shattered!
ISA.8.10	 Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted! 
ISA.8.10	Issue your orders, but they will not be executed!
ISA.8.10	For God is with us!
ISA.8.11	 Indeed this is what the 
ISA.8.12	 “Do not say, ‘Conspiracy,’ every time these people say the word.
ISA.8.12	Don’t be afraid of what scares them; don’t be terrified.
ISA.8.13	 You must recognize the authority of the 
ISA.8.13	He is the one you must respect; 
ISA.8.13	he is the one you must fear.
ISA.8.14	 He will become a sanctuary,
ISA.8.14	but a stone that makes a person trip, 
ISA.8.14	and a rock that makes one stumble – 
ISA.8.14	to the two houses of Israel.
ISA.8.14	He will become
ISA.8.14	to the residents of Jerusalem.
ISA.8.15	 Many will stumble over the stone and the rock,
ISA.8.15	and will fall and be seriously injured,
ISA.8.15	and will be ensnared and captured.”
ISA.8.16	 Tie up the scroll as legal evidence,
ISA.8.16	seal the official record of God’s instructions and give it to my followers.
ISA.8.17	 I will wait patiently for the 
ISA.8.17	who has rejected the family of Jacob;
ISA.8.17	I will wait for him.
ISA.8.18	 Look, I and the sons whom the 
ISA.8.19	 They will say to you, “Seek oracles at the pits used to conjure up underworld spirits, from the magicians who chirp and mutter incantations.
ISA.8.20	 Then you must recall the 
ISA.8.21	 They will pass through the land
ISA.8.22	 When one looks out over the land, he sees
ISA.9.1	In earlier times he
ISA.9.1	the land of Zebulun,
ISA.9.1	and the land of Naphtali;
ISA.9.1	but now he brings honor
ISA.9.1	to the way of the sea,
ISA.9.1	the region beyond the Jordan,
ISA.9.1	and Galilee of the nations.
ISA.9.2	see a bright light;
ISA.9.2	light shines 
ISA.9.2	on those who live in a land of deep darkness.
ISA.9.3	 You
ISA.9.3	you give them great joy.
ISA.9.3	They rejoice in your presence
ISA.9.3	as harvesters rejoice;
ISA.9.3	as warriors celebrate
ISA.9.4	 For their oppressive yoke
ISA.9.4	and the club that strikes their shoulders,
ISA.9.4	the cudgel the oppressor uses on them,
ISA.9.4	you have shattered, as in the day of Midian’s defeat.
ISA.9.5	 Indeed every boot that marches and shakes the earth
ISA.9.5	and every garment dragged through blood
ISA.9.5	is used as fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.6	 For a child has been
ISA.9.6	a son has been given to us.
ISA.9.6	He shoulders responsibility
ISA.9.6	and is called:
ISA.9.6	Extraordinary Strategist,
ISA.9.6	Mighty God,
ISA.9.6	Everlasting Father,
ISA.9.6	Prince of Peace.
ISA.9.7	 His dominion will be vast
ISA.9.7	and he will bring immeasurable prosperity.
ISA.9.7	He will rule on David’s throne
ISA.9.7	and over David’s kingdom,
ISA.9.7	establishing it
ISA.9.7	by promoting justice and fairness,
ISA.9.7	from this time forward and forevermore.
ISA.9.7	The 
ISA.9.8	 The sovereign master
ISA.9.8	and it fell on Israel.
ISA.9.9	 All the people were aware
ISA.9.9	the people of Ephraim and those living in Samaria.
ISA.9.9	Yet with pride and an arrogant attitude, they said,
ISA.9.10	 “The bricks have fallen, 
ISA.9.10	but we will rebuild with chiseled stone;
ISA.9.10	the sycamore fig trees have been cut down,
ISA.9.10	but we will replace them with cedars.”
ISA.9.11	 Then the 
ISA.9.11	 he stirred up
ISA.9.12	 Syria from the east,
ISA.9.12	and the Philistines from the west,
ISA.9.12	they gobbled up Israelite territory.
ISA.9.12	Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
ISA.9.12	and his hand is ready to strike again.
ISA.9.13	 The people did not return to the one who struck them,
ISA.9.13	they did not seek reconciliation
ISA.9.14	 So the 
ISA.9.14	both the shoots and stalk
ISA.9.15	 The leaders and the highly respected people
ISA.9.15	the prophets who teach lies are the tail.
ISA.9.16	 The leaders of this nation were misleading people,
ISA.9.16	and the people being led were destroyed.
ISA.9.17	 So the sovereign master was not pleased
ISA.9.17	he took no pity
ISA.9.17	for the whole nation was godless
ISA.9.17	every mouth was speaking disgraceful words.
ISA.9.17	Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
ISA.9.17	and his hand is ready to strike again.
ISA.9.18	 For
ISA.9.18	it consumed thorns and briers;
ISA.9.18	it burned up the thickets of the forest,
ISA.9.18	and they went up in smoke.
ISA.9.19	 Because of the anger of the 
ISA.9.19	and the people became fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.19	People had no compassion on one another.
ISA.9.20	 They devoured
ISA.9.20	they ate on the left, but were not satisfied.
ISA.9.20	People even ate
ISA.9.21	 Manasseh fought against
ISA.9.21	and Ephraim against Manasseh;
ISA.9.21	together they fought against Judah. 
ISA.9.21	Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
ISA.9.21	and his hand is ready to strike again.
ISA.10.1	 Those who enact unjust policies are as good as dead,
ISA.10.1	those who are always instituting unfair regulations,
ISA.10.2	 to keep the poor from getting fair treatment,
ISA.10.2	and to deprive
ISA.10.2	so they can steal what widows own,
ISA.10.2	and loot what belongs to orphans.
ISA.10.3	 What will you do on judgment day,
ISA.10.3	when destruction arrives from a distant place?
ISA.10.3	To whom will you run for help?
ISA.10.3	Where will you leave your wealth?
ISA.10.4	 You will have no place to go, except to kneel with the prisoners,
ISA.10.4	or to fall among those who have been killed.
ISA.10.4	Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
ISA.10.4	and his hand is ready to strike again.
ISA.10.5	 Assyria, the club I use to vent my anger, is as good as dead,
ISA.10.5	a cudgel with which I angrily punish.
ISA.10.6	 I sent him
ISA.10.6	I ordered him to attack the people with whom I was angry,
ISA.10.6	to take plunder and to carry away loot,
ISA.10.6	to trample them down
ISA.10.7	 But he does not agree with this,
ISA.10.7	his mind does not reason this way,
ISA.10.7	for his goal is to destroy,
ISA.10.7	and to eliminate many nations.
ISA.10.8	 Indeed,
ISA.10.8	“Are not my officials all kings?
ISA.10.9	 Is not Calneh like Carchemish?
ISA.10.9	Hamath like Arpad?
ISA.10.9	Samaria like Damascus?
ISA.10.10	 I overpowered kingdoms ruled by idols,
ISA.10.10	whose carved images were more impressive than Jerusalem’s
ISA.10.11	 As I have done to Samaria and its idols,
ISA.10.11	so I will do to Jerusalem and its idols.”
ISA.10.12	 But when
ISA.10.13	 For he says:
ISA.10.13	“By my strong hand I have accomplished this,
ISA.10.13	by my strategy that I devised.
ISA.10.13	I invaded the territory of nations,
ISA.10.13	and looted their storehouses.
ISA.10.13	Like a mighty conqueror,
ISA.10.14	 My hand discovered the wealth of the nations, as if it were in a nest,
ISA.10.14	as one gathers up abandoned eggs,
ISA.10.14	I gathered up the whole earth.
ISA.10.14	There was no wing flapping,
ISA.10.14	or open mouth chirping.”
ISA.10.15	 Does an ax exalt itself over the one who wields it,
ISA.10.15	or a saw magnify itself over the one who cuts with it?
ISA.10.15	As if a scepter should brandish the one who raises it,
ISA.10.15	or a staff should lift up what is not made of wood!
ISA.10.16	 For this reason
ISA.10.17	 The light of Israel
ISA.10.17	their Holy One
ISA.10.17	it will burn and consume the Assyrian king’s
ISA.10.17	and his thorns in one day.
ISA.10.18	 The splendor of his forest and his orchard
ISA.10.18	will be completely destroyed,
ISA.10.18	as when a sick man’s life ebbs away.
ISA.10.19	 There will be so few trees left in his forest,
ISA.10.19	a child will be able to count them.
ISA.10.20	 At that time
ISA.10.21	 A remnant will come back, a remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
ISA.10.22	 For though your people, Israel, are as numerous as
ISA.10.23	 The sovereign master, the 
ISA.10.24	 So
ISA.10.25	 For very soon my fury
ISA.10.26	 The 
ISA.10.27	 At that time
ISA.10.27	the 
ISA.10.27	and their yoke from your neck;
ISA.10.27	the yoke will be taken off because your neck will be too large.
ISA.10.28	 They
ISA.10.28	moved through Migron,
ISA.10.28	depositing their supplies at Micmash.
ISA.10.29	 They went through the pass,
ISA.10.29	spent the night at Geba.
ISA.10.29	Ramah trembled,
ISA.10.29	Gibeah of Saul ran away.
ISA.10.30	 Shout out, daughter of Gallim!
ISA.10.30	Pay attention, Laishah!
ISA.10.30	Answer her, Anathoth!
ISA.10.31	 Madmenah flees,
ISA.10.31	the residents of Gebim have hidden.
ISA.10.32	 This very day, standing in Nob,
ISA.10.32	they shake their fist at Daughter Zion’s mountain
ISA.10.32	at the hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	 Look, the sovereign master, the 
ISA.10.33	is ready to cut off the branches with terrifying power.
ISA.10.33	The tallest trees
ISA.10.33	the loftiest ones will be brought low.
ISA.10.34	 The thickets of the forest will be chopped down with an ax,
ISA.10.34	and mighty Lebanon will fall.
ISA.11.1	 A shoot will grow out of Jesse’s
ISA.11.1	a bud will sprout
ISA.11.2	 The 
ISA.11.2	a spirit that gives extraordinary wisdom,
ISA.11.2	a spirit that provides the ability to execute plans,
ISA.11.2	a spirit that produces absolute loyalty to the 
ISA.11.3	 He will take delight in obeying the 
ISA.11.3	He will not judge by mere appearances,
ISA.11.3	or make decisions on the basis of hearsay.
ISA.11.4	 He will treat the poor fairly,
ISA.11.4	and make right decisions
ISA.11.4	He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth,
ISA.11.4	and order the wicked to be executed.
ISA.11.5	 Justice will be like a belt around his waist,
ISA.11.5	integrity will be like a belt around his hips.
ISA.11.6	 A wolf will reside
ISA.11.6	and a leopard will lie down with a young goat;
ISA.11.6	an ox and a young lion will graze together,
ISA.11.6	as a small child leads them along.
ISA.11.7	 A cow and a bear will graze together,
ISA.11.7	their young will lie down together.
ISA.11.7	A lion, like an ox, will eat straw.
ISA.11.8	 A baby
ISA.11.8	over the hole of a snake;
ISA.11.8	over the nest
ISA.11.8	an infant
ISA.11.9	 They will no longer injure or destroy
ISA.11.9	on my entire royal mountain.
ISA.11.9	For there will be universal submission to the 
ISA.11.9	just as the waters completely cover the sea.
ISA.11.10	 At that time
ISA.11.11	 At that time
ISA.11.12	 He will lift a signal flag for the nations;
ISA.11.12	he will gather Israel’s dispersed people
ISA.11.12	and assemble Judah’s scattered people
ISA.11.12	from the four corners of the earth.
ISA.11.13	 Ephraim’s jealousy will end,
ISA.11.13	and Judah’s hostility
ISA.11.13	Ephraim will no longer be jealous of Judah,
ISA.11.13	and Judah will no longer be hostile toward Ephraim.
ISA.11.14	 They will swoop down
ISA.11.14	together they will loot the people of the east.
ISA.11.14	They will take over Edom and Moab,
ISA.11.14	and the Ammonites will be their subjects.
ISA.11.15	 The 
ISA.11.15	he will wave his hand over the Euphrates River
ISA.11.15	he will turn it into seven dried-up streams,
ISA.11.15	and enable them to walk across in their sandals.
ISA.11.16	 There will be a highway leading out of Assyria
ISA.11.16	for the remnant of his people,
ISA.11.16	just as there was for Israel,
ISA.11.16	when
ISA.12.1	 At that time
ISA.12.1	“I praise you, O 
ISA.12.1	for even though you were angry with me,
ISA.12.1	your anger subsided, and you consoled me.
ISA.12.2	 Look, God is my deliverer!
ISA.12.2	I will trust in him
ISA.12.2	For the 
ISA.12.2	he has become my deliverer.”
ISA.12.3	 Joyfully you will draw water
ISA.12.3	from the springs of deliverance.
ISA.12.4	 At that time
ISA.12.4	“Praise the 
ISA.12.4	Ask him for help!
ISA.12.4	Publicize his mighty acts among the nations!
ISA.12.4	Make it known that he is unique!
ISA.12.5	 Sing to the 
ISA.12.5	let this be known
ISA.12.6	 Cry out and shout for joy, O citizens of Zion,
ISA.12.6	for the Holy One of Israel
ISA.13.1	 This is a message about Babylon that God revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz:
ISA.13.2	 On a bare hill raise a signal flag,
ISA.13.2	shout to them,
ISA.13.2	wave your hand,
ISA.13.2	so they might enter the gates of the princes!
ISA.13.3	 I have given orders to my chosen soldiers;
ISA.13.3	I have summoned the warriors through whom I will vent my anger,
ISA.13.3	my boasting, arrogant ones.
ISA.13.4	 There is a loud noise on the mountains – 
ISA.13.4	it sounds like a large army!
ISA.13.4	There is great commotion among the kingdoms
ISA.13.4	nations are being assembled!
ISA.13.4	The 
ISA.13.4	forces for battle.
ISA.13.5	 They come from a distant land,
ISA.13.5	from the horizon.
ISA.13.5	It is the 
ISA.13.5	coming to destroy the whole earth.
ISA.13.6	 Wail, for the 
ISA.13.6	it comes with all the destructive power of the sovereign judge.
ISA.13.7	 For this reason all hands hang limp,
ISA.13.7	every human heart loses its courage.
ISA.13.8	 They panic – 
ISA.13.8	cramps and pain seize hold of them
ISA.13.8	like those of a woman who is straining to give birth.
ISA.13.8	They look at one another in astonishment;
ISA.13.8	their faces are flushed red.
ISA.13.9	 Look, the 
ISA.13.9	it is a day of cruelty and savage, raging anger,
ISA.13.9	destroying
ISA.13.9	and annihilating its sinners.
ISA.13.10	 Indeed the stars in the sky and their constellations
ISA.13.10	no longer give out their light;
ISA.13.10	the sun is darkened as soon as it rises,
ISA.13.10	and the moon does not shine.
ISA.13.11	 I will punish the world for its evil,
ISA.13.11	and wicked people for their sin.
ISA.13.11	I will put an end to the pride of the insolent,
ISA.13.11	I will bring down the arrogance of tyrants.
ISA.13.12	 I will make human beings more scarce than pure gold,
ISA.13.12	and people more scarce
ISA.13.13	 So I will shake the heavens,
ISA.13.13	and the earth will shake loose from its foundation,
ISA.13.13	because of the fury of the 
ISA.13.13	in the day he vents his raging anger.
ISA.13.14	 Like a frightened gazelle
ISA.13.14	or a sheep with no shepherd,
ISA.13.14	each will turn toward home,
ISA.13.14	each will run to his homeland. 
ISA.13.15	 Everyone who is caught will be stabbed;
ISA.13.15	everyone who is seized
ISA.13.16	 Their children will be smashed to pieces before their very eyes;
ISA.13.16	their houses will be looted
ISA.13.16	and their wives raped.
ISA.13.17	 Look, I am stirring up the Medes to attack them;
ISA.13.17	they are not concerned about silver,
ISA.13.17	nor are they interested in gold.
ISA.13.18	 Their arrows will cut young men to ribbons;
ISA.13.18	they have no compassion on a person’s offspring,
ISA.13.18	they will not
ISA.13.19	 Babylon, the most admired
ISA.13.19	the Chaldeans’ source of honor and pride,
ISA.13.19	will be destroyed by God
ISA.13.19	just as Sodom and Gomorrah were.
ISA.13.20	 No one will live there again;
ISA.13.20	no one will ever reside there again.
ISA.13.20	No bedouin
ISA.13.20	no shepherds will rest their flocks
ISA.13.21	 Wild animals will rest there,
ISA.13.21	the ruined
ISA.13.21	Ostriches will live there,
ISA.13.21	wild goats will skip among the ruins.
ISA.13.22	 Wild dogs will yip in her ruined fortresses,
ISA.13.22	jackals will yelp in the once-splendid palaces.
ISA.13.22	Her time is almost up,
ISA.13.22	her days will not be prolonged.
ISA.14.1	 The 
ISA.14.2	 Nations will take them and bring them back to their own place. Then the family of Jacob will make foreigners their servants as they settle in the 
ISA.14.3	 When the 
ISA.14.4	 you will taunt the king of Babylon with these words:
ISA.14.4	“Look how the oppressor has met his end!
ISA.14.4	Hostility
ISA.14.5	 The 
ISA.14.5	the scepter of rulers.
ISA.14.6	 It
ISA.14.6	with unceasing blows.
ISA.14.6	It angrily ruled over nations,
ISA.14.6	oppressing them without restraint.
ISA.14.7	 The whole earth rests and is quiet;
ISA.14.7	they break into song.
ISA.14.8	 The evergreens also rejoice over your demise,
ISA.14.8	as do the cedars of Lebanon, singing,
ISA.14.8	‘Since you fell asleep,
ISA.14.8	no woodsman comes up to chop us down!’
ISA.14.9	 Sheol
ISA.14.9	ready to meet you when you arrive.
ISA.14.9	It rouses
ISA.14.9	all the former leaders of the earth;
ISA.14.9	it makes all the former kings of the nations
ISA.14.9	rise from their thrones.
ISA.14.10	 All of them respond to you, saying:
ISA.14.10	‘You too have become weak like us!
ISA.14.10	You have become just like us!
ISA.14.11	 Your splendor
ISA.14.11	as well as the sound of your stringed instruments.
ISA.14.11	You lie on a bed of maggots,
ISA.14.11	with a blanket of worms over you.
ISA.14.12	 Look how you have fallen from the sky,
ISA.14.12	O shining one, son of the dawn!
ISA.14.12	You have been cut down to the ground,
ISA.14.12	O conqueror
ISA.14.13	 You said to yourself,
ISA.14.13	“I will climb up to the sky.
ISA.14.13	Above the stars of El
ISA.14.13	I will set up my throne.
ISA.14.13	I will rule on the mountain of assembly
ISA.14.13	on the remote slopes of Zaphon.
ISA.14.14	 I will climb up to the tops
ISA.14.14	I will make myself like the Most High!”
ISA.14.15	 But you were brought down
ISA.14.15	to the remote slopes of the pit.
ISA.14.16	 Those who see you stare at you,
ISA.14.16	they look at you carefully, thinking:
ISA.14.16	“Is this the man who shook the earth,
ISA.14.16	the one who made kingdoms tremble?
ISA.14.17	 Is this the one who made the world like a desert,
ISA.14.17	who ruined its
ISA.14.17	and refused to free his prisoners so they could return home?”’
ISA.14.18	As for all the kings of the nations,
ISA.14.18	all of them
ISA.14.18	each in his own tomb.
ISA.14.19	 But you have been thrown out of your grave
ISA.14.19	like a shoot that is thrown away.
ISA.14.19	You lie among
ISA.14.19	among those who have been slashed by the sword,
ISA.14.19	among those headed for
ISA.14.19	as if you were a mangled corpse.
ISA.14.20	 You will not be buried with them,
ISA.14.20	because you destroyed your land
ISA.14.20	and killed your people.
ISA.14.20	The offspring of the wicked
ISA.14.20	will never be mentioned again.
ISA.14.21	 Prepare to execute
ISA.14.21	for the sins their ancestors have committed.
ISA.14.21	They must not rise up and take possession of the earth,
ISA.14.21	or fill the surface of the world with cities.”
ISA.14.22	 “I will rise up against them,”
ISA.14.22	says the 
ISA.14.22	“I will blot out all remembrance of Babylon and destroy all her people,
ISA.14.22	including the offspring she produces,”
ISA.14.22	says the 
ISA.14.23	 “I will turn her into a place that is overrun with wild animals
ISA.14.23	and covered with pools of stagnant water.
ISA.14.23	I will get rid of her, just as one sweeps away dirt with a broom,”
ISA.14.23	says the 
ISA.14.24	 The 
ISA.14.24	“Be sure of this:
ISA.14.24	Just as I have intended, so it will be;
ISA.14.24	just as I have planned, it will happen.
ISA.14.25	 I will break Assyria
ISA.14.25	I will trample them
ISA.14.25	Their yoke will be removed from my people,
ISA.14.25	the burden will be lifted from their shoulders.
ISA.14.26	 This is the plan I have devised for the whole earth;
ISA.14.26	my hand is ready to strike all the nations.”
ISA.14.27	 Indeed,
ISA.14.27	and who can possibly frustrate it?
ISA.14.27	His hand is ready to strike,
ISA.14.27	and who can possibly stop it?
ISA.14.28	 In the year King Ahaz died,
ISA.14.29	 Don’t be so happy, all you Philistines,
ISA.14.29	just because the club that beat you has been broken!
ISA.14.29	For a viper will grow out of the serpent’s root,
ISA.14.29	and its fruit will be a darting adder.
ISA.14.30	 The poor will graze in my pastures;
ISA.14.30	the needy will rest securely.
ISA.14.30	But I will kill your root by famine;
ISA.14.30	it will put to death all your survivors.
ISA.14.31	 Wail, O city gate!
ISA.14.31	Cry out, O city!
ISA.14.31	Melt with fear,
ISA.14.31	For out of the north comes a cloud of smoke,
ISA.14.31	and there are no stragglers in its ranks.
ISA.14.32	 How will they respond to the messengers of this nation?
ISA.14.32	Indeed, the 
ISA.14.32	the oppressed among his people will find safety in her.
ISA.15.1	 Here is a message about Moab:
ISA.15.1	Indeed, in a night it is devastated,
ISA.15.1	Ar of Moab is destroyed!
ISA.15.1	Indeed, in a night it is devastated,
ISA.15.1	Kir of Moab is destroyed!
ISA.15.2	 They went up to the temple,
ISA.15.2	the people of Dibon went up to the high places to lament.
ISA.15.2	Because of what happened to Nebo and Medeba,
ISA.15.2	Every head is shaved bare,
ISA.15.2	every beard is trimmed off.
ISA.15.3	 In their streets they wear sackcloth;
ISA.15.3	on their roofs and in their town squares
ISA.15.3	all of them wail,
ISA.15.3	they fall down weeping.
ISA.15.4	 The people of
ISA.15.4	their voices are heard as far away as Jahaz.
ISA.15.4	For this reason Moab’s soldiers shout in distress;
ISA.15.4	their courage wavers.
ISA.15.5	 My heart cries out because of Moab’s plight,
ISA.15.5	and for the fugitives
ISA.15.5	For they weep as they make their way up the ascent of Luhith;
ISA.15.5	they loudly lament their demise on the road to Horonaim.
ISA.15.6	 For the waters of Nimrim are gone;
ISA.15.6	the grass is dried up,
ISA.15.6	the vegetation has disappeared,
ISA.15.6	and there are no plants.
ISA.15.7	 For this reason what they have made and stored up,
ISA.15.7	they carry over the Stream of the Poplars.
ISA.15.8	 Indeed, the cries of distress echo throughout Moabite territory;
ISA.15.8	their wailing can be heard in Eglaim and Beer Elim.
ISA.15.9	 Indeed, the waters of Dimon
ISA.15.9	Indeed, I will heap even more trouble on Dimon.
ISA.15.9	A lion will attack
ISA.15.9	and the people left in the land.
ISA.16.1	 Send rams as tribute to the ruler of the land,
ISA.16.1	from Sela in the desert
ISA.16.1	to the hill of Daughter Zion.
ISA.16.2	 At the fords of the Arnon
ISA.16.2	the Moabite women are like a bird
ISA.16.2	that flies about when forced from its nest.
ISA.16.3	 “Bring a plan, make a decision!
ISA.16.3	Provide some shade in the middle of the day!
ISA.16.3	Hide the fugitives! Do not betray
ISA.16.4	 Please let the Moabite fugitives live
ISA.16.4	Hide them
ISA.16.4	Certainly
ISA.16.4	the destroyer will come to an end,
ISA.16.4	those who trample will disappear
ISA.16.5	 Then a trustworthy king will be established;
ISA.16.5	he will rule in a reliable manner,
ISA.16.5	this one from David’s family.
ISA.16.5	He will be sure to make just decisions
ISA.16.5	and will be experienced in executing justice.
ISA.16.6	 We have heard about Moab’s pride,
ISA.16.6	their great arrogance,
ISA.16.6	their boasting, pride, and excess.
ISA.16.6	But their boastful claims are empty!
ISA.16.7	 So Moab wails over its demise
ISA.16.7	they all wail!
ISA.16.7	Completely devastated, they moan
ISA.16.7	about what has happened to the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.
ISA.16.8	 For the fields of Heshbon are dried up,
ISA.16.8	as well as the vines of Sibmah.
ISA.16.8	The rulers of the nations trample all over its vines,
ISA.16.8	which reach Jazer and spread to the desert;
ISA.16.8	their shoots spread out and cross the sea.
ISA.16.9	 So I weep along with Jazer
ISA.16.9	over the vines of Sibmah.
ISA.16.9	I will saturate you
ISA.16.9	for the conquering invaders shout triumphantly
ISA.16.9	over your fruit and crops.
ISA.16.10	 Joy and happiness disappear from the orchards,
ISA.16.10	and in the vineyards no one rejoices or shouts;
ISA.16.10	no one treads out juice in the wine vats
ISA.16.10	I have brought the joyful shouts to an end.
ISA.16.11	 So my heart constantly sighs for Moab, like the strumming of a harp,
ISA.16.11	my inner being sighs
ISA.16.12	 When the Moabites plead with all their might at their high places,
ISA.16.12	and enter their temples to pray, their prayers will be ineffective!
ISA.16.13	 This is the message the 
ISA.16.14	 Now the 
ISA.17.1	 Here is a message about Damascus:
ISA.17.1	“Look, Damascus is no longer a city,
ISA.17.1	it is a heap of ruins!
ISA.17.2	 The cities of Aroer are abandoned.
ISA.17.2	They will be used for herds,
ISA.17.2	which will lie down there in peace.
ISA.17.3	 Fortified cities will disappear from Ephraim,
ISA.17.3	and Damascus will lose its kingdom.
ISA.17.3	The survivors in Syria
ISA.17.3	will end up like the splendor of the Israelites,”
ISA.17.3	says the 
ISA.17.4	 “At that time
ISA.17.4	Jacob’s splendor will be greatly diminished,
ISA.17.4	and he will become skin and bones.
ISA.17.5	 It will be as when one gathers the grain harvest, 
ISA.17.5	and his hand gleans the ear of grain.
ISA.17.5	It will be like one gathering the ears of grain
ISA.17.5	in the Valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.6	 There will be some left behind,
ISA.17.6	like when an olive tree is beaten – 
ISA.17.6	two or three ripe olives remain toward the very top,
ISA.17.6	four or five on its fruitful branches,”
ISA.17.6	says the 
ISA.17.7	 At that time
ISA.17.7	they will depend on
ISA.17.8	 They will no longer trust in
ISA.17.8	or depend on the Asherah poles and incense altars their fingers made.
ISA.17.9	 At that time
ISA.17.9	like the abandoned summits of the Amorites,
ISA.17.9	which they abandoned because of the Israelites;
ISA.17.9	there will be desolation.
ISA.17.10	 For you ignore
ISA.17.10	you pay no attention to your strong protector.
ISA.17.10	So this is what happens:
ISA.17.10	You cultivate beautiful plants
ISA.17.10	and plant exotic vines.
ISA.17.11	 The day you begin cultivating, you do what you can to make it grow;
ISA.17.11	the morning you begin planting, you do what you can to make it sprout.
ISA.17.11	Yet the harvest will disappear
ISA.17.11	and incurable pain.
ISA.17.12	 The many nations massing together are as good as dead,
ISA.17.12	those who make a commotion as loud as the roaring of the sea’s waves.
ISA.17.12	The people making such an uproar are as good as dead,
ISA.17.12	those who make an uproar as loud as the roaring of powerful waves.
ISA.17.13	 Though these people make an uproar as loud as the roaring of powerful waves,
ISA.17.13	when he shouts at
ISA.17.13	driven before the wind like dead weeds on the hills,
ISA.17.13	or like dead thistles
ISA.17.14	 In the evening there is sudden terror;
ISA.17.14	by morning they vanish.
ISA.17.14	This is the fate of those who try to plunder us,
ISA.17.14	the destiny of those who try to loot us!
ISA.18.1	 The land of buzzing wings is as good as dead,
ISA.18.1	the one beyond the rivers of Cush,
ISA.18.2	 that sends messengers by sea,
ISA.18.2	who glide over the water’s surface in boats made of papyrus.
ISA.18.2	Go, you swift messengers,
ISA.18.2	to a nation of tall, smooth-skinned people,
ISA.18.2	to a people that are feared far and wide,
ISA.18.2	to a nation strong and victorious,
ISA.18.2	whose land rivers divide.
ISA.18.3	 All you who live in the world,
ISA.18.3	who reside on the earth,
ISA.18.3	you will see a signal flag raised on the mountains;
ISA.18.3	you will hear a trumpet being blown.
ISA.18.4	 For this is what the 
ISA.18.4	“I will wait
ISA.18.4	like scorching heat produced by the sunlight,
ISA.18.4	like a cloud of mist
ISA.18.5	 For before the harvest, when the bud has sprouted,
ISA.18.5	and the ripening fruit appears,
ISA.18.5	he will cut off the unproductive shoots
ISA.18.5	he will prune the tendrils.
ISA.18.6	 They will all be left
ISA.18.6	and the wild animals;
ISA.18.6	the birds will eat them during the summer,
ISA.18.6	and all the wild animals will eat them during the winter.
ISA.18.7	 At that time
ISA.18.7	tribute will be brought to the 
ISA.18.7	by a people that are tall and smooth-skinned,
ISA.18.7	a people that are feared far and wide,
ISA.18.7	a nation strong and victorious,
ISA.18.7	whose land rivers divide.
ISA.18.7	The tribute
ISA.19.1	 Here is a message about Egypt:
ISA.19.1	Look, the 
ISA.19.1	and approaches Egypt.
ISA.19.1	The idols of Egypt tremble before him;
ISA.19.1	the Egyptians lose their courage.
ISA.19.2	 “I will provoke civil strife in Egypt,
ISA.19.2	brothers will fight with each other,
ISA.19.2	as will neighbors,
ISA.19.2	cities, and kingdoms.
ISA.19.3	 The Egyptians will panic,
ISA.19.3	and I will confuse their strategy.
ISA.19.3	They will seek guidance from the idols and from the spirits of the dead,
ISA.19.3	from the pits used to conjure up underworld spirits, and from the magicians.
ISA.19.4	 I will hand Egypt over to a harsh master;
ISA.19.4	a powerful king will rule over them,”
ISA.19.4	says the sovereign master,
ISA.19.5	 The water of the sea will be dried up,
ISA.19.5	and the river will dry up and be empty.
ISA.19.6	 The canals
ISA.19.6	the streams of Egypt will trickle and then dry up;
ISA.19.6	the bulrushes and reeds will decay,
ISA.19.7	 along with the plants by the mouth of the river.
ISA.19.7	All the cultivated land near the river
ISA.19.7	will turn to dust and be blown away.
ISA.19.8	 The fishermen will mourn and lament,
ISA.19.8	all those who cast a fishhook into the river,
ISA.19.8	and those who spread out a net on the water’s surface will grieve.
ISA.19.9	 Those who make clothes from combed flax will be embarrassed;
ISA.19.9	those who weave will turn pale.
ISA.19.10	 Those who make cloth
ISA.19.10	all the hired workers will be depressed.
ISA.19.11	 The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools;
ISA.19.11	Pharaoh’s wise advisers give stupid advice.
ISA.19.11	How dare you say to Pharaoh,
ISA.19.11	“I am one of the sages,
ISA.19.11	one well-versed in the writings of the ancient kings?”
ISA.19.12	 But where, oh where, are your wise men?
ISA.19.12	Let them tell you, let them find out
ISA.19.12	what the 
ISA.19.13	 The officials of Zoan are fools,
ISA.19.13	the officials of Memphis
ISA.19.13	the rulers
ISA.19.14	 The 
ISA.19.14	they lead Egypt astray in all she does,
ISA.19.14	so that she is like a drunk sliding around in his own vomit.
ISA.19.15	 Egypt will not be able to do a thing,
ISA.19.15	head or tail, shoots and stalk.
ISA.19.16	 At that time
ISA.19.17	 The land of Judah will humiliate Egypt. Everyone who hears about Judah will be afraid because of what the 
ISA.19.18	 At that time five cities
ISA.19.19	 At that time there will be an altar for the 
ISA.19.20	 It
ISA.19.21	 The 
ISA.19.22	 The 
ISA.19.23	 At that time there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will visit Egypt, and the Egyptians will visit Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.
ISA.19.24	 At that time Israel will be the third member of the group, along with Egypt and Assyria, and will be a recipient of blessing
ISA.19.25	 The 
ISA.20.1	 The 
ISA.20.2	 At that time the 
ISA.20.3	 Later the 
ISA.20.4	 so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, both young and old. They will be in undergarments and barefoot, with the buttocks exposed; the Egyptians will be publicly humiliated.
ISA.20.5	 Those who put their hope in Cush and took pride in Egypt will be afraid and embarrassed.
ISA.20.6	 At that time
ISA.21.1	 Here is a message about the Desert by the Sea:
ISA.21.1	Like strong winds blowing in the south,
ISA.21.1	one invades from the desert,
ISA.21.1	from a land that is feared.
ISA.21.2	 I have received a distressing message:
ISA.21.2	“The deceiver deceives,
ISA.21.2	the destroyer destroys.
ISA.21.2	Attack, you Elamites!
ISA.21.2	Lay siege, you Medes!
ISA.21.2	I will put an end to all the groaning!”
ISA.21.3	 For this reason my stomach churns;
ISA.21.3	cramps overwhelm me
ISA.21.3	like the contractions of a woman in labor.
ISA.21.3	I am disturbed
ISA.21.3	horrified by what I see.
ISA.21.4	 My heart palpitates,
ISA.21.4	I shake in fear;
ISA.21.4	the twilight I desired
ISA.21.4	has brought me terror.
ISA.21.5	 Arrange the table,
ISA.21.5	lay out
ISA.21.5	eat and drink!
ISA.21.5	Get up, you officers,
ISA.21.5	smear oil on the shields!
ISA.21.6	 For this is what the sovereign master
ISA.21.6	“Go, post a guard!
ISA.21.6	He must report what he sees.
ISA.21.7	 When he sees chariots, 
ISA.21.7	teams of horses,
ISA.21.7	riders on donkeys,
ISA.21.7	riders on camels,
ISA.21.7	he must be alert,
ISA.21.7	very alert.”
ISA.21.8	 Then the guard
ISA.21.8	“On the watchtower, O sovereign master,
ISA.21.8	I stand all day long;
ISA.21.8	at my post
ISA.21.8	I am stationed every night.
ISA.21.9	 Look what’s coming!
ISA.21.9	A charioteer,
ISA.21.9	a team of horses.”
ISA.21.9	When questioned, he replies,
ISA.21.9	“Babylon has fallen, fallen!
ISA.21.9	All the idols of her gods lie shattered on the ground!”
ISA.21.10	 O my downtrodden people, crushed like stalks on the threshing floor,
ISA.21.10	what I have heard 
ISA.21.10	from the 
ISA.21.10	the God of Israel,
ISA.21.10	I have reported to you.
ISA.21.11	 Here is a message about Dumah:
ISA.21.11	Someone calls to me from Seir,
ISA.21.11	“Watchman, what is left of the night?
ISA.21.11	Watchman, what is left of the night?”
ISA.21.12	 The watchman replies,
ISA.21.12	“Morning is coming, but then night.
ISA.21.12	If you want to ask, ask;
ISA.21.12	come back again.”
ISA.21.13	 Here is a message about Arabia:
ISA.21.13	In the thicket of Arabia you spend the night,
ISA.21.13	you Dedanite caravans.
ISA.21.14	 Bring out some water for the thirsty.
ISA.21.14	You who live in the land of Tema,
ISA.21.14	bring some food for the fugitives.
ISA.21.15	 For they flee from the swords – 
ISA.21.15	from the drawn sword
ISA.21.15	and from the battle-ready bow
ISA.21.15	and from the severity of the battle.
ISA.21.16	 For this is what the sovereign master
ISA.21.17	 Just a handful of archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be left.”
ISA.22.1	 Here is a message about the Valley of Vision:
ISA.22.1	What is the reason
ISA.22.1	that all of you go up to the rooftops?
ISA.22.2	 The noisy city is full of raucous sounds;
ISA.22.2	the town is filled with revelry.
ISA.22.2	Your slain were not cut down by the sword;
ISA.22.2	they did not die in battle.
ISA.22.3	 All your leaders ran away together – 
ISA.22.3	they fled to a distant place;
ISA.22.3	all your refugees
ISA.22.3	they were captured without a single arrow being shot.
ISA.22.4	 So I say:
ISA.22.4	“Don’t look at me!
ISA.22.4	I am weeping bitterly.
ISA.22.4	Don’t try
ISA.22.4	concerning the destruction of my defenseless people.”
ISA.22.5	 For the sovereign master,
ISA.22.5	has planned a day of panic, defeat, and confusion.
ISA.22.5	In the Valley of Vision
ISA.22.5	and cry out to the hill.
ISA.22.6	 The Elamites picked up the quiver,
ISA.22.6	and came with chariots and horsemen;
ISA.22.6	the men of Kir
ISA.22.7	 Your very best valleys were full of chariots;
ISA.22.7	horsemen confidently took their positions
ISA.22.8	 They
ISA.22.8	At that time
ISA.22.8	for the weapons in the House of the Forest.
ISA.22.9	 You saw the many breaks
ISA.22.9	in the walls of the city of David;
ISA.22.9	you stored up water in the lower pool.
ISA.22.10	 You counted the houses in Jerusalem,
ISA.22.10	and demolished houses so you could have material to reinforce the wall.
ISA.22.11	 You made a reservoir between the two walls
ISA.22.11	for the water of the old pool – 
ISA.22.11	but you did not trust in
ISA.22.11	you did not depend on
ISA.22.12	 At that time the sovereign master, the 
ISA.22.12	for shaved heads and sackcloth.
ISA.22.13	 But look, there is outright celebration!
ISA.22.13	You say, “Kill the ox and slaughter the sheep,
ISA.22.13	eat meat and drink wine.
ISA.22.13	Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”
ISA.22.14	 The 
ISA.22.15	 This is what the sovereign master, the 
ISA.22.15	“Go visit this administrator, Shebna, who supervises the palace,
ISA.22.16	 ‘What right do you have to be here? What relatives do you have buried here?
ISA.22.16	Why
ISA.22.16	He chisels out his burial site in an elevated place,
ISA.22.16	he carves out his tomb on a cliff.
ISA.22.17	 Look, the 
ISA.22.17	He will wrap you up tightly.
ISA.22.18	 He will wind you up tightly into a ball
ISA.22.18	and throw you into a wide, open land.
ISA.22.18	There you will die,
ISA.22.18	and there with you will be your impressive chariots,
ISA.22.18	which bring disgrace to the house of your master.
ISA.22.19	 I will remove you from
ISA.22.19	you will be thrown down
ISA.22.20	 “At that time
ISA.22.21	 I will put your robe on him, tie your belt around him, and transfer your authority to him.
ISA.22.22	 I will place the key
ISA.22.23	 I will fasten him like a peg into a solid place;
ISA.22.24	 His father’s family will gain increasing prominence because of him,
ISA.22.25	 “At that time,”
ISA.23.1	 Here is a message about Tyre:
ISA.23.1	Wail, you large ships,
ISA.23.1	for the port is too devastated to enter!
ISA.23.1	From the land of Cyprus
ISA.23.2	 Lament,
ISA.23.2	you merchants of Sidon
ISA.23.2	whose agents sail over 
ISA.23.3	 the deep waters!
ISA.23.3	Grain from the Shihor region,
ISA.23.3	crops grown near the Nile
ISA.23.3	she is the trade center
ISA.23.4	 Be ashamed, O Sidon, 
ISA.23.4	for the sea
ISA.23.4	“I have not gone into labor 
ISA.23.4	or given birth;
ISA.23.4	I have not raised young men
ISA.23.4	or brought up young women.”
ISA.23.5	 When the news reaches Egypt,
ISA.23.5	they will be shaken by what has happened to Tyre.
ISA.23.6	 Travel to Tarshish!
ISA.23.6	Wail, you residents of the coast!
ISA.23.7	 Is this really your boisterous city
ISA.23.7	whose origins are in the distant past,
ISA.23.7	and whose feet led her to a distant land to reside?
ISA.23.8	 Who planned this for royal Tyre,
ISA.23.8	whose merchants are princes,
ISA.23.8	whose traders are the dignitaries
ISA.23.9	 The 
ISA.23.9	to dishonor the pride that comes from all her beauty,
ISA.23.9	to humiliate all the dignitaries of the earth.
ISA.23.10	 Daughter Tarshish, travel back to your land, as one crosses the Nile;
ISA.23.10	there is no longer any marketplace in Tyre.
ISA.23.11	 The 
ISA.23.11	he shook kingdoms;
ISA.23.11	he
ISA.23.11	to destroy Canaan’s fortresses.
ISA.23.12	 He said,
ISA.23.12	“You will no longer celebrate,
ISA.23.12	oppressed
ISA.23.12	Get up, travel to Cyprus,
ISA.23.12	but you will find no relief there.”
ISA.23.13	 Look at the land of the Chaldeans,
ISA.23.13	these people who have lost their identity!
ISA.23.13	The Assyrians have made it a home for wild animals.
ISA.23.13	They erected their siege towers,
ISA.23.13	demolished
ISA.23.13	and turned it into a heap of ruins.
ISA.23.14	 Wail, you large ships,
ISA.23.14	for your fortress is destroyed!
ISA.23.15	 At that time
ISA.23.16	 “Take the harp,
ISA.23.16	go through the city,
ISA.23.16	forgotten prostitute!
ISA.23.16	Play it well,
ISA.23.16	play lots of songs,
ISA.23.16	so you’ll be noticed!”
ISA.23.17	 At the end of seventy years
ISA.23.18	 Her profits and earnings will be set apart for the 
ISA.24.1	 Look, the 
ISA.24.1	and leave it in ruins;
ISA.24.1	he will mar its surface
ISA.24.1	and scatter its inhabitants.
ISA.24.2	 Everyone will suffer – the priest as well as the people,
ISA.24.2	the master as well as the servant,
ISA.24.2	the elegant lady as well as the female attendant,
ISA.24.2	the seller as well as the buyer,
ISA.24.2	the borrower as well as the lender,
ISA.24.2	the creditor as well as the debtor.
ISA.24.3	 The earth will be completely devastated
ISA.24.3	and thoroughly ransacked.
ISA.24.3	For the 
ISA.24.4	 The earth
ISA.24.4	the world shrivels up and withers;
ISA.24.4	the prominent people of the earth
ISA.24.5	 The earth is defiled by
ISA.24.5	for they have violated laws,
ISA.24.5	disregarded the regulation,
ISA.24.5	and broken the permanent treaty.
ISA.24.6	 So a treaty curse
ISA.24.6	its inhabitants pay for their guilt.
ISA.24.6	This is why the inhabitants of the earth disappear,
ISA.24.6	and are reduced to just a handful of people.
ISA.24.7	 The new wine dries up,
ISA.24.7	the vines shrivel up,
ISA.24.7	all those who like to celebrate
ISA.24.8	 The happy sound
ISA.24.8	the revelry of those who celebrate comes to a halt,
ISA.24.8	the happy sound of the harp ceases.
ISA.24.9	 They no longer sing and drink wine;
ISA.24.9	the beer tastes bitter to those who drink it.
ISA.24.10	 The ruined town
ISA.24.10	all of the houses are shut up tight.
ISA.24.11	 They howl in the streets because of what happened to the wine;
ISA.24.11	all joy turns to sorrow;
ISA.24.11	celebrations disappear from the earth.
ISA.24.12	 The city is left in ruins;
ISA.24.12	the gate is reduced to rubble.
ISA.24.13	 This is what will happen throughout
ISA.24.13	among the nations.
ISA.24.13	It will be like when they beat an olive tree,
ISA.24.13	and just a few olives are left at the end of the harvest.
ISA.24.14	 They
ISA.24.14	they praise
ISA.24.15	 So in the east
ISA.24.15	along the seacoasts extol
ISA.24.16	 From the ends of the earth we
ISA.24.16	the Just One is majestic.
ISA.24.16	But I
ISA.24.16	Deceivers deceive, deceivers thoroughly deceive!”
ISA.24.17	 Terror, pit, and snare
ISA.24.17	are ready to overtake you inhabitants of the earth!
ISA.24.18	 The one who runs away from the sound of the terror
ISA.24.18	will fall into the pit;
ISA.24.18	the one who climbs out of the pit,
ISA.24.18	will be trapped by the snare.
ISA.24.18	For the floodgates of the heavens
ISA.24.18	and the foundations of the earth shake. 
ISA.24.19	 The earth is broken in pieces,
ISA.24.19	the earth is ripped to shreds,
ISA.24.19	the earth shakes violently.
ISA.24.20	 The earth will stagger around
ISA.24.20	it will sway back and forth like a hut in a windstorm.
ISA.24.20	Its sin will weigh it down,
ISA.24.20	and it will fall and never get up again.
ISA.24.21	 At that time
ISA.24.21	the heavenly forces in the heavens
ISA.24.21	and the earthly kings on the earth.
ISA.24.22	 They will be imprisoned in a pit,
ISA.24.22	locked up in a prison,
ISA.24.22	and after staying there for a long time,
ISA.24.23	 The full moon will be covered up,
ISA.24.23	the bright sun
ISA.24.23	for the 
ISA.24.23	on Mount Zion in Jerusalem
ISA.24.23	in the presence of his assembly, in majestic splendor.
ISA.25.1	 O 
ISA.25.1	I will exalt you in praise, I will extol your fame.
ISA.25.1	For you have done extraordinary things,
ISA.25.1	and executed plans made long ago exactly as you decreed.
ISA.25.2	 Indeed,
ISA.25.2	the fortified town into a heap of ruins;
ISA.25.2	the fortress of foreigners
ISA.25.2	it will never be rebuilt.
ISA.25.3	 So a strong nation will extol you;
ISA.25.3	the towns of
ISA.25.4	 For you are a protector for the poor,
ISA.25.4	a protector for the needy in their distress,
ISA.25.4	a shelter from the rainstorm,
ISA.25.4	a shade from the heat.
ISA.25.4	Though the breath of tyrants
ISA.25.5	 like heat
ISA.25.5	you humble the boasting foreigners.
ISA.25.5	Just as the shadow of a cloud causes the heat to subside,
ISA.25.5	so he causes the song of tyrants to cease.
ISA.25.6	 The 
ISA.25.6	At this banquet there will be plenty of meat and aged wine – 
ISA.25.6	tender meat and choicest wine.
ISA.25.7	 On this mountain he will swallow up 
ISA.25.7	the shroud that is over all the peoples,
ISA.25.7	the woven covering that is over all the nations;
ISA.25.8	 he will swallow up death permanently.
ISA.25.8	The sovereign 
ISA.25.8	and remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth.
ISA.25.8	Indeed, the 
ISA.25.9	 At that time they will say,
ISA.25.9	“Look, here
ISA.25.9	We waited for him and he delivered us.
ISA.25.9	Here
ISA.25.9	Let’s rejoice and celebrate his deliverance!”
ISA.25.10	 For the 
ISA.25.10	Moab will be trampled down where it stands,
ISA.25.10	as a heap of straw is trampled down in
ISA.25.11	 Moab
ISA.25.11	just as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim; 
ISA.25.11	the 
ISA.25.12	 The fortified city (along with the very tops of your
ISA.25.12	he will bring it down, he will throw it down to the dusty ground.
ISA.26.1	 At that time
ISA.26.1	“We have a strong city!
ISA.26.1	The 
ISA.26.2	 Open the gates so a righteous nation can enter – 
ISA.26.2	one that remains trustworthy.
ISA.26.3	 You keep completely safe the people who maintain their faith,
ISA.26.3	for they trust in you.
ISA.26.4	 Trust in the 
ISA.26.4	even in Yah, the 
ISA.26.5	 Indeed,
ISA.26.5	he brings down an elevated town;
ISA.26.5	he brings it down to the ground,
ISA.26.5	he throws it down to the dust.
ISA.26.6	 It is trampled underfoot
ISA.26.6	by the feet of the oppressed,
ISA.26.6	by the soles of the poor.”
ISA.26.7	 The way of the righteous is level, 
ISA.26.7	the path of the righteous that you make is straight.
ISA.26.8	 Yes, as your judgments unfold,
ISA.26.8	O 
ISA.26.8	We desire your fame and reputation to grow.
ISA.26.9	 I
ISA.26.9	my spirit within me seeks you at dawn,
ISA.26.9	for when your judgments come upon the earth,
ISA.26.9	those who live in the world learn about justice.
ISA.26.10	 If the wicked are shown mercy,
ISA.26.10	they do not learn about justice.
ISA.26.10	Even in a land where right is rewarded, they act unjustly;
ISA.26.10	they do not see the 
ISA.26.11	 O 
ISA.26.11	but they don’t even notice.
ISA.26.11	They will see and be put to shame by your angry judgment against humankind,
ISA.26.11	yes, fire will consume your enemies.
ISA.26.12	 O 
ISA.26.12	for even all we have accomplished, you have done for us.
ISA.26.13	 O 
ISA.26.13	masters other than you have ruled us,
ISA.26.13	but we praise your name alone.
ISA.26.14	 The dead do not come back to life,
ISA.26.14	the spirits of the dead do not rise.
ISA.26.14	That is because
ISA.26.14	you wiped out all memory of them.
ISA.26.15	 You have made the nation larger,
ISA.26.15	you have made the nation larger and revealed your splendor,
ISA.26.15	you have extended all the borders of the land.
ISA.26.16	 O 
ISA.26.16	they uttered incantations because of your discipline.
ISA.26.17	 As when a pregnant woman gets ready to deliver
ISA.26.17	and strains and cries out because of her labor pains,
ISA.26.17	so were we because of you, O 
ISA.26.18	 We were pregnant, we strained,
ISA.26.18	we gave birth, as it were, to wind.
ISA.26.18	We cannot produce deliverance on the earth;
ISA.26.18	people to populate the world are not born.
ISA.26.19	 Your dead will come back to life;
ISA.26.19	your corpses will rise up.
ISA.26.19	Wake up and shout joyfully, you who live in the ground!
ISA.26.19	For you will grow like plants drenched with the morning dew,
ISA.26.19	and the earth will bring forth its dead spirits.
ISA.26.20	 Go, my people! Enter your inner rooms!
ISA.26.20	Close your doors behind you!
ISA.26.20	Hide for a little while,
ISA.26.20	until his angry judgment is over!
ISA.26.21	 For look, the 
ISA.26.21	to punish the sin of those who live on the earth.
ISA.26.21	The earth will display the blood shed on it;
ISA.26.21	it will no longer cover up its slain.
ISA.27.1	 At that time
ISA.27.1	with his destructive,
ISA.27.1	Leviathan the fast-moving
ISA.27.1	Leviathan the squirming serpent;
ISA.27.1	he will kill the sea monster.
ISA.27.2	 When that time comes,
ISA.27.2	sing about a delightful vineyard!
ISA.27.3	 I, the 
ISA.27.3	I water it regularly.
ISA.27.3	I guard it night and day,
ISA.27.3	so no one can harm it.
ISA.27.4	 I am not angry.
ISA.27.4	I wish I could confront some thorns and briers!
ISA.27.4	Then I would march against them
ISA.27.4	I would set them
ISA.27.5	 unless they became my subjects
ISA.27.5	and made peace with me;
ISA.27.5	let them make peace with me.
ISA.27.6	 The time is coming when Jacob will take root;
ISA.27.6	Israel will blossom and grow branches.
ISA.27.6	The produce
ISA.27.7	 Has the 
ISA.27.7	Has Israel been killed like their enemies?
ISA.27.8	 When you summon her for divorce, you prosecute her;
ISA.27.8	he drives her away
ISA.27.9	 So in this way Jacob’s sin will be forgiven,
ISA.27.9	and this is how they will show they are finished sinning:
ISA.27.9	They will make all the stones of the altars
ISA.27.9	like crushed limestone,
ISA.27.9	and the Asherah poles and the incense altars will no longer stand.
ISA.27.10	 For the fortified city
ISA.27.10	it is a deserted settlement
ISA.27.10	and abandoned like the desert.
ISA.27.10	Calves
ISA.27.10	they lie down there
ISA.27.10	and eat its branches bare.
ISA.27.11	 When its branches get brittle,
ISA.27.11	women come and use them for kindling.
ISA.27.11	For these people lack understanding,
ISA.27.11	therefore the one who made them has no compassion on them;
ISA.27.11	the one who formed them has no mercy on them.
ISA.27.12	 At that time
ISA.27.13	 At that time
ISA.28.1	 The splendid crown of Ephraim’s drunkards is doomed,
ISA.28.1	the withering flower, its beautiful splendor,
ISA.28.1	situated
ISA.28.1	the crown of those overcome with wine.
ISA.28.2	 Look, the sovereign master
ISA.28.2	With the force of a hailstorm or a destructive windstorm,
ISA.28.2	with the might of a driving, torrential rainstorm,
ISA.28.2	he will knock that crown
ISA.28.3	 The splendid crown of Ephraim’s drunkards
ISA.28.3	will be trampled underfoot.
ISA.28.4	 The withering flower, its beautiful splendor,
ISA.28.4	situated at the head of a rich valley, 
ISA.28.4	will be like an early fig before harvest – 
ISA.28.4	as soon as someone notices it,
ISA.28.4	he grabs it and swallows it.
ISA.28.5	 At that time
ISA.28.5	and a splendid diadem for the remnant of his people.
ISA.28.6	 He will give discernment to the one who makes judicial decisions,
ISA.28.6	and strength to those who defend the city from attackers.
ISA.28.7	 Even these men
ISA.28.7	they stumble around because of beer – 
ISA.28.7	priests and prophets stagger because of beer,
ISA.28.7	they are confused
ISA.28.7	they stumble around because of beer;
ISA.28.7	they stagger while seeing prophetic visions,
ISA.28.7	they totter while making legal decisions.
ISA.28.8	 Indeed, all the tables are covered with vomit;
ISA.28.8	no place is untouched.
ISA.28.9	 Who is the 
ISA.28.9	To whom is he explaining a message?
ISA.28.9	Those just weaned from milk!
ISA.28.9	Those just taken from their mother’s breast!
ISA.28.10	 Indeed, they will hear meaningless gibberish,
ISA.28.10	senseless babbling,
ISA.28.10	a syllable here, a syllable there.
ISA.28.11	 For with mocking lips and a foreign tongue
ISA.28.11	he will speak to these people.
ISA.28.12	 In the past he said to them,
ISA.28.12	“This is where security can be found.
ISA.28.12	Provide security for the one who is exhausted!
ISA.28.12	This is where rest can be found.”
ISA.28.12	But they refused to listen.
ISA.28.13	 So the 
ISA.28.13	meaningless gibberish,
ISA.28.13	senseless babbling,
ISA.28.13	a syllable here, a syllable there.
ISA.28.13	As a result, they will fall on their backsides when they try to walk,
ISA.28.13	and be injured, ensnared, and captured.
ISA.28.14	 Therefore, listen to the 
ISA.28.14	you who mock,
ISA.28.14	you rulers of these people
ISA.28.14	who reside in Jerusalem!
ISA.28.15	 For you say,
ISA.28.15	“We have made a treaty with death,
ISA.28.15	with Sheol
ISA.28.15	When the overwhelming judgment sweeps by
ISA.28.15	it will not reach us.
ISA.28.15	For we have made a lie our refuge,
ISA.28.15	we have hidden ourselves in a deceitful word.”
ISA.28.16	 Therefore, this is what the sovereign master, the 
ISA.28.16	“Look, I am laying
ISA.28.16	an approved
ISA.28.16	set in place as a precious cornerstone for the foundation.
ISA.28.16	The one who maintains his faith will not panic.
ISA.28.17	 I will make justice the measuring line,
ISA.28.17	fairness the plumb line;
ISA.28.17	hail will sweep away the unreliable refuge,
ISA.28.17	the floodwaters will overwhelm the hiding place.
ISA.28.18	 Your treaty with death will be dissolved;
ISA.28.18	your agreement
ISA.28.18	When the overwhelming judgment sweeps by,
ISA.28.18	you will be overrun by it.
ISA.28.19	 Whenever it sweeps by, it will overtake you;
ISA.28.19	indeed,
ISA.28.19	it will come through during the day and the night.”
ISA.28.19	When this announcement is understood,
ISA.28.19	it will cause nothing but terror.
ISA.28.20	 For the bed is too short to stretch out on,
ISA.28.20	and the blanket is too narrow to wrap around oneself.
ISA.28.21	 For the 
ISA.28.21	he will rouse himself, as he did in the Valley of Gibeon,
ISA.28.21	to accomplish his work,
ISA.28.21	his peculiar work,
ISA.28.21	to perform his task,
ISA.28.21	his strange task.
ISA.28.22	 So now, do not mock,
ISA.28.22	or your chains will become heavier!
ISA.28.22	For I have heard a message about decreed destruction,
ISA.28.22	from the sovereign master, the 
ISA.28.23	 Pay attention and listen to my message!
ISA.28.23	Be attentive and listen to what I have to say!
ISA.28.24	 Does a farmer just keep on plowing at planting time?
ISA.28.24	Does he keep breaking up and harrowing his ground?
ISA.28.25	 Once he has leveled its surface, 
ISA.28.25	does he not scatter the seed of the caraway plant,
ISA.28.25	sow the seed of the cumin plant,
ISA.28.25	and plant the wheat, barley, and grain in their designated places?
ISA.28.26	 His God instructs him;
ISA.28.26	he teaches him the principles of agriculture.
ISA.28.27	 Certainly
ISA.28.27	nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin seed.
ISA.28.27	Certainly caraway seed is beaten with a stick,
ISA.28.27	and cumin seed with a flail.
ISA.28.28	 Grain is crushed,
ISA.28.28	though one certainly does not thresh it forever.
ISA.28.28	The wheel of one’s wagon rolls over it,
ISA.28.28	but his horses do not crush it.
ISA.28.29	 This also comes from the 
ISA.28.29	who gives supernatural guidance and imparts great wisdom.
ISA.29.1	 Ariel is as good as dead
ISA.29.1	Ariel, the town David besieged!
ISA.29.1	Keep observing your annual rituals,
ISA.29.1	celebrate your festivals on schedule.
ISA.29.2	 I will threaten Ariel,
ISA.29.2	and she will mourn intensely
ISA.29.2	and become like an altar hearth
ISA.29.3	 I will lay siege to you on all sides;
ISA.29.3	I will besiege you with troops;
ISA.29.3	I will raise siege works against you.
ISA.29.4	 You will fall; 
ISA.29.4	while lying on the ground
ISA.29.4	from the dust where you lie, your words will be heard.
ISA.29.4	Your voice will sound like a spirit speaking from the underworld;
ISA.29.4	from the dust you will chirp as if muttering an incantation.
ISA.29.5	 But the horde of invaders will be like fine dust,
ISA.29.5	the horde of tyrants
ISA.29.5	It will happen suddenly, in a flash.
ISA.29.6	 Judgment will come from the 
ISA.29.6	accompanied by thunder, earthquake, and a loud noise,
ISA.29.6	by a strong gale, a windstorm, and a consuming flame of fire.
ISA.29.7	 It will be like a dream, a night vision.
ISA.29.7	There will be a horde from all the nations that fight against Ariel,
ISA.29.7	those who attack her and her stronghold and besiege her.
ISA.29.8	 It will be like a hungry man dreaming that he is eating,
ISA.29.8	only to awaken and find that his stomach is empty.
ISA.29.8	It will be like a thirsty man dreaming that he is drinking,
ISA.29.8	only to awaken and find that he is still weak and his thirst unquenched.
ISA.29.8	So it will be for the horde from all the nations
ISA.29.8	that fight against Mount Zion.
ISA.29.9	 You will be shocked and amazed!
ISA.29.9	You are totally blind!
ISA.29.9	They are drunk,
ISA.29.9	they stagger,
ISA.29.10	 For the 
ISA.29.10	a strong urge to sleep deeply.
ISA.29.10	He has shut your eyes (the prophets),
ISA.29.10	and covered your heads (the seers).
ISA.29.11	 To you this entire prophetic revelation
ISA.29.12	 Or when they hand the scroll to one who can’t read
ISA.29.13	 The sovereign master
ISA.29.13	“These people say they are loyal to me;
ISA.29.13	they say wonderful things about me,
ISA.29.13	but they are not really loyal to me.
ISA.29.13	Their worship consists of 
ISA.29.13	nothing but man-made ritual.
ISA.29.14	 Therefore I will again do an amazing thing for these people – 
ISA.29.14	an absolutely extraordinary deed.
ISA.29.14	Wise men will have nothing to say,
ISA.29.14	the sages will have no explanations.”
ISA.29.15	 Those who try to hide their plans from the 
ISA.29.15	who do their work in secret and boast,
ISA.29.15	“Who sees us? Who knows what we’re doing?”
ISA.29.16	 Your thinking is perverse!
ISA.29.16	Should the potter be regarded as clay?
ISA.29.16	Should the thing made say
ISA.29.16	Or should the pottery say about the potter, “He doesn’t understand”?
ISA.29.17	 In just a very short time
ISA.29.17	Lebanon will turn into an orchard,
ISA.29.17	and the orchard will be considered a forest.
ISA.29.18	 At that time
ISA.29.18	and the eyes of the blind will be able to see through deep darkness.
ISA.29.19	 The downtrodden will again rejoice in the 
ISA.29.19	the poor among humankind will take delight
ISA.29.20	 For tyrants will disappear,
ISA.29.20	those who taunt will vanish,
ISA.29.20	and all those who love to do wrong will be eliminated
ISA.29.21	 those who bear false testimony against a person,
ISA.29.21	who entrap the one who arbitrates at the city gate
ISA.29.21	and deprive the innocent of justice by making false charges.
ISA.29.22	 So this is what the 
ISA.29.22	“Jacob will no longer be ashamed;
ISA.29.22	their faces will no longer show their embarrassment.
ISA.29.23	 For when they see their children,
ISA.29.23	whom I will produce among them,
ISA.29.23	they will honor
ISA.29.23	They will honor the Holy One of Jacob;
ISA.29.23	they will respect
ISA.29.24	 Those who stray morally will gain understanding;
ISA.29.24	those who complain will acquire insight.
ISA.30.1	 “The rebellious
ISA.30.1	“those who make plans without consulting me,
ISA.30.1	who form alliances without consulting my Spirit,
ISA.30.1	and thereby compound their sin.
ISA.30.2	 They travel down to Egypt
ISA.30.2	without seeking my will,
ISA.30.2	seeking Pharaoh’s protection,
ISA.30.2	and looking for safety in Egypt’s protective shade.
ISA.30.3	 But Pharaoh’s protection will bring you nothing but shame,
ISA.30.3	and the safety of Egypt’s protective shade nothing but humiliation.
ISA.30.4	 Though his
ISA.30.4	and his messengers arrive at Hanes,
ISA.30.5	 all will be put to shame
ISA.30.5	because of a nation that cannot help them,
ISA.30.5	who cannot give them aid or help,
ISA.30.5	but only shame and disgrace.”
ISA.30.6	 This is a message
ISA.30.6	Through a land of distress and danger,
ISA.30.6	inhabited by lionesses and roaring lions,
ISA.30.6	by snakes and darting adders,
ISA.30.6	they transport
ISA.30.6	their riches on the humps of camels,
ISA.30.6	to a nation that cannot help them.
ISA.30.7	 Egypt is totally incapable of helping.
ISA.30.7	For this reason I call her
ISA.30.7	‘Proud one
ISA.30.8	 Now go, write it
ISA.30.8	inscribe it on a scroll,
ISA.30.8	so that it might be preserved for a future time
ISA.30.8	as an enduring witness.
ISA.30.9	 For these are rebellious people – 
ISA.30.9	they are lying children,
ISA.30.9	children unwilling to obey the 
ISA.30.10	 They
ISA.30.10	and to the seers, “Don’t relate messages to us about what is right!
ISA.30.10	Tell us nice things,
ISA.30.10	relate deceptive messages.
ISA.30.11	 Turn aside from the way,
ISA.30.11	stray off the path.
ISA.30.11	Remove from our presence the Holy One of Israel.”
ISA.30.12	 For this reason this is what the Holy One of Israel says:
ISA.30.12	“You have rejected this message;
ISA.30.12	you trust instead in your ability to oppress and trick,
ISA.30.12	and rely on that kind of behavior.
ISA.30.13	 So this sin will become your downfall.
ISA.30.13	You will be like a high wall 
ISA.30.13	that bulges and cracks and is ready to collapse;
ISA.30.13	it crumbles suddenly, in a flash.
ISA.30.14	 It shatters in pieces like a clay jar,
ISA.30.14	so shattered to bits that none of it can be salvaged.
ISA.30.14	Among its fragments one cannot find a shard large enough
ISA.30.14	to scoop a hot coal from a fire
ISA.30.14	or to skim off water from a cistern.”
ISA.30.15	 For this is what the master, the 
ISA.30.15	“If you repented and patiently waited for me, you would be delivered;
ISA.30.15	if you calmly trusted in me you would find strength,
ISA.30.15	but you are unwilling.
ISA.30.16	 You say, ‘No, we will flee on horses,’
ISA.30.16	so you will indeed flee.
ISA.30.16	You say, ‘We will ride on fast horses,’
ISA.30.16	so your pursuers will be fast.
ISA.30.17	 One thousand will scurry at the battle cry of one enemy soldier;
ISA.30.17	at the battle cry of five enemy soldiers you will all run away,
ISA.30.17	until the remaining few are as isolated
ISA.30.17	as a flagpole on a mountaintop
ISA.30.17	or a signal flag on a hill.”
ISA.30.18	 For this reason the 
ISA.30.18	he sits on his throne, ready to have compassion on you.
ISA.30.18	Indeed, the 
ISA.30.18	all who wait for him in faith will be blessed.
ISA.30.19	 For people will live in Zion;
ISA.30.19	in Jerusalem
ISA.30.19	When he hears your cry of despair, he will indeed show you mercy;
ISA.30.19	when he hears it, he will respond to you.
ISA.30.20	 The sovereign master
ISA.30.20	and suffering to drink;
ISA.30.20	but your teachers will no longer be hidden;
ISA.30.20	your eyes will see them.
ISA.30.21	 You
ISA.30.21	“This is the correct
ISA.30.21	whether you are heading to the right or the left. 
ISA.30.22	 You will desecrate your silver-plated idols
ISA.30.22	and your gold-plated images.
ISA.30.22	You will throw them away as if they were a menstrual rag,
ISA.30.22	saying to them, “Get out!”
ISA.30.23	 He will water the seed you plant in the ground,
ISA.30.23	and the ground will produce crops in abundance.
ISA.30.23	At that time
ISA.30.24	 The oxen and donkeys used in plowing
ISA.30.24	will eat seasoned feed winnowed with a shovel and pitchfork.
ISA.30.25	 On every high mountain
ISA.30.25	and every high hill
ISA.30.25	there will be streams flowing with water,
ISA.30.25	at the time of
ISA.30.26	 The light of the full moon will be like the sun’s glare
ISA.30.26	and the sun’s glare will be seven times brighter,
ISA.30.26	like the light of seven days,
ISA.30.26	when the 
ISA.30.26	and heals their severe wound.
ISA.30.27	 Look, the name
ISA.30.27	in raging anger and awesome splendor.
ISA.30.27	He speaks angrily
ISA.30.27	and his word is like destructive fire.
ISA.30.28	 His battle cry overwhelms like a flooding river
ISA.30.28	that reaches one’s neck.
ISA.30.28	He shakes the nations in a sieve that isolates the chaff;
ISA.30.28	he puts a bit into the mouth of the nations and leads them to destruction.
ISA.30.29	 You will sing
ISA.30.29	as you do in the evening when you are celebrating a festival.
ISA.30.29	You will be happy like one who plays a flute
ISA.30.29	as he goes to the mountain of the 
ISA.30.30	 The 
ISA.30.30	and intervene in power,
ISA.30.30	with furious anger and flaming, destructive fire,
ISA.30.30	with a driving rainstorm and hailstones.
ISA.30.31	 Indeed, the 
ISA.30.31	he will beat them with a club.
ISA.30.32	 Every blow from his punishing cudgel,
ISA.30.32	with which the 
ISA.30.32	will be accompanied by music from the
ISA.30.32	and he will attack them with his weapons.
ISA.30.33	 For
ISA.30.33	it has been made deep and wide for the king.
ISA.30.33	The firewood is piled high on it.
ISA.30.33	The 
ISA.30.33	will ignite it.
ISA.31.1	 Those who go down to Egypt for help are as good as dead,
ISA.31.1	those who rely on war horses,
ISA.31.1	and trust in Egypt’s many chariots
ISA.31.1	and in their many, many horsemen.
ISA.31.1	But they do not rely on the Holy One of Israel
ISA.31.1	and do not seek help from the 
ISA.31.2	 Yet he too is wise
ISA.31.2	he does not retract his decree.
ISA.31.2	He will attack the wicked nation,
ISA.31.2	and the nation that helps
ISA.31.3	 The Egyptians are mere humans, not God;
ISA.31.3	their horses are made of flesh, not spirit.
ISA.31.3	The 
ISA.31.3	the one who helps will stumble
ISA.31.3	and the one being helped will fall.
ISA.31.3	Together they will perish.
ISA.31.4	 Indeed, this is what the 
ISA.31.4	“The 
ISA.31.4	like a young lion growling over its prey.
ISA.31.4	Though a whole group of shepherds gathers against it,
ISA.31.4	it is not afraid of their shouts
ISA.31.4	or intimidated by their yelling.
ISA.31.4	In this same way the 
ISA.31.4	to do battle on Mount Zion and on its hill.
ISA.31.5	 Just as birds hover over a nest,
ISA.31.5	so the 
ISA.31.5	He will protect and deliver it;
ISA.31.5	as he passes over
ISA.31.6	 You Israelites! Return to the one against whom you have so blatantly rebelled!
ISA.31.7	 For at that time
ISA.31.8	 Assyria will fall by a sword, but not one human-made;
ISA.31.8	a sword not made by humankind will destroy them.
ISA.31.8	They will run away from this sword
ISA.31.8	and their young men will be forced to do hard labor. 
ISA.31.9	 They will surrender their stronghold
ISA.31.9	their officers will be afraid of the 
ISA.31.9	This is what the 
ISA.31.9	the one whose fire is in Zion,
ISA.31.9	whose firepot is in Jerusalem.
ISA.32.1	 Look, a king will promote fairness;
ISA.32.1	officials will promote justice.
ISA.32.2	 Each of them
ISA.32.2	and a refuge from a rainstorm;
ISA.32.2	like streams of water in a dry region
ISA.32.2	and like the shade of a large cliff in a parched land.
ISA.32.3	 Eyes
ISA.32.3	and ears
ISA.32.4	 The mind that acts rashly will possess discernment
ISA.32.4	and the tongue that stutters will speak with ease and clarity.
ISA.32.5	 A fool will no longer be called honorable;
ISA.32.5	a deceiver will no longer be called principled.
ISA.32.6	 For a fool speaks disgraceful things;
ISA.32.6	his mind plans out sinful deeds.
ISA.32.6	He commits godless deeds
ISA.32.6	and says misleading things about the 
ISA.32.6	he gives the hungry nothing to satisfy their appetite
ISA.32.6	and gives the thirsty nothing to drink.
ISA.32.7	 A deceiver’s methods are evil;
ISA.32.7	he dreams up evil plans
ISA.32.7	to ruin the poor with lies,
ISA.32.7	even when the needy are in the right.
ISA.32.8	 An honorable man makes honorable plans;
ISA.32.8	his honorable character gives him security.
ISA.32.9	 You complacent
ISA.32.9	get up and listen to me!
ISA.32.9	You carefree
ISA.32.9	pay attention to what I say!
ISA.32.10	 In a year’s time
ISA.32.10	you carefree ones will shake with fear,
ISA.32.10	for the grape
ISA.32.10	and the fruit harvest will not arrive.
ISA.32.11	 Tremble, you complacent ones!
ISA.32.11	Shake with fear, you carefree ones!
ISA.32.11	Strip off your clothes and expose yourselves – 
ISA.32.11	put sackcloth on your waist!
ISA.32.12	 Mourn over the field,
ISA.32.12	over the delightful fields
ISA.32.12	and the fruitful vine!
ISA.32.13	 Mourn
ISA.32.13	which is overgrown with thorns and briers,
ISA.32.13	and over all the once-happy houses
ISA.32.13	in the city filled with revelry.
ISA.32.14	 For the fortress is neglected;
ISA.32.14	the once-crowded
ISA.32.14	Hill
ISA.32.14	are permanently uninhabited.
ISA.32.14	Wild donkeys love to go there,
ISA.32.14	and flocks graze there.
ISA.32.15	 This desolation will continue until new life is poured out on us from heaven.
ISA.32.15	Then the desert will become an orchard
ISA.32.15	and the orchard will be considered a forest.
ISA.32.16	 Justice will settle down in the desert
ISA.32.16	and fairness will live in the orchard.
ISA.32.17	 Fairness will produce peace
ISA.32.17	and result in lasting security.
ISA.32.18	 My people will live in peaceful settlements,
ISA.32.18	in secure homes,
ISA.32.18	and in safe, quiet places.
ISA.32.19	 Even if the forest is destroyed
ISA.32.19	and the city is annihilated,
ISA.32.20	 you will be blessed,
ISA.32.20	you who plant seed by all the banks of the streams,
ISA.32.20	you who let your ox and donkey graze.
ISA.33.1	 The destroyer is as good as dead,
ISA.33.1	you who have not been destroyed!
ISA.33.1	The deceitful one is as good as dead,
ISA.33.1	the one whom others have not deceived!
ISA.33.1	When you are through destroying, you will be destroyed;
ISA.33.1	when you finish
ISA.33.2	Give us strength each morning!
ISA.33.2	Deliver us when distress comes.
ISA.33.3	 The nations run away when they hear a loud noise;
ISA.33.3	the nations scatter when you spring into action!
ISA.33.4	 Your plunder
ISA.33.4	they swarm over it like locusts!

ISA.36.1	 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign,
ISA.36.2	 The king of Assyria sent his chief adviser
ISA.36.3	 Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went out to meet him. 
ISA.36.4	 The chief adviser said to them, “Tell Hezekiah: ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: “What is your source of confidence?
ISA.36.5	 Your claim to have a strategy and military strength is just empty talk.
ISA.36.6	 Look, you must be trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed staff. If someone leans on it for support, it punctures his hand and wounds him. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt does to all who trust in him! 
ISA.36.7	 Perhaps you will tell me, ‘We are trusting in the

ISA.36.9	 Certainly you will not refuse one of my master’s minor officials and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen.
ISA.36.10	 Furthermore it was by the command of the 
ISA.36.11	 Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the chief adviser, “Speak to your servants in Aramaic,
ISA.36.12	 But the chief adviser said, “My master did not send me to speak these words only to your master and to you.
ISA.36.13	 The chief adviser then stood there and called out loudly in the Judahite dialect,
ISA.36.14	 This is what the king says: ‘Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you, for he is not able to rescue you! 
ISA.36.15	 Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the 
ISA.36.16	 Don’t listen to Hezekiah!’ For this is what the king of Assyria says, ‘Send me a token of your submission and surrender to me.

ISA.36.18	 Hezekiah is misleading you when he says, “The

ISA.36.20	 Who among all the gods of these lands have rescued their lands from my power? So how can the

ISA.36.22	 Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn in grief
ISA.37.1	 When King Hezekiah heard this,
ISA.37.2	 Eliakim the palace supervisor, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests,
ISA.37.3	 “This is what Hezekiah says:

ISA.37.23	At whom have you shouted
ISA.37.23	and looked so arrogantly?
ISA.37.23	At the Holy One of Israel!
ISA.37.24	 Through your messengers you taunted the sovereign master,
ISA.37.24	‘With my many chariots I climbed up
ISA.37.24	the high mountains,
ISA.37.24	the slopes of Lebanon.
ISA.37.24	I cut down its tall cedars
ISA.37.24	and its best evergreens.
ISA.37.24	I invaded its most remote regions,
ISA.37.24	its thickest woods.
ISA.37.25	 I dug wells
ISA.37.25	and drank water.
ISA.37.25	With the soles of my feet I dried up
ISA.37.25	all the rivers of Egypt.’
ISA.37.26	 Certainly you must have heard!
ISA.37.26	Long ago I worked it out,
ISA.37.26	in ancient times I planned
ISA.37.26	and now I am bringing it to pass.
ISA.37.26	The plan is this:
ISA.37.26	Fortified cities will crash
ISA.37.26	into heaps of ruins.
ISA.37.27	 Their residents are powerless;
ISA.37.27	they are terrified and ashamed.
ISA.37.27	They are as short-lived as plants in the field
ISA.37.27	or green vegetation.
ISA.37.27	They are as short-lived as grass on the rooftops
ISA.37.27	when it is scorched by the east wind.
ISA.37.28	 I know where you live
ISA.37.28	and everything you do
ISA.37.28	and how you rage against me.
ISA.37.29	 Because you rage against me
ISA.37.29	and the uproar you create has reached my ears,
ISA.37.29	I will put my hook in your nose,
ISA.37.29	and my bridle between your lips,
ISA.37.29	and I will lead you back 
ISA.37.29	the way you came.”
ISA.37.30	 “This will be your reminder that I have spoken the truth:
ISA.37.31	 Those who remain in Judah will take root in the ground and bear fruit.

ISA.37.34	 He will go back the way he came – 
ISA.37.34	he will not enter this city,’ says the 
ISA.37.35	 I will shield this city and rescue it for the sake of my reputation and because of my promise to David my servant.”’”

ISA.37.37	 So King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and went on his way. He went home and stayed in Nineveh.
ISA.37.38	 One day,
ISA.38.1	 In those days Hezekiah was stricken with a terminal illness.
ISA.38.2	 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the 
ISA.38.3	 “Please, 
ISA.38.4	 The 
ISA.38.5	 “Go and tell Hezekiah: ‘This is what the 
ISA.38.6	 and rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will shield this city.”’”

ISA.38.8	 Look, I will make the shadow go back ten steps on the stairs of Ahaz.”
ISA.38.9	 This is the prayer of King Hezekiah of Judah when he was sick and then recovered from his illness:
ISA.38.10	 “I thought,
ISA.38.10	‘In the middle of my life
ISA.38.10	I am deprived

ISA.38.13	like a lion he shatters all my bones;
ISA.38.13	you turn day into night and end my life.
ISA.38.14	 Like a swallow or a thrush I chirp,
ISA.38.14	I coo

ISA.40.22	its inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him.
ISA.40.22	He is the one who stretches out the sky like a thin curtain,
ISA.40.22	and spreads it out

ISA.41.5	 The coastlands
ISA.41.5	the whole earth
ISA.41.5	they approach and come.
ISA.41.6	 They help one another;
ISA.41.6	one says to the other, ‘Be strong!’
ISA.41.7	 The craftsman encourages the metalsmith,
ISA.41.7	the one who wields the hammer encourages
ISA.41.7	He approves the quality of the welding,
ISA.41.7	and nails it down so it won’t fall over.”
ISA.41.8	 “You, my servant Israel,
ISA.41.8	Jacob whom I have chosen,
ISA.41.8	offspring of Abraham my friend,
ISA.41.9	 you whom I am bringing back
ISA.41.9	and have summoned from the remote regions – 
ISA.41.9	I told you, “You are my servant.”
ISA.41.9	I have chosen you and not rejected you.
ISA.41.10	 Don’t be afraid, for I am with you!
ISA.41.10	Don’t be frightened, for I am your God!
ISA.41.10	I strengthen you – 
ISA.41.10	yes, I help you – 
ISA.41.10	yes, I uphold you with my saving right hand!
ISA.41.11	 Look, all who were angry at you will be ashamed and humiliated;
ISA.41.11	your adversaries
ISA.41.12	 When you will look for your opponents,
ISA.41.12	your enemies
ISA.41.13	 For I am the 
ISA.41.13	the one who takes hold of your right hand,
ISA.41.13	who says to you, ‘Don’t be afraid, I am helping you.’
ISA.41.14	 Don’t be afraid, despised insignificant Jacob,
ISA.41.14	men of
ISA.41.14	I am helping you,” says the 
ISA.41.14	your protector,
ISA.41.15	 “Look, I am making you like
ISA.41.15	new and double-edged.
ISA.41.15	You will thresh the mountains and crush them;
ISA.41.15	you will make the hills like straw.
ISA.41.16	 You will winnow them and the wind will blow them away;
ISA.41.16	the wind will scatter them.
ISA.41.16	You will rejoice in the 
ISA.41.16	you will boast in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.41.17	 The oppressed and the poor look for water, but there is none;
ISA.41.17	their tongues are parched from thirst.
ISA.41.17	I, the 
ISA.41.17	I, the God of Israel, will not abandon them.
ISA.41.18	 I will make streams flow down the slopes
ISA.41.18	and produce springs in the middle of the valleys.
ISA.41.18	I will turn the desert into a pool of water
ISA.41.18	and the arid land into springs.
ISA.41.19	 I will make cedars, acacias, myrtles, and olive trees grow in the wilderness;
ISA.41.19	I will make evergreens, firs, and cypresses grow together in the desert.
ISA.41.20	 I will do this so
ISA.41.20	so they will pay attention and understand
ISA.41.20	that the 
ISA.41.20	and that the Holy One of Israel has brought it into being.”
ISA.41.21	 “Present your argument,” says the 
ISA.41.21	“Produce your evidence,”
ISA.41.22	 “Let them produce evidence! Let them tell us what will happen!
ISA.41.22	Tell us about your earlier predictive oracles,
ISA.41.22	so we may examine them
ISA.41.22	Or decree for us some future events!
ISA.41.23	 Predict how future events will turn out,
ISA.41.23	so we might know you are gods.
ISA.41.23	Yes, do something good or bad, 
ISA.41.23	so we might be frightened and in awe.
ISA.41.24	 Look, you are nothing, and your accomplishments are nonexistent;
ISA.41.24	the one who chooses to worship you is disgusting.
ISA.41.25	 I have stirred up one out of the north
ISA.41.25	one from the eastern horizon who prays in my name.
ISA.41.25	He steps on
ISA.41.25	like a potter treading the clay.
ISA.41.26	 Who decreed this from the beginning, so we could know?
ISA.41.26	Who announced it
ISA.41.26	Indeed, none of them decreed it!
ISA.41.26	Indeed, none of them announced it!
ISA.41.26	Indeed, no one heard you say anything!
ISA.41.27	 I first decreed to Zion, ‘Look, here’s what will happen!’
ISA.41.27	I sent a herald to Jerusalem.
ISA.41.28	 I look, but there is no one,
ISA.41.28	among them there is no one who serves as an adviser,
ISA.41.28	that I might ask questions and receive answers.
ISA.41.29	 Look, all of them are nothing,
ISA.41.29	their accomplishments are nonexistent;
ISA.41.29	their metal images lack any real substance.
ISA.42.1	 “Here is my servant whom I support,
ISA.42.1	my chosen one in whom I take pleasure.
ISA.42.1	I have placed my spirit on him;
ISA.42.1	he will make just decrees
ISA.42.2	 He will not cry out or shout;
ISA.42.2	he will not publicize himself in the streets.
ISA.42.3	 A crushed reed he will not break,
ISA.42.3	a dim wick he will not extinguish;
ISA.42.3	he will faithfully make just decrees.
ISA.42.4	 He will not grow dim or be crushed
ISA.42.4	before establishing justice on the earth;
ISA.42.4	the coastlands
ISA.42.5	 This is what the true God,
ISA.42.5	the one who created the sky and stretched it out,
ISA.42.5	the one who fashioned the earth and everything that lives on it,
ISA.42.5	the one who gives breath to the people on it,
ISA.42.5	and life to those who live on it:
ISA.42.6	 “I, the 
ISA.42.6	I take hold of your hand.
ISA.42.6	I protect you
ISA.42.6	and a light
ISA.42.7	 to open blind eyes,
ISA.42.7	to release prisoners
ISA.42.7	those who live in darkness from prisons.
ISA.42.8	 I am the 
ISA.42.8	I will not share my glory with anyone else,
ISA.42.8	or the praise due me with idols.
ISA.42.9	 Look, my earlier predictive oracles have come to pass;
ISA.42.9	now I announce new events.
ISA.42.9	Before they begin to occur,
ISA.42.9	I reveal them to you.”
ISA.42.10	 Sing to the 
ISA.42.10	Praise him
ISA.42.10	you who go down to the sea, and everything that lives in it,
ISA.42.10	you coastlands
ISA.42.11	 Let the desert and its cities shout out,
ISA.42.11	the towns where the nomads of Kedar live!
ISA.42.11	Let the residents of Sela shout joyfully;
ISA.42.11	let them shout loudly from the mountaintops.
ISA.42.12	 Let them give the 
ISA.42.12	let them praise his deeds in the coastlands.
ISA.42.13	 The 
ISA.42.13	like a warrior he inspires himself for battle;
ISA.42.13	he shouts, yes, he yells,
ISA.42.13	he shows his enemies his power.
ISA.42.14	 “I have been inactive
ISA.42.14	I kept quiet and held back.
ISA.42.14	Like a woman in labor I groan;
ISA.42.14	I pant and gasp.
ISA.42.15	 I will make the trees on the mountains and hills wither up;
ISA.42.15	I will dry up all their vegetation.
ISA.42.15	I will turn streams into islands,
ISA.42.15	and dry up pools of water.
ISA.42.16	 I will lead the blind along an unfamiliar way;
ISA.42.16	I will guide them down paths they have never traveled.
ISA.42.16	I will turn the darkness in front of them into light,
ISA.42.16	and level out the rough ground.
ISA.42.16	This is what I will do for them.
ISA.42.16	I will not abandon them.
ISA.42.17	 Those who trust in idols
ISA.42.17	will turn back and be utterly humiliated,
ISA.42.17	those who say to metal images, ‘You are our gods.’”
ISA.42.18	 “Listen, you deaf ones!
ISA.42.18	Take notice,
ISA.42.19	 My servant is truly blind,
ISA.42.19	my messenger is truly deaf.
ISA.42.19	My covenant partner,
ISA.42.20	 You see
ISA.42.20	their ears are open, but do not hear.”
ISA.42.21	 The 
ISA.42.21	by magnifying his law and displaying it.
ISA.42.22	 But these people are looted and plundered;
ISA.42.22	all of them are trapped in pits
ISA.42.22	and held captive
ISA.42.22	They were carried away as loot with no one to rescue them;
ISA.42.22	they were carried away as plunder, and no one says, “Bring that back!”
ISA.42.23	 Who among you will pay attention to this?
ISA.42.23	Who will listen attentively in the future?
ISA.42.24	 Who handed Jacob over to the robber?
ISA.42.24	Who handed Israel over to the looters?
ISA.42.24	Was it not the 
ISA.42.24	They refused to follow his commands;
ISA.42.24	they disobeyed his law.
ISA.42.25	 So he poured out his fierce anger on them,
ISA.42.25	along with the devastation
ISA.42.25	Its flames encircled them, but they did not realize it;
ISA.42.25	it burned against them, but they did notice.
ISA.43.1	 Now, this is what the 
ISA.43.1	the one who created you, O Jacob,
ISA.43.1	and formed you, O Israel:
ISA.43.1	“Don’t be afraid, for I will protect
ISA.43.1	I call you by name, you are mine.
ISA.43.2	 When you pass through the waters, I am with you;
ISA.43.2	when you pass
ISA.43.2	When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned;
ISA.43.2	the flames will not harm
ISA.43.3	 For I am the 
ISA.43.3	the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.43.3	I have handed over Egypt as a ransom price,
ISA.43.3	Ethiopia and Seba
ISA.43.4	 Since you are precious and special in my sight,
ISA.43.4	and I love you,
ISA.43.4	I will hand over people in place of you,
ISA.43.4	nations in place of your life.
ISA.43.5	 Don’t be afraid, for I am with you.
ISA.43.5	From the east I will bring your descendants;
ISA.43.5	from the west I will gather you.
ISA.43.6	 I will say to the north, ‘Hand them over!’
ISA.43.6	and to the south, ‘Don’t hold any back!’
ISA.43.6	Bring my sons from distant lands,
ISA.43.6	and my daughters from the remote regions of the earth,
ISA.43.7	 everyone who belongs to me,
ISA.43.7	whom I created for my glory,
ISA.43.7	whom I formed – yes, whom I made!
ISA.43.8	 Bring out the people who are blind, even though they have eyes,
ISA.43.8	those who are deaf, even though they have ears!
ISA.43.9	 All nations gather together,
ISA.43.9	the peoples assemble.
ISA.43.9	Who among them announced this?
ISA.43.9	Who predicted earlier events for us?
ISA.43.9	Let them produce their witnesses to testify they were right;
ISA.43.9	let them listen and affirm, ‘It is true.’
ISA.43.10	 You are my witnesses,” says the 
ISA.43.10	“my servant whom I have chosen,
ISA.43.10	so that you may consider
ISA.43.10	and understand that I am he.
ISA.43.10	No god was formed before me,
ISA.43.10	and none will outlive me.
ISA.43.11	 I, I am the 
ISA.43.11	and there is no deliverer besides me.
ISA.43.12	 I decreed and delivered and proclaimed,
ISA.43.12	and there was no other god among you.
ISA.43.12	You are my witnesses,” says the 
ISA.43.13	 From this day forward I am he;
ISA.43.13	no one can deliver from my power;
ISA.43.13	I will act, and who can prevent it?”
ISA.43.14	 This is what the 
ISA.43.14	your protector,
ISA.43.14	“For your sake I send to Babylon
ISA.43.14	and make them all fugitives,
ISA.43.14	turning the Babylonians’ joyful shouts into mourning songs.
ISA.43.15	 I am the 
ISA.43.15	the one who created Israel, your king.”
ISA.43.16	 This is what the 
ISA.43.16	the one who made a road through the sea,
ISA.43.16	a pathway through the surging waters,
ISA.43.17	 the one who led chariots and horses to destruction,
ISA.43.17	together with a mighty army.
ISA.43.17	They fell down,
ISA.43.17	they were extinguished, put out like a burning wick:
ISA.43.18	 “Don’t remember these earlier events;
ISA.43.18	don’t recall these former events.
ISA.43.19	 “Look, I am about to do something new.
ISA.43.19	Now it begins to happen!
ISA.43.19	Yes, I will make a road in the desert
ISA.43.19	and paths
ISA.43.20	 The wild animals of the desert honor me,
ISA.43.20	the jackals and ostriches,
ISA.43.20	because I put water in the desert
ISA.43.20	and streams in the wilderness,
ISA.43.20	to quench the thirst of my chosen people,
ISA.43.21	 the people whom I formed for myself,
ISA.43.21	so they might praise me.”
ISA.43.22	 “But you did not call for me, O Jacob;
ISA.43.22	you did not long
ISA.43.23	 You did not bring me lambs for your burnt offerings;
ISA.43.23	you did not honor me with your sacrifices.
ISA.43.23	I did not burden you with offerings;
ISA.43.23	I did not make you weary by demanding
ISA.43.24	 You did not buy me aromatic reeds;
ISA.43.24	you did not present to me
ISA.43.24	Yet you burdened me with your sins;
ISA.43.24	you made me weary with your evil deeds.
ISA.43.25	 I, I am the one who blots out your rebellious deeds for my sake;
ISA.43.25	your sins I do not remember.
ISA.43.26	 Remind me of what happened! Let’s debate!
ISA.43.26	You, prove to me that you are right!
ISA.43.27	 The father of your nation
ISA.43.27	your spokesmen
ISA.43.28	 So I defiled your holy princes,
ISA.43.28	and handed Jacob over to destruction,
ISA.43.28	and subjected
ISA.44.1	 “Now, listen, Jacob my servant,
ISA.44.1	Israel whom I have chosen!”
ISA.44.2	 This is what the 
ISA.44.2	the one who formed you in the womb and helps you:
ISA.44.2	“Don’t be afraid, my servant Jacob,
ISA.44.2	Jeshurun,
ISA.44.3	 For I will pour water on the parched ground
ISA.44.3	and cause streams to flow
ISA.44.3	I will pour my spirit on your offspring
ISA.44.3	and my blessing on your children.
ISA.44.4	 They will sprout up like a tree in the grass,
ISA.44.4	like poplars beside channels of water.
ISA.44.5	 One will say, ‘I belong to the 
ISA.44.5	and another will use
ISA.44.5	One will write on his hand, ‘The 
ISA.44.5	and use the name ‘Israel.’”
ISA.44.6	 This is what the 
ISA.44.6	their protector,
ISA.44.6	“I am the first and I am the last,
ISA.44.6	there is no God but me.
ISA.44.7	 Who is like me? Let him make his claim!
ISA.44.7	Let him announce it and explain it to me – 
ISA.44.7	since I established an ancient people – 
ISA.44.7	let them announce future events!
ISA.44.8	 Don’t panic! Don’t be afraid!
ISA.44.8	Did I not tell you beforehand and decree it?
ISA.44.8	You are my witnesses! Is there any God but me?
ISA.44.8	There is no other sheltering rock;
ISA.44.9	 All who form idols are nothing;
ISA.44.9	the things in which they delight are worthless.
ISA.44.9	Their witnesses cannot see;
ISA.44.9	they recognize nothing, so they are put to shame.
ISA.44.10	 Who forms a god and casts an idol
ISA.44.10	that will prove worthless?
ISA.44.11	 Look, all his associates
ISA.44.11	the craftsmen are mere humans.
ISA.44.11	Let them all assemble and take their stand!
ISA.44.11	They will panic and be put to shame.
ISA.44.12	 A blacksmith works with his tool
ISA.44.12	and forges metal over the coals.
ISA.44.12	He forms it
ISA.44.12	he makes it with his strong arm.
ISA.44.12	He gets hungry and loses his energy;
ISA.44.12	he drinks no water and gets tired.
ISA.44.13	 A carpenter takes measurements;
ISA.44.13	he marks out an outline of its form;
ISA.44.13	he scrapes
ISA.44.13	and marks it with a compass.
ISA.44.13	He patterns it after the human form,
ISA.44.13	like a well-built human being,
ISA.44.13	and puts it in a shrine.
ISA.44.14	 He cuts down cedars
ISA.44.14	and acquires a cypress
ISA.44.14	He gets
ISA.44.14	he plants a cedar
ISA.44.15	 A man uses it to make a fire;
ISA.44.15	he takes some of it and warms himself.
ISA.44.15	Yes, he kindles a fire and bakes bread.
ISA.44.15	Then he makes a god and worships it;
ISA.44.15	he makes an idol and bows down to it.
ISA.44.16	 Half of it he burns in the fire – 
ISA.44.16	over that half he cooks
ISA.44.16	he roasts a meal and fills himself.
ISA.44.16	Yes, he warms himself and says,
ISA.44.16	‘Ah! I am warm as I look at the fire.’
ISA.44.17	 With the rest of it he makes a god, his idol;
ISA.44.17	he bows down to it and worships it.
ISA.44.17	He prays to it, saying,
ISA.44.17	‘Rescue me, for you are my god!’
ISA.44.18	 They do not comprehend or understand,
ISA.44.18	for their eyes are blind and cannot see;
ISA.44.18	their minds do not discern.
ISA.44.19	 No one thinks to himself,
ISA.44.19	nor do they comprehend or understand and say to themselves:
ISA.44.19	‘I burned half of it in the fire – 
ISA.44.19	yes, I baked bread over the coals;
ISA.44.19	I roasted meat and ate it.
ISA.44.19	With the rest of it should I make a disgusting idol?
ISA.44.19	Should I bow down to dry wood?’
ISA.44.20	 He feeds on ashes;
ISA.44.20	his deceived mind misleads him.
ISA.44.20	He cannot rescue himself,
ISA.44.20	nor does he say, ‘Is this not a false god I hold in my right hand?’
ISA.44.21	 Remember these things, O Jacob,
ISA.44.21	O Israel, for you are my servant.
ISA.44.21	I formed you to be my servant;
ISA.44.21	O Israel, I will not forget you!
ISA.44.22	 I remove the guilt of your rebellious deeds as if they were a cloud,
ISA.44.22	the guilt of your sins as if they were a cloud.
ISA.44.22	Come back to me, for I protect
ISA.44.23	 Shout for joy, O sky, for the 
ISA.44.23	shout out, you subterranean regions
ISA.44.23	O mountains, give a joyful shout;
ISA.44.23	you too, O forest and all your trees!
ISA.44.23	For the 
ISA.44.23	he reveals his splendor through Israel.
ISA.44.24	 This is what the 
ISA.44.24	the one who formed you in the womb:
ISA.44.24	“I am the 
ISA.44.24	who alone stretched out the sky,
ISA.44.24	who fashioned the earth all by myself,
ISA.44.25	 who frustrates the omens of the empty talkers
ISA.44.25	and humiliates
ISA.44.25	who overturns the counsel of the wise men
ISA.44.25	and makes their advice
ISA.44.26	 who fulfills the oracles of his prophetic servants
ISA.44.26	and brings to pass the announcements
ISA.44.26	who says about Jerusalem,
ISA.44.26	and about the towns of Judah, ‘They will be rebuilt,
ISA.44.26	her ruins I will raise up,’
ISA.44.27	 who says to the deep sea, ‘Be dry!
ISA.44.27	I will dry up your sea currents,’ 
ISA.44.28	 who commissions
ISA.44.28	to carry out all my wishes
ISA.44.28	and to decree concerning Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’
ISA.44.28	and concerning the temple, ‘It will be reconstructed.’”
ISA.45.1	 This is what the 
ISA.45.1	to Cyrus, whose right hand I hold
ISA.45.1	in order to subdue nations before him,
ISA.45.1	and disarm kings,
ISA.45.1	to open doors before him,
ISA.45.1	so gates remain unclosed:
ISA.45.2	 “I will go before you
ISA.45.2	and level mountains.
ISA.45.2	Bronze doors I will shatter
ISA.45.2	and iron bars
ISA.45.3	 I will give you hidden treasures,
ISA.45.3	riches stashed away in secret places,
ISA.45.3	so you may recognize that I am the 
ISA.45.3	the one who calls you by name, the God of Israel.
ISA.45.4	 For the sake of my servant Jacob,
ISA.45.4	Israel, my chosen one,
ISA.45.4	I call you by name
ISA.45.4	and give you a title of respect, even though you do not recognize
ISA.45.5	 I am the 
ISA.45.5	there is no God but me.
ISA.45.5	I arm you for battle,
ISA.45.6	 I do this
ISA.45.6	that there is no God but me;
ISA.45.6	I am the 
ISA.45.7	 I am
ISA.45.7	and creates darkness;
ISA.45.7	the one who brings about peace
ISA.45.7	and creates calamity.
ISA.45.7	I am the 
ISA.45.8	 O sky, rain down from above!
ISA.45.8	Let the clouds send down showers
ISA.45.8	Let the earth absorb it
ISA.45.8	and deliverance may sprout up
ISA.45.8	I, the 
ISA.45.9	 One who argues with his creator is in grave danger,
ISA.45.9	one who is like a mere
ISA.45.9	The clay should not say to the potter,
ISA.45.9	“What in the world
ISA.45.9	Your work lacks skill!”
ISA.45.10	 Danger awaits one who says
ISA.45.10	“What in the world
ISA.45.10	and to his mother,
ISA.45.10	“What in the world are you bringing forth?”
ISA.45.11	 This is what the 
ISA.45.11	the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.45.11	concerning things to come:
ISA.45.11	“How dare you question me
ISA.45.11	How dare you tell me what to do with
ISA.45.12	 I made the earth,
ISA.45.12	I created the people who live
ISA.45.12	It was me – my hands
ISA.45.12	I give orders to all the heavenly lights.
ISA.45.13	 It is me – I stir him up and commission him;
ISA.45.13	I will make all his ways level.
ISA.45.13	He will rebuild my city;
ISA.45.13	he will send my exiled people home,
ISA.45.13	but not for a price or a bribe,”
ISA.45.13	says the 
ISA.45.14	 This is what the 
ISA.45.14	“The profit
ISA.45.14	along with the Sabeans, those tall men,
ISA.45.14	will be brought to you
ISA.45.14	They will walk behind you, coming along in chains.
ISA.45.14	They will bow down to you
ISA.45.14	and pray to you:
ISA.45.14	‘Truly God is with
ISA.45.14	there is no other God!’”
ISA.45.15	 Yes, you are a God who keeps hidden,
ISA.45.15	O God of Israel, deliverer!
ISA.45.16	 They will all be ashamed and embarrassed;
ISA.45.16	those who fashion idols will all be humiliated.
ISA.45.17	 Israel will be delivered once and for all by the 
ISA.45.17	you will never again be ashamed or humiliated.
ISA.45.18	 For this is what the 
ISA.45.18	the one who created the sky – 
ISA.45.18	he is the true God,
ISA.45.18	the one who formed the earth and made it;
ISA.45.18	he established it,
ISA.45.18	he did not create it without order,
ISA.45.18	he formed it to be inhabited – 
ISA.45.18	“I am the 
ISA.45.19	 I have not spoken in secret,
ISA.45.19	in some hidden place.
ISA.45.19	I did not tell Jacob’s descendants,
ISA.45.19	‘Seek me in vain!’
ISA.45.19	I am the 
ISA.45.19	the one who speaks honestly,
ISA.45.19	who makes reliable announcements.
ISA.45.20	 Gather together and come!
ISA.45.20	Approach together, you refugees from the nations!
ISA.45.20	Those who carry wooden idols know nothing,
ISA.45.20	those who pray to a god that cannot deliver.
ISA.45.21	 Tell me! Present the evidence!
ISA.45.21	Let them consult with one another!
ISA.45.21	Who predicted this in the past?
ISA.45.21	Who announced it beforehand?
ISA.45.21	Was it not I, the 
ISA.45.21	I have no peer, there is no God but me,
ISA.45.21	a God who vindicates and delivers;
ISA.45.21	there is none but me.
ISA.45.22	 Turn to me so you can be delivered,
ISA.45.22	all you who live in the earth’s remote regions!
ISA.45.22	For I am God, and I have no peer.
ISA.45.23	 I solemnly make this oath
ISA.45.23	what I say is true and reliable:
ISA.45.23	‘Surely every knee will bow to me,
ISA.45.23	every tongue will solemnly affirm;
ISA.45.24	 they will say about me,
ISA.45.24	“Yes, the 
ISA.45.24	All who are angry at him will cower before him.
ISA.45.25	 All the descendants of Israel will be vindicated by the 
ISA.45.25	and will boast in him.
ISA.46.1	 Bel
ISA.46.1	Nebo
ISA.46.1	Their images weigh down animals and beasts.
ISA.46.1	Your heavy images are burdensome to tired animals.
ISA.46.2	 Together they bend low and kneel down;
ISA.46.2	they are unable to rescue the images;
ISA.46.2	they themselves
ISA.46.3	 “Listen to me, O family of Jacob,
ISA.46.3	all you who are left from the family of Israel,
ISA.46.3	you who have been carried from birth,
ISA.46.3	you who have been supported from the time you left the womb.
ISA.46.4	 Even when you are old, I will take care of you,
ISA.46.4	even when you have gray hair, I will carry you.
ISA.46.4	I made you and I will support you;
ISA.46.4	I will carry you and rescue you.
ISA.46.5	 To whom can you compare and liken me?
ISA.46.5	Tell me whom you think I resemble, so we can be compared!
ISA.46.6	 Those who empty out gold from a purse
ISA.46.6	and weigh out silver on the scale
ISA.46.6	hire a metalsmith, who makes it into a god.
ISA.46.6	They then bow down and worship it.
ISA.46.7	 They put it on their shoulder and carry it;
ISA.46.7	they put it in its place and it just stands there;
ISA.46.7	it does not
ISA.46.7	Even when someone cries out to it, it does not reply;
ISA.46.7	it does not deliver him from his distress.
ISA.46.8	 Remember this, so you can be brave!
ISA.46.8	Think about it, you rebels!
ISA.46.9	 Remember what I accomplished in antiquity!
ISA.46.9	Truly I am God, I have no peer;
ISA.46.9	I am God, and there is none like me,
ISA.46.10	 who announces the end from the beginning
ISA.46.10	and reveals beforehand
ISA.46.10	who says, ‘My plan will be realized,
ISA.46.10	I will accomplish what I desire,’
ISA.46.11	 who summons an eagle
ISA.46.11	from a distant land, one who carries out my plan.
ISA.46.11	Yes, I have decreed,
ISA.46.11	yes, I will bring it to pass;
ISA.46.11	I have formulated a plan,
ISA.46.11	yes, I will carry it out.
ISA.46.12	 Listen to me, you stubborn people,
ISA.46.12	you who distance yourself from doing what is right.
ISA.46.13	 I am bringing my deliverance near, it is not far away;
ISA.46.13	I am bringing my salvation near,
ISA.46.13	I will save Zion;
ISA.46.13	I will adorn Israel with my splendor.”
ISA.47.1	 “Fall down! Sit in the dirt,
ISA.47.1	O virgin
ISA.47.1	Sit on the ground, not on a throne,
ISA.47.1	O daughter of the Babylonians!
ISA.47.1	Indeed,
ISA.47.2	 Pick up millstones and grind flour!
ISA.47.2	Remove your veil,
ISA.47.2	strip off your skirt,
ISA.47.2	expose your legs,
ISA.47.2	cross the streams!
ISA.47.3	 Let your private parts be exposed!
ISA.47.3	Your genitals will be on display!
ISA.47.3	I will get revenge;
ISA.47.3	I will not have pity on anyone,”
ISA.47.4	 says our protector – 
ISA.47.4	the 
ISA.47.4	the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.47.5	 “Sit silently! Go to a hiding place,
ISA.47.5	O daughter of the Babylonians!
ISA.47.5	Indeed,
ISA.47.6	 I was angry at my people;
ISA.47.6	I defiled my special possession
ISA.47.6	and handed them over to you.
ISA.47.6	You showed them no mercy;
ISA.47.6	you even placed a very heavy burden on old people.
ISA.47.7	 You said,
ISA.47.7	‘I will rule forever as permanent queen!’
ISA.47.7	You did not think about these things;
ISA.47.7	you did not consider how it would turn out.
ISA.47.8	 So now, listen to this,
ISA.47.8	O one who lives so lavishly,
ISA.47.8	who lives securely,
ISA.47.8	who says to herself,
ISA.47.8	‘I am unique! No one can compare to me!
ISA.47.8	I will never have to live as a widow;
ISA.47.8	I will never lose my children.’
ISA.47.9	 Both of these will come upon you
ISA.47.9	suddenly, in one day!
ISA.47.9	You will lose your children and be widowed.
ISA.47.9	You will be overwhelmed by these tragedies,
ISA.47.9	despite
ISA.47.9	and your numerous amulets.
ISA.47.10	 You were complacent in your evil deeds;
ISA.47.10	you thought,
ISA.47.10	Your self-professed
ISA.47.10	when you say, ‘I am unique! No one can compare to me!’
ISA.47.11	 Disaster will overtake you;
ISA.47.11	you will not know how to charm it away.
ISA.47.11	Destruction will fall on you;
ISA.47.11	you will not be able to appease it.
ISA.47.11	Calamity will strike you suddenly,
ISA.47.11	before you recognize it.
ISA.47.12	 Persist
ISA.47.12	and your many incantations,
ISA.47.12	which you have faithfully recited
ISA.47.12	Maybe you will be successful
ISA.47.12	maybe you will scare away disaster.
ISA.47.13	 You are tired out from listening to so much advice.
ISA.47.13	Let them take their stand – 
ISA.47.13	the ones who see omens in the sky,
ISA.47.13	who gaze at the stars,
ISA.47.13	who make monthly predictions – 
ISA.47.13	let them rescue you from the disaster that is about to overtake you!
ISA.47.14	 Look, they are like straw,
ISA.47.14	which the fire burns up;
ISA.47.14	they cannot rescue themselves
ISA.47.14	from the heat
ISA.47.14	There are no coals to warm them,
ISA.47.14	no firelight to enjoy.
ISA.47.15	 They will disappoint you,
ISA.47.15	those you have so faithfully dealt with since your youth.
ISA.47.15	Each strays off in his own direction,
ISA.47.15	leaving no one to rescue you.”
ISA.48.1	 Listen to this, O family of Jacob,
ISA.48.1	you who are called by the name ‘Israel,’
ISA.48.1	and are descended from Judah,
ISA.48.1	who take oaths in the name of the 
ISA.48.1	and invoke
ISA.48.1	but not in an honest and just manner.
ISA.48.2	 Indeed, they live in the holy city;
ISA.48.2	they trust in
ISA.48.2	whose name is the 
ISA.48.3	 “I announced events beforehand,
ISA.48.3	I issued the decrees and made the predictions;
ISA.48.3	suddenly I acted and they came to pass.
ISA.48.4	 I did this
ISA.48.4	Your neck muscles are like iron
ISA.48.4	and your forehead like bronze.
ISA.48.5	 I announced them to you beforehand;
ISA.48.5	before they happened, I predicted them for you,
ISA.48.5	so you could never say,
ISA.48.5	‘My image did these things,
ISA.48.5	my idol, my cast image, decreed them.’
ISA.48.6	 You have heard; now look at all the evidence!
ISA.48.6	Will you not admit that what I say is true?
ISA.48.6	From this point on I am announcing to you new events
ISA.48.6	that are previously unrevealed and you do not know about.
ISA.48.7	 Now they come into being,
ISA.48.7	before today you did not hear about them,
ISA.48.7	so you could not say,
ISA.48.7	‘Yes,
ISA.48.8	 You did not hear,
ISA.48.8	you do not know,
ISA.48.8	you were not told beforehand.
ISA.48.8	For I know that you are very deceitful;
ISA.48.8	you were labeled
ISA.48.9	 For the sake of my reputation
ISA.48.9	for the sake of my prestige
ISA.48.10	 Look, I have refined you, but not as silver;
ISA.48.10	I have purified you
ISA.48.11	 For my sake alone
ISA.48.11	for how can I allow my name to be defiled?
ISA.48.11	I will not share my glory with anyone else!
ISA.48.12	 Listen to me, O Jacob,
ISA.48.12	Israel, whom I summoned!
ISA.48.12	I am the one;
ISA.48.12	I am present at the very beginning
ISA.48.12	and at the very end.
ISA.48.13	 Yes, my hand founded the earth;
ISA.48.13	my right hand spread out the sky.
ISA.48.13	I summon them;
ISA.48.13	they stand together.
ISA.48.14	 All of you, gather together and listen!
ISA.48.14	Who among them
ISA.48.14	The 
ISA.48.14	he will exert his power against the Babylonians.
ISA.48.15	 I, I have spoken – 
ISA.48.15	yes, I have summoned him;
ISA.48.15	I lead him and he will succeed.
ISA.48.16	 Approach me! Listen to this!
ISA.48.16	From the very first I have not spoken in secret;
ISA.48.16	when it happens,
ISA.48.16	So now, the sovereign 
ISA.48.17	 This is what the 
ISA.48.17	the Holy One of Israel:
ISA.48.17	“I am the 
ISA.48.17	who teaches you how to succeed,
ISA.48.17	who leads you in the way you should go.
ISA.48.18	 If only you had obeyed my
ISA.48.18	prosperity would have flowed to you like a river,
ISA.48.18	deliverance would have come to you like the waves of the sea.
ISA.48.19	 Your descendants would have been as numerous as sand,
ISA.48.19	and your children
ISA.48.19	Their name would not have been cut off
ISA.48.19	and eliminated from my presence.
ISA.48.20	 Leave Babylon!
ISA.48.20	Flee from the Babylonians!
ISA.48.20	Announce it with a shout of joy!
ISA.48.20	Make this known!
ISA.48.20	Proclaim it throughout the earth!
ISA.48.20	Say, ‘The 
ISA.48.21	 They do not thirst as he leads them through dry regions;
ISA.48.21	he makes water flow out of a rock for them;
ISA.48.21	he splits open a rock and water flows out.’
ISA.48.22	 There will be no prosperity for the wicked,” says the 
ISA.49.1	 Listen to me, you coastlands!
ISA.49.1	Pay attention, you people who live far away!
ISA.49.1	The 
ISA.49.1	he commissioned me when my mother brought me into the world.
ISA.49.2	 He made my mouth like a sharp sword,
ISA.49.2	he hid me in the hollow of his hand;
ISA.49.2	he made me like a sharpened
ISA.49.2	he hid me in his quiver.
ISA.49.3	 He said to me, “You are my servant,
ISA.49.3	Israel, through whom I will reveal my splendor.”
ISA.49.4	 But I thought,
ISA.49.4	I have expended my energy for absolutely nothing.”
ISA.49.4	But the 
ISA.49.4	my God will reward me.
ISA.49.5	 So now the 
ISA.49.5	the one who formed me from birth
ISA.49.5	he did this
ISA.49.5	so that Israel might be gathered to him;
ISA.49.5	and I will be honored
ISA.49.5	for my God is my source of strength
ISA.49.6	 he says, “Is it too insignificant a task for you to be my servant,
ISA.49.6	to reestablish the tribes of Jacob,
ISA.49.6	and restore the remnant
ISA.49.6	I will make you a light to the nations,
ISA.49.6	so you can bring
ISA.49.7	 This is what the 
ISA.49.7	the protector
ISA.49.7	to the one who is despised
ISA.49.7	a servant of rulers:
ISA.49.7	“Kings will see and rise in respect,
ISA.49.7	princes will bow down,
ISA.49.7	because of the faithful 
ISA.49.7	the Holy One of Israel who has chosen you.”
ISA.49.8	 This is what the 
ISA.49.8	“At the time I decide to show my favor, I will respond to you;
ISA.49.8	in the day of deliverance I will help you;
ISA.49.8	I will protect you
ISA.49.8	to rebuild
ISA.49.8	and to reassign the desolate property. 
ISA.49.9	 You will say
ISA.49.9	and to those who are in dark dungeons,
ISA.49.9	They will graze beside the roads;
ISA.49.9	on all the slopes they will find pasture.
ISA.49.10	 They will not be hungry or thirsty;
ISA.49.10	the sun’s oppressive heat will not beat down on them,
ISA.49.10	for one who has compassion on them will guide them;
ISA.49.10	he will lead them to springs of water.
ISA.49.11	 I will make all my mountains into a road;
ISA.49.11	I will construct my roadways.”
ISA.49.12	 Look, they come from far away!
ISA.49.12	Look, some come from the north and west,
ISA.49.12	and others from the land of Sinim!
ISA.49.13	 Shout for joy, O sky!
ISA.49.13	Rejoice, O earth!
ISA.49.13	Let the mountains give a joyful shout!
ISA.49.13	For the 
ISA.49.13	and shows compassion to the
ISA.49.14	 “Zion said, ‘The 
ISA.49.14	the sovereign master
ISA.49.15	 Can a woman forget her baby who nurses at her breast?
ISA.49.15	Can she withhold compassion from the child she has borne?
ISA.49.15	Even if mothers
ISA.49.15	I could never forget you!
ISA.49.16	 Look, I have inscribed your name
ISA.49.16	your walls are constantly before me.
ISA.49.17	 Your children hurry back,
ISA.49.17	while those who destroyed and devastated you depart.
ISA.49.18	 Look all around you!
ISA.49.18	All of them gather to you.
ISA.49.18	As surely as I live,” says the 
ISA.49.18	“you will certainly wear all of them like jewelry;
ISA.49.18	you will put them on as if you were a bride.
ISA.49.19	 Yes, your land lies in ruins;
ISA.49.19	it is desolate and devastated.
ISA.49.19	But now you will be too small to hold your residents,
ISA.49.19	and those who devoured you will be far away.
ISA.49.20	 Yet the children born during your time of bereavement
ISA.49.20	will say within your hearing,
ISA.49.20	‘This place is too cramped for us,
ISA.49.20	make room for us so we can live here.’
ISA.49.21	 Then you will think to yourself,
ISA.49.21	‘Who bore these children for me?
ISA.49.21	I was bereaved and barren,
ISA.49.21	dismissed and divorced.
ISA.49.21	Who raised these children?
ISA.49.21	Look, I was left all alone;
ISA.49.21	where did these children come from?’”
ISA.49.22	 This is what the sovereign 
ISA.49.22	“Look I will raise my hand to the nations;
ISA.49.22	I will raise my signal flag to the peoples.
ISA.49.22	They will bring your sons in their arms
ISA.49.22	and carry your daughters on their shoulders.
ISA.49.23	 Kings will be your children’s
ISA.49.23	their princesses will nurse your children.
ISA.49.23	With their faces to the ground they will bow down to you
ISA.49.23	and they will lick the dirt on
ISA.49.23	Then you will recognize that I am the 
ISA.49.23	those who wait patiently for me are not put to shame.
ISA.49.24	 Can spoils be taken from a warrior,
ISA.49.24	or captives be rescued from a conqueror?
ISA.49.25	 Indeed,” says the 
ISA.49.25	“captives will be taken from a warrior;
ISA.49.25	spoils will be rescued from a conqueror.
ISA.49.25	I will oppose your adversary
ISA.49.25	and I will rescue your children.
ISA.49.26	 I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh;
ISA.49.26	they will get drunk on their own blood, as if it were wine.
ISA.49.26	Then all humankind
ISA.49.26	I am the 
ISA.49.26	your protector,
ISA.50.1	 This is what the 
ISA.50.1	“Where is your mother’s divorce certificate
ISA.50.1	by which I divorced her?
ISA.50.1	Or to which of my creditors did I sell you?
ISA.50.1	Look, you were sold because of your sins;
ISA.50.1	because of your rebellious acts I divorced your mother.
ISA.50.2	 Why does no one challenge me when I come?
ISA.50.2	Why does no one respond when I call?
ISA.50.2	Is my hand too weak
ISA.50.2	Do I lack the power to rescue you?
ISA.50.2	Look, with a mere shout
ISA.50.2	I can turn streams into a desert,
ISA.50.2	so the fish rot away and die 
ISA.50.2	from lack of water.
ISA.50.3	 I can clothe the sky in darkness;
ISA.50.3	I can cover it with sackcloth.”
ISA.50.4	 The sovereign 
ISA.50.4	so that I know how to help the weary.
ISA.50.4	He wakes me up every morning;
ISA.50.4	he makes me alert so I can listen attentively as disciples do.
ISA.50.5	 The sovereign 
ISA.50.5	I have not rebelled,
ISA.50.5	I have not turned back.
ISA.50.6	 I offered my back to those who attacked,
ISA.50.6	my jaws to those who tore out my beard;
ISA.50.6	I did not hide my face
ISA.50.6	from insults and spitting.
ISA.50.7	 But the sovereign 
ISA.50.7	so I am not humiliated.
ISA.50.7	For that reason I am steadfastly resolved;
ISA.50.7	I know I will not be put to shame.
ISA.50.8	 The one who vindicates me is close by.
ISA.50.8	Who dares to argue with me? Let us confront each other!
ISA.50.8	Who is my accuser?
ISA.50.9	 Look, the sovereign 
ISA.50.9	Who dares to condemn me?
ISA.50.9	Look, all of them will wear out like clothes;
ISA.50.9	a moth will eat away at them.
ISA.50.10	 Who among you fears the 
ISA.50.10	Who obeys
ISA.50.10	Whoever walks in deep darkness,
ISA.50.10	without light,
ISA.50.10	should trust in the name of the 
ISA.50.10	and rely on his God. 
ISA.50.11	 Look, all of you who start a fire
ISA.50.11	and who equip yourselves with
ISA.50.11	walk
ISA.50.11	and among the flaming arrows you ignited!
ISA.50.11	This is what you will receive from me:
ISA.50.11	you will lie down in a place of pain.
ISA.51.1	 “Listen to me, you who pursue godliness,
ISA.51.1	who seek the 
ISA.51.1	Look at the rock from which you were chiseled,
ISA.51.1	at the quarry
ISA.51.2	 Look at Abraham, your father,
ISA.51.2	and Sarah, who gave you birth.
ISA.51.2	When I summoned him, he was a lone individual,
ISA.51.2	but I blessed him
ISA.51.3	 Certainly the 
ISA.51.3	he will console all her ruins.
ISA.51.3	He will make her wilderness like Eden,
ISA.51.3	her desert like the Garden of the 
ISA.51.3	Happiness and joy will be restored to
ISA.51.3	thanksgiving and the sound of music.
ISA.51.4	 Pay attention to me, my people!
ISA.51.4	Listen to me, my people!
ISA.51.4	For
ISA.51.4	I will make my justice a light to the nations.
ISA.51.5	 I am ready to vindicate,
ISA.51.5	I am ready to deliver,
ISA.51.5	I will establish justice among the nations.
ISA.51.5	The coastlands
ISA.51.5	they wait in anticipation for the revelation of my power.
ISA.51.6	 Look up at the sky!
ISA.51.6	Look at the earth below!
ISA.51.6	For the sky will dissipate
ISA.51.6	and the earth will wear out like clothes;
ISA.51.6	its residents will die like gnats.
ISA.51.6	But the deliverance I give
ISA.51.6	the vindication I provide
ISA.51.7	 Listen to me, you who know what is right,
ISA.51.7	you people who are aware of my law!
ISA.51.7	Don’t be afraid of the insults of men;
ISA.51.7	don’t be discouraged because of their abuse!
ISA.51.8	 For a moth will eat away at them like clothes;
ISA.51.8	a clothes moth will devour them like wool.
ISA.51.8	But the vindication I provide
ISA.51.8	the deliverance I give will last.”
ISA.51.9	 Wake up! Wake up!
ISA.51.9	Clothe yourself with strength, O arm of the 
ISA.51.9	Wake up as in former times, as in antiquity!
ISA.51.9	Did you not smash
ISA.51.9	Did you not
ISA.51.10	 Did you not dry up the sea,
ISA.51.10	the waters of the great deep?
ISA.51.10	Did you not make
ISA.51.10	so those delivered from bondage
ISA.51.11	 Those whom the 
ISA.51.11	they will enter Zion with a happy shout.
ISA.51.11	Unending joy will crown them,
ISA.51.11	happiness and joy will overwhelm
ISA.51.11	grief and suffering will disappear.
ISA.51.12	 “I, I am the one who consoles you.
ISA.51.12	Why are you afraid of mortal men,
ISA.51.12	of mere human beings who are as short-lived as grass?
ISA.51.13	 Why do you forget
ISA.51.13	who stretched out the sky
ISA.51.13	and founded the earth?
ISA.51.13	Why do you constantly tremble all day long
ISA.51.13	at the anger of the oppressor,
ISA.51.13	when he makes plans to destroy?
ISA.51.13	Where is the anger of the oppressor?
ISA.51.14	 The one who suffers
ISA.51.14	he will not die in prison,
ISA.51.14	he will not go hungry.
ISA.51.15	 I am the 
ISA.51.15	who churns up the sea so that its waves surge.
ISA.51.15	The 
ISA.51.16	 I commission you
ISA.51.16	I cover you with the palm of my hand,
ISA.51.16	to establish
ISA.51.16	to say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’”
ISA.51.17	 Wake up! Wake up!
ISA.51.17	Get up, O Jerusalem!
ISA.51.17	You drank from the cup the 
ISA.51.17	which was full of his anger!
ISA.51.17	You drained dry
ISA.51.17	the goblet full of intoxicating wine.
ISA.51.18	 There was no one to lead her
ISA.51.18	among all the children she bore;
ISA.51.18	there was no one to take her by the hand
ISA.51.18	among all the children she raised.
ISA.51.19	 These double disasters confronted you.
ISA.51.19	But who feels sorry for you?
ISA.51.19	Destruction and devastation,
ISA.51.19	famine and sword.
ISA.51.19	But who consoles you?
ISA.51.20	 Your children faint;
ISA.51.20	they lie at the head of every street
ISA.51.20	like an antelope in a snare.
ISA.51.20	They are left in a stupor by the 
ISA.51.20	by the battle cry of your God.
ISA.51.21	 So listen to this, oppressed one,
ISA.51.21	who is drunk, but not from wine!
ISA.51.22	 This is what your sovereign master,
ISA.51.22	“Look, I have removed from your hand
ISA.51.22	the cup of intoxicating wine,
ISA.51.22	the goblet full of my anger.
ISA.51.22	You will no longer have to drink it.
ISA.51.23	 I will put it into the hand of your tormentors
ISA.51.23	who said to you, ‘Lie down, so we can walk over you.’
ISA.51.23	You made your back like the ground,
ISA.51.23	and like the street for those who walked over you.”
ISA.52.1	 Wake up! Wake up!
ISA.52.1	Clothe yourself with strength, O Zion!
ISA.52.1	Put on your beautiful clothes,
ISA.52.1	O Jerusalem,
ISA.52.1	For uncircumcised and unclean pagans
ISA.52.1	will no longer invade you.
ISA.52.2	 Shake off the dirt!
ISA.52.2	Get up, captive
ISA.52.2	Take off the iron chains around your neck,
ISA.52.2	O captive daughter Zion!
ISA.52.3	 For this is what the 
ISA.52.3	“You were sold for nothing,
ISA.52.3	and you will not be redeemed for money.”
ISA.52.4	 For this is what the sovereign 
ISA.52.4	“In the beginning my people went to live temporarily in Egypt;
ISA.52.4	Assyria oppressed them for no good reason.
ISA.52.5	 And now, what do we have here?”
ISA.52.5	“Indeed my people have been carried away for nothing,
ISA.52.5	those who rule over them taunt,”
ISA.52.5	“and my name is constantly slandered
ISA.52.6	 For this reason my people will know my name,
ISA.52.6	for this reason they will know
ISA.52.6	‘Here I am.’”
ISA.52.7	 How delightful it is to see approaching over the mountains
ISA.52.7	the feet of a messenger who announces peace,
ISA.52.7	a messenger who brings good news, who announces deliverance,
ISA.52.7	who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”
ISA.52.8	 Listen,
ISA.52.8	in unison they shout for joy,
ISA.52.8	for they see with their very own eyes
ISA.52.8	the 
ISA.52.9	 In unison give a joyful shout,
ISA.52.9	O ruins of Jerusalem!
ISA.52.9	For the 
ISA.52.9	he protects
ISA.52.10	 The 
ISA.52.10	in the sight of all the nations;
ISA.52.10	the entire
ISA.52.10	our God deliver.
ISA.52.11	 Leave! Leave! Get out of there!
ISA.52.11	Don’t touch anything unclean!
ISA.52.11	Get out of it! 
ISA.52.11	Stay pure, you who carry the 
ISA.52.12	 Yet do not depart quickly
ISA.52.12	or leave in a panic.
ISA.52.12	For the 
ISA.52.12	the God of Israel is your rear guard.
ISA.52.13	 “Look, my servant will succeed!
ISA.52.13	He will be elevated, lifted high, and greatly exalted
ISA.52.14	 (just as many were horrified by the sight of you)
ISA.52.14	he was so disfigured
ISA.52.15	 his form was so marred he no longer looked human
ISA.52.15	so now
ISA.52.15	Kings will be shocked by his exaltation,
ISA.52.15	for they will witness something unannounced to them,
ISA.52.15	and they will understand something they had not heard about.
ISA.53.1	 Who would have believed
ISA.53.1	When
ISA.53.2	 He sprouted up like a twig before God,
ISA.53.2	like a root out of parched soil;
ISA.53.2	he had no stately form or majesty that might catch our attention,
ISA.53.2	no special appearance that we should want to follow him.
ISA.53.3	 He was despised and rejected by people,
ISA.53.3	one who experienced pain and was acquainted with illness;
ISA.53.3	people hid their faces from him;
ISA.53.3	he was despised, and we considered him insignificant.
ISA.53.4	 But he lifted up our illnesses,
ISA.53.4	he carried our pain;
ISA.53.4	even though we thought he was being punished,
ISA.53.4	attacked by God, and afflicted for something he had done.
ISA.53.5	 He was wounded because of
ISA.53.5	crushed because of our sins;
ISA.53.5	he endured punishment that made us well;
ISA.53.5	because of his wounds we have been healed.
ISA.53.6	 All of us had wandered off like sheep;
ISA.53.6	each of us had strayed off on his own path,
ISA.53.6	but the 
ISA.53.7	 He was treated harshly and afflicted,
ISA.53.7	but he did not even open his mouth.
ISA.53.7	Like a lamb led to the slaughtering block,
ISA.53.7	like a sheep silent before her shearers,
ISA.53.7	he did not even open his mouth.
ISA.53.8	 He was led away after an unjust trial
ISA.53.8	but who even cared?
ISA.53.8	Indeed, he was cut off from the land of the living;
ISA.53.8	because of the rebellion of his own
ISA.53.9	 They intended to bury him with criminals,
ISA.53.9	but he ended up in a rich man’s tomb,
ISA.53.9	because
ISA.53.9	nor had he spoken deceitfully.
ISA.53.10	 Though the 
ISA.53.10	once restitution is made,
ISA.53.10	he will see descendants and enjoy long life,
ISA.53.10	and the 
ISA.53.11	 Having suffered, he will reflect on his work,
ISA.53.11	he will be satisfied when he understands what he has done.
ISA.53.11	“My servant
ISA.53.11	for he carried their sins.
ISA.53.12	 So I will assign him a portion with the multitudes,
ISA.53.12	he will divide the spoils of victory with the powerful,
ISA.53.12	because he willingly submitted
ISA.53.12	and was numbered with the rebels,
ISA.53.12	when he lifted up the sin of many
ISA.53.12	and intervened
ISA.54.1	 “Shout for joy, O barren one who has not given birth!
ISA.54.1	Give a joyful shout and cry out, you who have not been in labor!
ISA.54.1	For the children of the desolate one are more numerous
ISA.54.1	than the children of the married woman,” says the 
ISA.54.2	 Make your tent larger,
ISA.54.2	stretch your tent curtains farther out!
ISA.54.2	Spare no effort,
ISA.54.2	lengthen your ropes,
ISA.54.2	and pound your stakes deep.
ISA.54.3	 For you will spread out to the right and to the left;
ISA.54.3	your children will conquer
ISA.54.3	and will resettle desolate cities.
ISA.54.4	 Don’t be afraid, for you will not be put to shame!
ISA.54.4	Don’t be intimidated,
ISA.54.4	You will forget about the shame you experienced in your youth;
ISA.54.4	you will no longer remember the disgrace of your abandonment.
ISA.54.5	 For your husband is the one who made you – 
ISA.54.5	the 
ISA.54.5	He is your protector,
ISA.54.5	He is called “God of the entire earth.”
ISA.54.6	 “Indeed, the 
ISA.54.6	like a wife who has been abandoned and suffers from depression,
ISA.54.6	like a young wife when she has been rejected,” says your God.
ISA.54.7	 “For a short time I abandoned
ISA.54.7	but with great compassion I will gather you.
ISA.54.8	 In a burst
ISA.54.8	but with lasting devotion I will have compassion on you,”
ISA.54.8	says your protector,
ISA.54.9	 “As far as I am concerned, this is like in Noah’s time,
ISA.54.9	when I vowed that the waters of Noah’s flood
ISA.54.9	In the same way I have vowed that I will not be angry at you or shout at you.
ISA.54.10	 Even if the mountains are removed
ISA.54.10	and the hills displaced,
ISA.54.10	my devotion will not be removed from you,
ISA.54.10	nor will my covenant of friendship
ISA.54.10	says the 
ISA.54.11	 “O afflicted one, driven away,
ISA.54.11	Look, I am about to set your stones in antimony
ISA.54.11	and I lay your foundation with lapis-lazuli.
ISA.54.12	 I will make your pinnacles out of gems,
ISA.54.12	your gates out of beryl,
ISA.54.12	and your outer wall
ISA.54.13	 All your children will be followers of the 
ISA.54.13	and your children will enjoy great prosperity.
ISA.54.14	 You will be reestablished when I vindicate you.
ISA.54.14	You will not experience oppression;
ISA.54.14	indeed, you will not be afraid.
ISA.54.14	You will not be terrified,
ISA.54.14	for nothing frightening
ISA.54.15	 If anyone dares to
ISA.54.15	Whoever tries to challenge you will be defeated.
ISA.54.16	 Look, I create the craftsman,
ISA.54.16	who fans the coals into a fire
ISA.54.16	and forges a weapon.
ISA.54.16	I create the destroyer so he might devastate.
ISA.54.17	 No weapon forged to be used against you will succeed;
ISA.54.17	you will refute everyone who tries to accuse you.
ISA.54.17	This is what the 
ISA.54.17	I will vindicate them,”
ISA.54.17	says the 
ISA.55.1	 “Hey,
ISA.55.1	You who have no money, come! 
ISA.55.1	Buy and eat!
ISA.55.1	Come! Buy wine and milk
ISA.55.1	without money and without cost!
ISA.55.2	 Why pay money for something that will not nourish you?
ISA.55.2	Why spend
ISA.55.2	Listen carefully
ISA.55.2	Enjoy fine food!
ISA.55.3	 Pay attention and come to me!
ISA.55.3	Listen, so you can live!
ISA.55.3	Then I will make an unconditional covenantal promise to
ISA.55.3	just like the reliable covenantal promises I made to David.
ISA.55.4	 Look, I made him a witness to nations,
ISA.55.4	a ruler and commander of nations.”
ISA.55.5	 Look, you will summon nations
ISA.55.5	nations
ISA.55.5	because of the 
ISA.55.5	the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.55.5	for he bestows honor on you.
ISA.55.6	 Seek the 
ISA.55.6	call to him while he is nearby!
ISA.55.7	 The wicked need to abandon their lifestyle
ISA.55.7	and sinful people their plans.
ISA.55.7	They should return
ISA.55.7	and to their God, for he will freely forgive them.
ISA.55.8	 “Indeed,
ISA.55.8	and my deeds
ISA.55.9	 for just as the sky
ISA.55.9	so my deeds
ISA.55.9	and my plans
ISA.55.10	 The rain and snow fall from the sky
ISA.55.10	and do not return,
ISA.55.10	but instead water the earth
ISA.55.10	and make it produce and yield crops,
ISA.55.10	and provide seed for the planter and food for those who must eat.
ISA.55.11	 In the same way, the promise that I make
ISA.55.11	does not return to me, having accomplished nothing.
ISA.55.11	No, it is realized as I desire
ISA.55.11	and is fulfilled as I intend.”
ISA.55.12	 Indeed you will go out with joy;
ISA.55.12	you will be led along in peace;
ISA.55.12	the mountains and hills will give a joyful shout before you,
ISA.55.12	and all the trees in the field will clap their hands.
ISA.55.13	 Evergreens will grow in place of thorn bushes,
ISA.55.13	firs will grow in place of nettles;
ISA.55.13	they will be a monument to the 
ISA.55.13	a permanent reminder that will remain.
ISA.56.1	 This is what the 
ISA.56.1	“Promote
ISA.56.1	For I am ready to deliver you;
ISA.56.1	I am ready to vindicate you openly.
ISA.56.2	 The people who do this will be blessed,
ISA.56.2	the people who commit themselves to obedience,
ISA.56.2	who observe the Sabbath and do not defile it,
ISA.56.2	who refrain from doing anything that is wrong.
ISA.56.3	 No foreigner who becomes a follower of
ISA.56.3	‘The 
ISA.56.3	The eunuch should not say,
ISA.56.3	‘Look, I am like a dried-up tree.’”
ISA.56.4	 For this is what the 
ISA.56.4	“For the eunuchs who observe my Sabbaths
ISA.56.4	and choose what pleases me
ISA.56.4	and are faithful to
ISA.56.5	 I will set up within my temple and my walls a monument
ISA.56.5	that will be better than sons and daughters.
ISA.56.5	I will set up a permanent monument
ISA.56.6	 As for foreigners who become followers of
ISA.56.6	who love the name of the 
ISA.56.6	all who observe the Sabbath and do not defile it,
ISA.56.6	and who are faithful to
ISA.56.7	 I will bring them to my holy mountain;
ISA.56.7	I will make them happy in the temple where people pray to me.
ISA.56.7	Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar,
ISA.56.7	for my temple will be known as a temple where all nations may pray.”
ISA.56.8	 The sovereign 
ISA.56.8	the one who gathers the dispersed of Israel:
ISA.56.8	“I will still gather them up.”
ISA.56.9	 All you wild animals in the fields, come and devour,
ISA.56.9	all you wild animals in the forest!
ISA.56.10	 All their watchmen
ISA.56.10	they are unaware.
ISA.56.10	All of them are like mute dogs,
ISA.56.10	unable to bark.
ISA.56.10	They pant,
ISA.56.10	and love to snooze.
ISA.56.11	 The dogs have big appetites;
ISA.56.11	they are never full.
ISA.56.11	They are shepherds who have no understanding;
ISA.56.11	they all go their own way,
ISA.56.11	each one looking for monetary gain.
ISA.56.12	 Each one says,
ISA.56.12	‘Come on, I’ll get some wine!
ISA.56.12	Let’s guzzle some beer!
ISA.56.12	Tomorrow will be just like today!
ISA.56.12	We’ll have everything we want!’
ISA.57.1	 The godly
ISA.57.1	but no one cares.
ISA.57.1	Honest people disappear,
ISA.57.1	when no one
ISA.57.1	that the godly
ISA.57.2	 Those who live uprightly enter a place of peace;
ISA.57.2	they rest on their beds.
ISA.57.3	 But approach, you sons of omen readers,
ISA.57.3	you offspring of adulteresses and prostitutes!
ISA.57.4	 At whom are you laughing?
ISA.57.4	At whom are you opening your mouth
ISA.57.4	and sticking out your tongue?
ISA.57.4	You are the children of rebels,
ISA.57.4	the offspring of liars,
ISA.57.5	 you who practice ritual sex
ISA.57.5	who slaughter children near the streams under the rocky overhangs.
ISA.57.6	 Among the smooth stones of the stream are the idols you love;
ISA.57.6	they, they are the object of your devotion.
ISA.57.6	You pour out liquid offerings to them,
ISA.57.6	you make an offering.
ISA.57.6	Because of these things I will seek vengeance.
ISA.57.7	 On every high, elevated hill you prepare your bed;
ISA.57.7	you go up there to offer sacrifices.
ISA.57.8	 Behind the door and doorpost you put your symbols.
ISA.57.8	Indeed,
ISA.57.8	and invite them into bed with you.
ISA.57.8	You purchase favors from them,
ISA.57.8	you love their bed,
ISA.57.8	and gaze longingly
ISA.57.9	 You take olive oil as tribute
ISA.57.9	along with many perfumes.
ISA.57.9	You send your messengers to a distant place;
ISA.57.9	you go all the way to Sheol.
ISA.57.10	 Because of the long distance you must travel, you get tired,
ISA.57.10	but you do not say, ‘I give up.’
ISA.57.10	You get renewed energy,
ISA.57.10	so you don’t collapse.
ISA.57.11	 Whom are you worried about?
ISA.57.11	Whom do you fear, that you would act so deceitfully
ISA.57.11	and not remember me
ISA.57.11	or think about me?
ISA.57.11	Because I have been silent for so long,
ISA.57.11	you are not afraid of me.
ISA.57.12	 I will denounce your so-called righteousness and your deeds,
ISA.57.12	but they will not help you.
ISA.57.13	 When you cry out for help, let your idols
ISA.57.13	The wind blows them all away,
ISA.57.13	a breeze carries them away.
ISA.57.13	But the one who looks to me for help
ISA.57.13	and will have access to
ISA.57.14	 He says,
ISA.57.14	“Build it! Build it! Clear a way!
ISA.57.14	Remove all the obstacles out of the way of my people!”
ISA.57.15	 For this is what the high and exalted one says,
ISA.57.15	the one who rules
ISA.57.15	“I dwell in an exalted and holy place,
ISA.57.15	but also with the discouraged and humiliated,
ISA.57.15	in order to cheer up the humiliated
ISA.57.15	and to encourage the discouraged.
ISA.57.16	 For I will not be hostile
ISA.57.16	or perpetually angry,
ISA.57.16	for then man’s spirit would grow faint before me,
ISA.57.16	the life-giving breath I created.
ISA.57.17	 I was angry because of their sinful greed;
ISA.57.17	I attacked them and angrily rejected them,
ISA.57.17	yet they remained disobedient and stubborn.
ISA.57.18	 I have seen their behavior,
ISA.57.18	but I will heal them and give them rest,
ISA.57.18	and I will once again console those who mourn.
ISA.57.19	 I am the one who gives them reason to celebrate.
ISA.57.19	Complete prosperity
ISA.57.19	says the 
ISA.57.20	 But the wicked are like a surging sea
ISA.57.20	 that is unable to be quiet;
ISA.57.20	its waves toss up mud and sand.
ISA.57.21	 There will be no prosperity,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
ISA.58.1	 “Shout loudly! Don’t be quiet!
ISA.58.1	Yell as loud as a trumpet!
ISA.58.1	Confront my people with their rebellious deeds;
ISA.58.1	confront Jacob’s family with their sin!
ISA.58.2	 They seek me day after day;
ISA.58.2	they want to know my requirements,
ISA.58.2	like a nation that does what is right
ISA.58.2	and does not reject the law of their God.
ISA.58.2	They ask me for just decrees;
ISA.58.2	they want to be near God.
ISA.58.3	 They lament,
ISA.58.3	Why don’t you pay attention when we humble ourselves?’
ISA.58.3	Look, at the same time you fast, you satisfy your selfish desires,
ISA.58.3	you oppress your workers.
ISA.58.4	 Look, your fasting is accompanied by
ISA.58.4	and fistfights.
ISA.58.4	Do not fast as you do today,
ISA.58.4	trying to make your voice heard in heaven.
ISA.58.5	 Is this really the kind of fasting I want?
ISA.58.5	Do I want a day when people merely humble themselves,
ISA.58.5	bowing their heads like a reed
ISA.58.5	and stretching out
ISA.58.5	Is this really what you call a fast,
ISA.58.5	a day that is pleasing to the 
ISA.58.6	 No, this is the kind of fast I want.
ISA.58.6	I want you
ISA.58.6	to tear away the ropes of the burdensome yoke,
ISA.58.6	to set free the oppressed,
ISA.58.6	and to break every burdensome yoke.
ISA.58.7	 I want you
ISA.58.7	and to provide shelter for homeless, oppressed people.
ISA.58.7	When you see someone naked, clothe him!
ISA.58.7	Don’t turn your back on your own flesh and blood!
ISA.58.8	 Then your light will shine like the sunrise;
ISA.58.8	your restoration will quickly arrive;
ISA.58.8	your godly behavior
ISA.58.8	and the 
ISA.58.9	 Then you will call out, and the 
ISA.58.9	you will cry out, and he will reply, ‘Here I am.’
ISA.58.9	You must
ISA.58.9	and stop pointing fingers and speaking sinfully.
ISA.58.10	 You must
ISA.58.10	and feed the oppressed.
ISA.58.10	Then your light will dispel the darkness,
ISA.58.10	and your darkness will be transformed into noonday.
ISA.58.11	 The 
ISA.58.11	he will feed you even in parched regions.
ISA.58.11	He will give you renewed strength,
ISA.58.11	and you will be like a well-watered garden,
ISA.58.11	like a spring that continually produces water.
ISA.58.12	 Your perpetual ruins will be rebuilt;
ISA.58.12	you will reestablish the ancient foundations.
ISA.58.12	You will be called, ‘The one who repairs broken walls,
ISA.58.12	the one who makes the streets inhabitable again.’
ISA.58.13	 You must
ISA.58.13	rather than doing anything you please on my holy day.
ISA.58.13	You must look forward to the Sabbath
ISA.58.13	and treat the 
ISA.58.13	You must treat it with respect by refraining from your normal activities,
ISA.58.13	and by refraining from your selfish pursuits and from making business deals.
ISA.58.14	 Then you will find joy in your relationship to the 
ISA.58.14	and I will give you great prosperity,
ISA.58.14	and cause crops to grow on the land I gave to your ancestor Jacob.”
ISA.58.14	Know for certain that the 
ISA.59.1	 Look, the 
ISA.59.1	his ear is not too deaf to hear you.
ISA.59.2	 But your sinful acts have alienated you from your God;
ISA.59.2	your sins have caused him to reject you and not listen to your prayers.
ISA.59.3	 For your hands are stained with blood
ISA.59.3	and your fingers with sin;
ISA.59.3	your lips speak lies,
ISA.59.3	your tongue utters malicious words.
ISA.59.4	 No one is concerned about justice;
ISA.59.4	no one sets forth his case truthfully.
ISA.59.4	They depend on false words
ISA.59.4	they conceive of oppression
ISA.59.4	and give birth to sin.
ISA.59.5	 They hatch the eggs of a poisonous snake
ISA.59.5	and spin a spider’s web.
ISA.59.5	Whoever eats their eggs will die,
ISA.59.5	a poisonous snake is hatched.
ISA.59.6	 Their webs cannot be used for clothing;
ISA.59.6	they cannot cover themselves with what they make.
ISA.59.6	Their deeds are sinful;
ISA.59.6	they commit violent crimes.
ISA.59.7	 They are eager to do evil,
ISA.59.7	quick to shed innocent blood.
ISA.59.7	Their thoughts are sinful;
ISA.59.7	they crush and destroy.
ISA.59.8	 They are unfamiliar with peace;
ISA.59.8	their deeds are unjust.
ISA.59.8	They use deceitful methods,
ISA.59.8	and whoever deals with them is unfamiliar with peace.
ISA.59.9	 For this reason deliverance
ISA.59.9	and salvation does not reach us.
ISA.59.9	We wait for light,
ISA.59.9	we wait for
ISA.59.10	 We grope along the wall like the blind,
ISA.59.10	we grope like those who cannot see;
ISA.59.10	we stumble at noontime as if it were evening.
ISA.59.10	Though others are strong, we are like dead men.
ISA.59.11	 We all growl like bears,
ISA.59.11	we coo mournfully like doves;
ISA.59.11	we wait for deliverance,
ISA.59.11	for salvation, but it is far from us.
ISA.59.12	 For you are aware of our many rebellious deeds,
ISA.59.12	and our sins testify against us;
ISA.59.12	indeed, we are aware of our rebellious deeds;
ISA.59.12	we know our sins all too well.
ISA.59.13	 We have rebelled and tried to deceive the 
ISA.59.13	we turned back from following our God.
ISA.59.13	We stir up
ISA.59.13	we tell lies we concocted in our minds.
ISA.59.14	 Justice is driven back;
ISA.59.14	godliness
ISA.59.14	Indeed,
ISA.59.14	and morality is not even able to enter.
ISA.59.15	 Honesty has disappeared;
ISA.59.15	the one who tries to avoid evil is robbed.
ISA.59.15	The 
ISA.59.15	for there is no justice.
ISA.59.16	 He sees there is no advocate;
ISA.59.16	he is shocked
ISA.59.16	So he takes matters into his own hands;
ISA.59.16	his desire for justice drives him on.
ISA.59.17	 He wears his desire for justice
ISA.59.17	and his desire to deliver is like a helmet on his head.
ISA.59.17	He puts on the garments of vengeance
ISA.59.17	and wears zeal like a robe.
ISA.59.18	 He repays them for what they have done,
ISA.59.18	dispensing angry judgment to his adversaries
ISA.59.18	and punishing his enemies.
ISA.59.18	He repays the coastlands.
ISA.59.19	 In the west, people respect
ISA.59.19	in the east they recognize his splendor.
ISA.59.19	For he comes like a rushing

ISA.62.4	For the 
ISA.62.4	and your land will be married to him.
ISA.62.5	 As a young man marries a young woman,

ISA.62.10	 Come through! Come through the gates!
ISA.62.10	Prepare the way for the people!
ISA.62.10	Build it! Build the roadway!

ISA.62.11	‘Look, your deliverer comes!
ISA.62.11	Look, his reward is with him
ISA.62.11	and his reward goes before him!’”
ISA.62.12	 They will be called, “The Holy People,
ISA.62.12	the Ones Protected
ISA.62.12	You will be called, “Sought After,
ISA.62.12	City Not Abandoned.”
ISA.63.1	 Who is this who comes from Edom,
ISA.63.1	dressed in bright red, coming from Bozrah?
ISA.63.1	Who
ISA.63.1	who marches confidently
ISA.63.1	“It is I, the one who announces vindication,
ISA.63.1	and who is able to deliver!”
ISA.63.2	 Why are your clothes red?
ISA.63.2	Why do you look like someone who has stomped on grapes in a vat?
ISA.63.3	 “I have stomped grapes in the winepress all by myself;
ISA.63.3	no one from the nations joined me.
ISA.63.3	I stomped on them
ISA.63.3	I trampled them down in my rage.
ISA.63.3	Their juice splashed on my garments,
ISA.63.3	and stained
ISA.63.4	 For I looked forward to the day of vengeance,
ISA.63.4	and then payback time arrived.
ISA.63.5	 I looked, but there was no one to help;
ISA.63.5	I was shocked because there was no one offering support.
ISA.63.5	So my right arm accomplished deliverance;
ISA.63.5	my raging anger drove me on.
ISA.63.6	 I trampled nations in my anger,
ISA.63.6	I made them drunk
ISA.63.6	I splashed their blood on the ground.”
ISA.63.7	 I will tell of the faithful acts of the 
ISA.63.7	of the 
ISA.63.7	I will tell about all
ISA.63.7	the many good things he did for the family of Israel,
ISA.63.7	because of
ISA.63.8	 He said, “Certainly they will be my people,
ISA.63.8	children who are not disloyal.”
ISA.63.8	He became their deliverer.
ISA.63.9	 Through all that they suffered, he suffered too.
ISA.63.9	The messenger sent from his very presence
ISA.63.9	In his love and mercy he protected
ISA.63.9	he lifted them up and carried them throughout ancient times.
ISA.63.10	 But they rebelled and offended
ISA.63.10	so he turned into an enemy
ISA.63.10	and fought against them.
ISA.63.11	 His people remembered the ancient times.
ISA.63.11	Where is the one who brought them up out of the sea,
ISA.63.11	along with the shepherd of
ISA.63.11	Where is the one who placed his holy Spirit among them,
ISA.63.12	 the one who made his majestic power available to Moses,
ISA.63.12	who divided the water before them,
ISA.63.12	gaining for himself a lasting reputation,
ISA.63.13	 who led them through the deep water?
ISA.63.13	Like a horse running on flat land
ISA.63.14	 Like an animal that goes down into a valley to graze,
ISA.63.14	so the Spirit of the 
ISA.63.14	In this way
ISA.63.14	gaining for yourself an honored reputation.
ISA.63.15	 Look down from heaven and take notice,
ISA.63.15	from your holy, majestic palace!
ISA.63.15	Where are your zeal
ISA.63.15	Do not hold back your tender compassion!
ISA.63.16	 For you are our father,
ISA.63.16	though Abraham does not know us
ISA.63.16	and Israel does not recognize us.
ISA.63.16	You, 
ISA.63.16	you have been called our protector from ancient times.
ISA.63.17	 Why, 
ISA.63.17	and make our minds stubborn so that we do not obey you?
ISA.63.17	Return for the sake of your servants,
ISA.63.17	the tribes of your inheritance!
ISA.63.18	 For a short time your special
ISA.63.18	but then our adversaries knocked down
ISA.63.19	 We existed from ancient times,
ISA.63.19	but you did not rule over them,
ISA.63.19	they were not your subjects.
ISA.64.1	 If only you would tear apart the sky
ISA.64.1	The mountains would tremble
ISA.64.2	or fire makes water boil,
ISA.64.2	let your adversaries know who you are,
ISA.64.2	and may the nations shake at your presence!
ISA.64.3	 When you performed awesome deeds that took us by surprise,
ISA.64.3	you came down, and the mountains trembled
ISA.64.4	 Since ancient times no one has heard or perceived,
ISA.64.4	no eye has seen any God besides you,
ISA.64.4	who intervenes for those who wait for him.
ISA.64.5	 You assist
ISA.64.5	who observe your commandments.
ISA.64.5	Look, you were angry because we violated them continually. 
ISA.64.5	How then can we be saved?
ISA.64.6	 We are all like one who is unclean,
ISA.64.6	all our so-called righteous acts are like a menstrual rag in your sight.
ISA.64.6	We all wither like a leaf;
ISA.64.6	our sins carry us away like the wind.
ISA.64.7	 No one invokes
ISA.64.7	or makes an effort
ISA.64.7	For you have rejected us
ISA.64.7	and handed us over to our own sins.
ISA.64.8	 Yet,
ISA.64.8	We are the clay, and you are our potter;
ISA.64.8	we are all the product of your labor.
ISA.64.9	Do not hold our sins against us continually!
ISA.64.9	Take a good look at your people, at all of us!
ISA.64.10	 Your chosen
ISA.64.10	Zion has become a desert,
ISA.64.10	Jerusalem
ISA.64.11	 Our holy temple, our pride and joy,
ISA.64.11	the place where our ancestors praised you,
ISA.64.11	has been burned with fire;
ISA.64.11	all our prized possessions have been destroyed.
ISA.64.12	 In light of all this,
ISA.64.12	How can you be silent and continue to humiliate us?
ISA.65.1	 “I made myself available to those who did not ask for me;
ISA.65.1	I appeared to those who did not look for me.
ISA.65.1	I said, ‘Here I am! Here I am!’
ISA.65.1	to a nation that did not invoke
ISA.65.2	 I spread out my hands all day long
ISA.65.2	to my rebellious people,
ISA.65.2	who lived in a way that is morally unacceptable,
ISA.65.2	and who did what they desired.
ISA.65.3	 These people continually and blatantly offend me
ISA.65.3	as they sacrifice in their sacred orchards
ISA.65.3	and burn incense on brick altars.
ISA.65.4	 They sit among the tombs
ISA.65.4	and keep watch all night long.
ISA.65.4	They eat pork,
ISA.65.4	and broth
ISA.65.5	 They say, ‘Keep to yourself!
ISA.65.5	Don’t get near me, for I am holier than you!’
ISA.65.5	These people are like smoke in my nostrils,
ISA.65.5	like a fire that keeps burning all day long.
ISA.65.6	 Look, I have decreed:
ISA.65.6	I will not keep silent, but will pay them back;
ISA.65.6	I will pay them back exactly what they deserve,
ISA.65.7	 for your sins and your ancestors’ sins,”
ISA.65.7	“Because they burned incense on the mountains
ISA.65.7	and offended
ISA.65.7	I will punish them in full measure.”
ISA.65.8	 This is what the 
ISA.65.8	“When
ISA.65.8	someone says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for it contains juice.’
ISA.65.8	So I will do for the sake of my servants – 
ISA.65.8	I will not destroy everyone.
ISA.65.9	 I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,
ISA.65.9	and from Judah people to take possession of my mountains.
ISA.65.9	My chosen ones will take possession of the land;
ISA.65.9	my servants will live there.
ISA.65.10	 Sharon
ISA.65.10	and the Valley of Achor
ISA.65.10	they will belong to my people, who seek me.
ISA.65.11	 But as for you who abandon the 
ISA.65.11	and forget about worshiping at
ISA.65.11	who prepare a feast for the god called ‘Fortune,’
ISA.65.11	and fill up wine jugs for the god called ‘Destiny’
ISA.65.12	 I predestine you to die by the sword,
ISA.65.12	all of you will kneel down at the slaughtering block,
ISA.65.12	because I called to you, and you did not respond,
ISA.65.12	I spoke and you did not listen.
ISA.65.12	You did evil before me;
ISA.65.12	you chose to do what displeases me.”
ISA.65.13	 So this is what the sovereign 
ISA.65.13	“Look, my servants will eat, but you will be hungry!
ISA.65.13	Look, my servants will drink, but you will be thirsty!
ISA.65.13	Look, my servants will rejoice, but you will be humiliated!
ISA.65.14	 Look, my servants will shout for joy as happiness fills their hearts!
ISA.65.14	But you will cry out as sorrow fills your hearts;
ISA.65.14	you will wail because your spirits will be crushed.
ISA.65.15	 Your names will live on in the curse formulas of my chosen ones.
ISA.65.15	The sovereign 
ISA.65.15	but he will give his servants another name.
ISA.65.16	 Whoever pronounces a blessing in the earth
ISA.65.16	will do so in the name of the faithful God;
ISA.65.16	whoever makes an oath in the earth
ISA.65.16	will do so in the name of the faithful God.
ISA.65.16	For past problems will be forgotten;
ISA.65.16	I will no longer think about them.
ISA.65.17	 For look, I am ready to create 
ISA.65.17	new heavens and a new earth!
ISA.65.17	The former ones
ISA.65.17	no one will think about them anymore.
ISA.65.18	 But be happy and rejoice forevermore
ISA.65.18	over what I am about to create!
ISA.65.18	For look, I am ready to create Jerusalem
ISA.65.18	and her people to be a source of happiness.
ISA.65.19	 Jerusalem will bring me joy,
ISA.65.19	and my people will bring me happiness.
ISA.65.19	The sound of weeping or cries of sorrow
ISA.65.19	will never be heard in her again.
ISA.65.20	 Never again will one of her infants live just a few days
ISA.65.20	or an old man die before his time.
ISA.65.20	Indeed, no one will die before the age of a hundred,
ISA.65.20	anyone who fails to reach
ISA.65.21	 They will build houses and live in them;
ISA.65.21	they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
ISA.65.22	 No longer will they build a house only to have another live in it,
ISA.65.22	or plant a vineyard only to have another eat its fruit,
ISA.65.22	for my people will live as long as trees,
ISA.65.22	and my chosen ones will enjoy to the fullest what they have produced.
ISA.65.23	 They will not work in vain,
ISA.65.23	or give birth to children that will experience disaster.
ISA.65.23	For the 
ISA.65.23	and their descendants.
ISA.65.24	 Before they even call out,
ISA.65.24	while they are still speaking, I will hear.
ISA.65.25	 A wolf and a lamb will graze together;
ISA.65.25	a lion, like an ox, will eat straw,
ISA.65.25	and a snake’s food will be dirt.
ISA.65.25	They will no longer injure or destroy
ISA.65.25	on my entire royal mountain,”
ISA.66.1	 This is what the 
ISA.66.1	“The heavens are my throne
ISA.66.1	and the earth is my footstool.
ISA.66.1	Where then is the house you will build for me?
ISA.66.1	Where is the place where I will rest?
ISA.66.2	 My hand made them;
ISA.66.2	that is how they came to be,”
ISA.66.2	I show special favor
ISA.66.2	who respect what I have to say.
ISA.66.3	 The one who slaughters a bull also strikes down a man;
ISA.66.3	the one who sacrifices a lamb also breaks a dog’s neck;
ISA.66.3	the one who presents an offering includes pig’s blood with it;
ISA.66.3	the one who offers incense also praises an idol.
ISA.66.3	They have decided to behave this way;
ISA.66.3	they enjoy these disgusting practices.
ISA.66.4	 So I will choose severe punishment
ISA.66.4	I will bring on them what they dread,
ISA.66.4	because I called, and no one responded,
ISA.66.4	I spoke and they did not listen.
ISA.66.4	They did evil before me;
ISA.66.4	they chose to do what displeases me.”
ISA.66.5	 Hear the word of the 
ISA.66.5	you who respect what he has to say!
ISA.66.5	Your countrymen,
ISA.66.5	and exclude you, supposedly for the sake of my name,
ISA.66.5	say, “May the 
ISA.66.5	then we will witness your joy.”
ISA.66.5	But they will be put to shame.
ISA.66.6	 The sound of battle comes from the city;
ISA.66.6	the sound comes from the temple!
ISA.66.6	It is the sound of the 
ISA.66.7	 Before she goes into labor, she gives birth!
ISA.66.7	Before her contractions begin, she delivers a boy!
ISA.66.8	 Who has ever heard of such a thing?
ISA.66.8	Who has ever seen this?
ISA.66.8	Can a country
ISA.66.8	Can a nation be born in a single moment?
ISA.66.8	Yet as soon as Zion goes into labor she gives birth to sons!
ISA.66.9	 “Do I bring a baby to the birth opening and then not deliver it?”
ISA.66.9	asks the 
ISA.66.9	“Or do I bring a baby to the point of delivery and then hold it back?”
ISA.66.9	asks your God.
ISA.66.10	 Be happy for Jerusalem
ISA.66.10	 and rejoice with her, all you who love her!
ISA.66.10	Share in her great joy,
ISA.66.10	all you who have mourned over her!
ISA.66.11	 For
ISA.66.11	you will feed with joy from her milk-filled breasts.
ISA.66.12	 For this is what the 
ISA.66.12	“Look, I am ready to extend to her prosperity that will flow like a river,
ISA.66.12	 the riches of nations will flow into her like a stream that floods its banks.
ISA.66.12	You will nurse from her breast
ISA.66.12	you will play on her knees.
ISA.66.13	 As a mother consoles a child,
ISA.66.13	so I will console you,
ISA.66.13	and you will be consoled over Jerusalem.”
ISA.66.14	 When you see this, you will be happy,
ISA.66.14	and you will be revived.
ISA.66.14	The 
ISA.66.14	and his anger to his enemies.
ISA.66.15	 For look, the 
ISA.66.15	his chariots come like a windstorm,
ISA.66.15	to reveal his raging anger,
ISA.66.15	his battle cry, and his flaming arrows.
ISA.66.16	 For the 
ISA.66.16	with fire and his sword;
ISA.66.16	the 
ISA.66.17	 “As for those who consecrate and ritually purify themselves so they can follow their leader and worship in the sacred orchards,
ISA.66.18	 “I hate their deeds and thoughts! So I am coming
ISA.66.19	 I will perform a mighty act among them
ISA.66.20	 They will bring back all your countrymen
ISA.66.21	 And I will choose some of them as priests and Levites,” says the 
ISA.66.22	 “For just as the new heavens and the new earth I am about to make will remain standing before me,” says the 
ISA.66.23	 From one month
ISA.66.24	 “They will go out and observe the corpses of those who rebelled against me, for the maggots that eat them will not die,
JER.1.1	 The following is a record of what Jeremiah son of Hilkiah prophesied.
JER.1.2	 The 
JER.1.3	 The 
JER.1.4	 The 
JER.1.5	 “Before I formed you in your mother’s womb
JER.1.5	Before you were born I set you apart.
JER.1.5	I appointed you to be a prophet to the nations.”
JER.1.6	 I answered, “Oh, Lord 
JER.1.7	 The 
JER.1.8	 Do not be afraid of those to whom I send you,
JER.1.9	 Then the 
JER.1.10	 Know for certain that
JER.1.11	 Later the 
JER.1.12	 Then the 
JER.1.13	 The 
JER.1.14	 Then the 
JER.1.15	 For I will soon summon all the peoples of the kingdoms of the north,” says the 
JER.1.16	 In this way
JER.1.17	 “But you, Jeremiah,
JER.1.18	 I, the 
JER.1.19	 They will attack you but they will not be able to overcome you, for I will be with you to rescue you,” says the 
JER.2.1	 The 
JER.2.2	 “Go and declare in the hearing of the people of Jerusalem:
JER.2.3	 Israel was set apart to the 
JER.2.4	 Now listen to what the Lord has to say, you descendants
JER.2.4	all you family groups from the nation
JER.2.5	 This is what the Lord says:
JER.2.5	“What fault could your ancestors
JER.2.5	that they strayed so far from me?
JER.2.5	They paid allegiance to
JER.2.6	 They did not ask:
JER.2.6	‘Where is the 
JER.2.6	who brought us through the wilderness,
JER.2.6	through a land of desert sands and rift valleys,
JER.2.6	through a land of drought and deep darkness,
JER.2.6	through a land in which no one travels,
JER.2.6	and where no one lives?’
JER.2.7	 I brought you
JER.2.7	so you could enjoy
JER.2.7	But when you entered my land, you defiled it;
JER.2.7	you made the land I call my own
JER.2.8	 Your priests
JER.2.8	Those responsible for teaching my law
JER.2.8	Your rulers rebelled against me.
JER.2.8	Your prophets prophesied in the name of the god Baal.
JER.2.8	They all worshiped idols that could not help them.
JER.2.9	 “So, once more I will state my case
JER.2.9	“I will also state it against your children and grandchildren.
JER.2.10	 Go west
JER.2.10	Send someone east to Kedar
JER.2.10	See if such a thing as this has ever happened:
JER.2.11	 Has a nation ever changed its gods
JER.2.11	(even though they are not really gods at all)?
JER.2.11	But my people have exchanged me, their glorious God,
JER.2.11	for a god that cannot help them at all!
JER.2.12	 Be amazed at this, O heavens!
JER.2.12	Be shocked and utterly dumbfounded,”
JER.2.12	says the 
JER.2.13	 “Do so because my people have committed a double wrong:
JER.2.13	they have rejected me,
JER.2.13	the fountain of life-giving water,
JER.2.13	and they have dug cisterns for themselves,
JER.2.13	cracked cisterns which cannot even hold water.”
JER.2.14	 “Israel is not a slave, is he?
JER.2.14	He was not born into slavery, was he?
JER.2.14	If not, why then is he being carried off?
JER.2.15	 Like lions his enemies roar victoriously over him;
JER.2.15	they raise their voices in triumph.
JER.2.15	They have laid his land waste;
JER.2.15	his cities have been burned down and deserted.
JER.2.16	 Even the soldiers
JER.2.16	have cracked your skulls, people of Israel.
JER.2.17	 You have brought all this on yourself, Israel,
JER.2.17	by deserting the 
JER.2.18	 What good will it do you
JER.2.18	to seek help from the Egyptians?
JER.2.18	What good will it do you
JER.2.18	to seek help from the Assyrians?
JER.2.19	 Your own wickedness will bring about your punishment.
JER.2.19	Your unfaithful acts will bring down discipline on you.
JER.2.19	Know, then, and realize how utterly harmful
JER.2.19	it was for you to reject me, the 
JER.2.19	to show no respect for me,”
JER.2.19	says the Lord 
JER.2.20	 “Indeed,
JER.2.20	and refused to be subject to me.
JER.2.20	You said, ‘I will not serve you.’
JER.2.20	Instead, you gave yourself to other gods on every high hill
JER.2.20	and under every green tree,
JER.2.20	like a prostitute sprawls out before her lovers.
JER.2.21	 I planted you in the land 
JER.2.21	like a special vine of the very best stock.
JER.2.21	Why in the world have you turned into something like a wild vine
JER.2.21	that produces rotten, foul-smelling grapes?
JER.2.22	 You can try to wash away your guilt with a strong detergent.
JER.2.22	You can use as much soap as you want.
JER.2.22	But the stain of your guilt is still there for me to see,”
JER.2.22	says the Lord 
JER.2.23	 “How can you say, ‘I have not made myself unclean.
JER.2.23	I have not paid allegiance to
JER.2.23	Just look at the way you have behaved in the Valley of Hinnom!
JER.2.23	Think about the things you have done there!
JER.2.23	You are like a flighty, young female camel
JER.2.23	that rushes here and there, crisscrossing its path.
JER.2.24	 You are like a wild female donkey brought up in the wilderness.
JER.2.24	In her lust she sniffs the wind to get the scent of a male.
JER.2.24	No one can hold her back when she is in heat.
JER.2.24	None of the males need wear themselves out chasing after her.
JER.2.24	At mating time she is easy to find.
JER.2.25	 Do not chase after other gods until your shoes wear out
JER.2.25	and your throats become dry.
JER.2.25	But you say, ‘It is useless for you to try and stop me
JER.2.25	because I love those foreign gods
JER.2.26	 Just as a thief has to suffer dishonor when he is caught,
JER.2.26	so the people of Israel
JER.2.26	So will their kings and officials,
JER.2.26	their priests and their prophets.
JER.2.27	 They say to a wooden idol,
JER.2.27	They say to a stone image, ‘You gave birth to me.’
JER.2.27	Yes, they have turned away from me instead of turning to me.
JER.2.27	Yet when they are in trouble, they say, ‘Come and save us!’
JER.2.28	 But where are the gods you made for yourselves?
JER.2.28	Let them save you when you are in trouble.
JER.2.28	The sad fact is that
JER.2.28	as you have towns, Judah.
JER.2.29	 “Why do you try to refute me?
JER.2.29	All of you have rebelled against me,”
JER.2.29	says the 
JER.2.30	 “It did no good for me to punish your people.
JER.2.30	They did not respond to such correction.
JER.2.30	You slaughtered your prophets
JER.2.30	like a voracious lion.”
JER.2.31	 You people of this generation, 
JER.2.31	listen to what the 
JER.2.31	“Have I been like a wilderness to you, Israel?
JER.2.31	Have I been like a dark and dangerous land to you?
JER.2.31	Why then do you
JER.2.31	We will not come to you any more?’
JER.2.32	 Does a young woman forget to put on her jewels?
JER.2.32	Does a bride forget to put on her bridal attire?
JER.2.32	But my people have forgotten me 
JER.2.32	for more days than can even be counted.
JER.2.33	 “My, how good you have become
JER.2.33	at chasing after your lovers!
JER.2.33	Why, you could even teach prostitutes a thing or two!
JER.2.34	 Even your clothes are stained with
JER.2.34	the lifeblood of the poor who had not done anything wrong; 
JER.2.34	you did not catch them breaking into your homes.
JER.2.34	Yet, in spite of all these things you have done,
JER.2.35	 you say, ‘I have not done anything wrong,
JER.2.35	so the 
JER.2.35	But, watch out!
JER.2.35	because you say, ‘I have not committed any sin.’
JER.2.36	 Why do you constantly go about
JER.2.36	changing your political allegiances?
JER.2.36	You will get no help from Egypt
JER.2.36	just as you got no help from Assyria.
JER.2.37	 Moreover, you will come away from Egypt
JER.2.37	with your hands covering your faces in sorrow and shame
JER.2.37	because the 
JER.2.37	and you will not gain any help from them.
JER.3.1	 “If a man divorces his wife
JER.3.1	and she leaves him and becomes another man’s wife,
JER.3.1	he may not take her back again.
JER.3.1	Doing that would utterly defile the land.
JER.3.1	But you, Israel, have given yourself as a prostitute to many gods.
JER.3.1	So what makes you think you can return to me?”
JER.3.1	says the 
JER.3.2	 “Look up at the hilltops and consider this.
JER.3.2	You have had sex with other gods on every one of them.
JER.3.2	You waited for those gods like a thief lying in wait in the desert.
JER.3.2	You defiled the land by your wicked prostitution to other gods.
JER.3.3	 That is why the rains have been withheld,
JER.3.3	and the spring rains have not come.
JER.3.3	Yet in spite of this you are obstinate as a prostitute.
JER.3.3	You refuse to be ashamed of what you have done.
JER.3.4	 Even now you say to me, ‘You are my father!
JER.3.4	You have been my faithful companion ever since I was young.
JER.3.5	 You will not always be angry with me, will you?
JER.3.5	You will not be mad at me forever, will you?’
JER.3.5	That is what you say,
JER.3.5	but you continually do all the evil that you can.”
JER.3.6	 When Josiah was king of Judah, the 
JER.3.7	 Yet even after she had done all that, I thought that she might come back to me.
JER.3.8	 She also saw
JER.3.9	 Because she took her prostitution so lightly, she defiled the land
JER.3.10	 In spite of all this,
JER.3.11	 Then the 
JER.3.12	 “Go and shout this message to my people in the countries in the north.
JER.3.12	‘Come back to me, wayward Israel,’ says the 
JER.3.12	‘I will not continue to look on you with displeasure.
JER.3.12	For I am merciful,’ says the 
JER.3.12	‘I will not be angry with you forever.
JER.3.13	 However, you must confess that you have done wrong,
JER.3.13	and that you have rebelled against the 
JER.3.13	You must confess
JER.3.13	and have not obeyed my commands,’ says the 
JER.3.14	 “Come back to me, my wayward sons,” says the 
JER.3.15	 I will give you leaders
JER.3.16	 In those days, your population will greatly increase
JER.3.17	 At that time the city of Jerusalem
JER.3.18	 At that time
JER.3.19	 “I thought to myself,
JER.3.19	‘Oh what a joy it would be for me to treat you like a son!
JER.3.19	What a joy it would be for me to give
JER.3.19	the most beautiful piece of property there is in all the world!’
JER.3.19	I thought you would call me, ‘Father’
JER.3.19	and would never cease being loyal to me.
JER.3.20	 But, you have been unfaithful to me, nation of Israel,
JER.3.20	like an unfaithful wife who has left her husband,”
JER.3.20	says the 
JER.3.21	 “A noise is heard on the hilltops.
JER.3.21	It is the sound of the people of Israel crying and pleading to their gods.
JER.3.21	Indeed they have followed sinful ways;
JER.3.21	they have forgotten to be true to the 
JER.3.22	 Come back to me, you wayward people.
JER.3.22	I want to cure your waywardness.
JER.3.22	Say,
JER.3.22	because you are the 
JER.3.23	 We know our noisy worship of false gods 
JER.3.23	on the hills and mountains did not help us.
JER.3.23	We know that the 
JER.3.23	is the only one who can deliver Israel.
JER.3.24	 From earliest times our worship of that shameful god, Baal, 
JER.3.24	has taken away
JER.3.24	It has taken away our flocks and our herds,
JER.3.24	and even our sons and daughters.
JER.3.25	 Let us acknowledge
JER.3.25	Let us bear the disgrace that we deserve.
JER.3.25	For we have sinned against the 
JER.3.25	both we and our ancestors.
JER.3.25	From earliest times to this very day
JER.3.25	we have not obeyed the 
JER.4.1	 “If you, Israel, want to come back,” says the 
JER.4.1	“if you want to come back to me
JER.4.1	you must get those disgusting idols
JER.4.1	and must no longer go astray.
JER.4.2	 You must be truthful, honest and upright
JER.4.2	when you take an oath saying, ‘As surely as the 
JER.4.2	If you do,
JER.4.2	and will make him the object of their boasting.”
JER.4.3	 Yes,
JER.4.3	to the people of Judah and Jerusalem: 
JER.4.3	“Like a farmer breaking up hard unplowed ground,
JER.4.3	you must break your rebellious will and make a new beginning;
JER.4.3	just as a farmer must clear away thorns lest the seed is wasted,
JER.4.3	you must get rid of the sin that is ruining your lives.
JER.4.4	 Just as ritual circumcision cuts away the foreskin
JER.4.4	as an external symbol of dedicated covenant commitment, 
JER.4.4	you must genuinely dedicate yourselves to the 
JER.4.4	and get rid of everything that hinders your commitment to me,
JER.4.4	people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem.
JER.4.4	If you do not,
JER.4.4	that no one will be able to extinguish.
JER.4.4	That will happen because of the evil you have done.”
JER.4.5	 The 
JER.4.5	“Announce
JER.4.5	‘Sound the trumpet
JER.4.5	Shout out loudly,
JER.4.5	‘Gather together! Let us flee into the fortified cities!’
JER.4.6	 Raise a signal flag that tells people to go to Zion.
JER.4.6	Run for safety! Do not delay!
JER.4.6	For I am about to bring disaster out of the north.
JER.4.6	It will bring great destruction.
JER.4.7	 Like a lion that has come up from its lair
JER.4.7	the one who destroys nations has set out from his home base.
JER.4.7	He is coming out to lay your land waste.
JER.4.7	Your cities will become ruins and lie uninhabited.
JER.4.8	 So put on sackcloth!
JER.4.8	Mourn and wail, saying,
JER.4.8	‘The fierce anger of the 
JER.4.8	has not turned away from us!’”
JER.4.9	 “When this happens,”
JER.4.9	“the king and his officials will lose their courage.
JER.4.9	The priests will be struck with horror,
JER.4.9	and the prophets will be speechless in astonishment.”
JER.4.10	 In response to all this
JER.4.11	 “At that time the people of Judah and Jerusalem
JER.4.11	‘A scorching wind will sweep down
JER.4.11	from the hilltops in the desert on
JER.4.11	It will not be a gentle breeze
JER.4.11	for winnowing the grain and blowing away the chaff.
JER.4.12	 No,
JER.4.12	Yes, even now I, myself, am calling down judgment on them.’
JER.4.13	 Look! The enemy is approaching like gathering clouds.
JER.4.13	The roar of his chariots is like that of a whirlwind.
JER.4.13	His horses move more swiftly than eagles.”
JER.4.13	I cry out,
JER.4.14	 “Oh people of Jerusalem, purify your hearts from evil
JER.4.14	so that you may yet be delivered.
JER.4.14	How long will you continue to harbor up
JER.4.14	wicked schemes within you?
JER.4.15	 For messengers are coming, heralding disaster,
JER.4.15	from the city of Dan and from the hills of Ephraim.
JER.4.16	 They are saying,
JER.4.16	‘Announce to the surrounding nations,
JER.4.16	“The enemy is coming!”
JER.4.16	Proclaim this message
JER.4.16	“Those who besiege cities
JER.4.16	They are ready to raise the battle cry against
JER.4.17	 They will surround Jerusalem
JER.4.17	like men guarding a field
JER.4.17	because they have rebelled against me,”
JER.4.17	says the 
JER.4.18	 “The way you have lived and the things you have done
JER.4.18	will bring this on you.
JER.4.18	This is the punishment you deserve, and it will be painful indeed.
JER.4.18	The pain will be so bad it will pierce your heart.”
JER.4.19	 I said,
JER.4.19	“Oh, the feeling in the pit of my stomach!
JER.4.19	I writhe in anguish.
JER.4.19	Oh, the pain in my heart!
JER.4.19	My heart pounds within me.
JER.4.19	I cannot keep silent.
JER.4.19	For I hear the sound of the trumpet;
JER.4.19	the sound of the battle cry pierces my soul!
JER.4.20	 I see
JER.4.20	so that the whole land lies in ruins.
JER.4.20	I see our
JER.4.20	their
JER.4.21	 “How long must I see the enemy’s battle flags
JER.4.21	and hear the military signals of their bugles?”
JER.4.22	 The 
JER.4.22	“This will happen
JER.4.22	They do not know me.
JER.4.22	They are like children who have no sense.
JER.4.22	They have no understanding.
JER.4.22	They are skilled at doing evil.
JER.4.22	They do not know how to do good.”
JER.4.23	 “I looked at the land and saw
JER.4.23	I looked up at the sky, and its light had vanished.
JER.4.24	 I looked at the mountains and saw that they were shaking.
JER.4.24	All the hills were swaying back and forth!
JER.4.25	 I looked and saw that there were no more people,
JER.4.25	and that all the birds in the sky had flown away.
JER.4.26	 I looked and saw that the fruitful land had become a desert
JER.4.26	and that all of the cities had been laid in ruins.
JER.4.26	The 
JER.4.26	because of his blazing anger.
JER.4.27	 All this will happen because the 
JER.4.27	“The whole land will be desolate;
JER.4.27	however, I will not completely destroy it.
JER.4.28	 Because of this the land will mourn
JER.4.28	and the sky above will grow black.
JER.4.28	For I have made my purpose known
JER.4.28	and I will not relent or turn back from carrying it out.”
JER.4.29	 At the sound of the approaching horsemen and archers
JER.4.29	the people of every town will flee.
JER.4.29	Some of them will hide in the thickets.
JER.4.29	Others will climb up among the rocks.
JER.4.29	All the cities will be deserted.
JER.4.29	No one will remain in them.
JER.4.30	 And you, Zion, city doomed to destruction,
JER.4.30	you accomplish nothing
JER.4.30	decking yourself out in jewels of gold,
JER.4.30	and putting on eye shadow!
JER.4.30	You are making yourself beautiful for nothing.
JER.4.30	Your lovers spurn you.
JER.4.30	They want to kill you.
JER.4.31	 In fact,
JER.4.31	a cry of anguish like that of a woman giving birth to her first baby.
JER.4.31	It is the cry of Daughter Zion
JER.4.31	reaching out for help,
JER.4.31	My life is ebbing away before these murderers!”
JER.5.1	 The 
JER.5.1	“Go up and down
JER.5.1	Look around and see for yourselves.
JER.5.1	Search through its public squares.
JER.5.1	See if any of you can find a single person
JER.5.1	who deals honestly and tries to be truthful.
JER.5.1	If you can,
JER.5.2	 These people make promises in the name of the 
JER.5.2	But the fact is,
JER.5.3	But even when you punish these people, they feel no remorse.
JER.5.3	Even when you nearly destroy them, they refuse to be corrected.
JER.5.3	They have become as hardheaded as a rock.
JER.5.3	They refuse to change their ways.
JER.5.4	 I thought, “Surely it is only the ignorant poor who act this way.
JER.5.4	They act like fools because they do not know what the 
JER.5.4	They do not know what their God requires of them.
JER.5.5	 I will go to the leaders
JER.5.5	and speak with them.
JER.5.5	Surely they know what the 
JER.5.5	Surely they know what their God requires of them.”
JER.5.5	Yet all of them, too, have rejected his authority
JER.5.5	and refuse to submit to him.
JER.5.6	 So like a lion from the thicket their enemies will kill them.
JER.5.6	Like a wolf from the desert they will destroy them.
JER.5.6	Like a leopard they will lie in wait outside their cities
JER.5.6	and totally destroy anyone who ventures out.
JER.5.6	For they have rebelled so much
JER.5.6	and done so many unfaithful things.
JER.5.7	 The 
JER.5.7	“How can I leave you unpunished, Jerusalem?
JER.5.7	Your people
JER.5.7	and have worshiped gods that are not gods at all.
JER.5.7	Even though I supplied all their needs,
JER.5.7	They went flocking
JER.5.8	 They are like lusty, well-fed
JER.5.8	Each of them lusts after
JER.5.9	 I will surely punish them for doing such things!” says the 
JER.5.9	“I will surely bring retribution on such a nation as this!”
JER.5.10	 The 
JER.5.10	“March through the vineyards of Israel and Judah and ruin them.
JER.5.10	But do not destroy them completely.
JER.5.10	Strip off their branches
JER.5.10	for these people do not belong to the 
JER.5.11	 For the nations of Israel and Judah
JER.5.11	have been very unfaithful to me,”
JER.5.11	says the 
JER.5.12	 “These people have denied what the 
JER.5.12	They have said, ‘That is not so!
JER.5.12	No harm will come to us.
JER.5.12	We will not experience war and famine.
JER.5.13	 The prophets will prove to be full of wind.
JER.5.13	The 
JER.5.13	So, let what they say happen to them.’”
JER.5.14	 Because of that,
JER.5.14	“Because these people have spoken
JER.5.14	I will make the words that I put in your mouth like fire.
JER.5.14	And I will make this people like wood 
JER.5.14	which the fiery judgments you speak will burn up.”
JER.5.15	 The 
JER.5.15	I am about to bring a nation from far away to attack you.
JER.5.15	It will be a nation that was founded long ago
JER.5.15	and has lasted for a long time.
JER.5.15	It will be a nation whose language you will not know.
JER.5.15	Its people will speak words that you will not be able to understand.
JER.5.16	 All of its soldiers are strong and mighty.
JER.5.16	Their arrows will send you to your grave.
JER.5.17	 They will eat up your crops and your food.
JER.5.17	They will kill off
JER.5.17	They will eat up your sheep and your cattle.
JER.5.17	They will destroy your vines and your fig trees.
JER.5.17	Their weapons will batter down
JER.5.17	the fortified cities you trust in.
JER.5.18	 Yet even then
JER.5.19	 “So then, Jeremiah,
JER.5.20	 “Proclaim
JER.5.20	Make it known throughout Judah.
JER.5.21	 Tell them: ‘Hear this,
JER.5.21	you foolish people who have no understanding,
JER.5.21	who have eyes but do not discern,
JER.5.21	who have ears but do not perceive:
JER.5.22	 “You should fear me!” says the 
JER.5.22	“You should tremble in awe before me!
JER.5.22	I made the sand to be a boundary for the sea,
JER.5.22	a permanent barrier that it can never cross.
JER.5.22	Its waves may roll, but they can never prevail.
JER.5.22	They may roar, but they can never cross beyond that boundary.”
JER.5.23	 But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts.
JER.5.23	They have turned aside and gone their own way.
JER.5.24	 They do not say to themselves,
JER.5.24	“Let us revere the 
JER.5.24	It is he who gives us the autumn rains and the spring rains at the proper time.
JER.5.24	It is he who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.”
JER.5.25	 Your misdeeds have stopped these things from coming.
JER.5.25	Your sins have deprived you of my bounty.’
JER.5.26	 “Indeed, there are wicked scoundrels among my people.
JER.5.26	They lie in wait like bird catchers hiding in ambush.
JER.5.26	They set deadly traps
JER.5.27	 Like a cage filled with the birds that have been caught,
JER.5.27	their houses are filled with the gains of their fraud and deceit.
JER.5.27	That is how they have gotten so rich and powerful.
JER.5.28	 That is how
JER.5.28	There is no limit to the evil things they do.
JER.5.28	They do not plead the cause of the fatherless in such a way as to win it.
JER.5.28	They do not defend the rights of the poor.
JER.5.29	 I will certainly punish them for doing such things!” says the 
JER.5.29	“I will certainly bring retribution on such a nation as this!
JER.5.30	 “Something horrible and shocking
JER.5.30	is going on in the land of Judah:
JER.5.31	 The prophets prophesy lies.
JER.5.31	The priests exercise power by their own authority.
JER.5.31	And my people love to have it this way.
JER.5.31	But they will not be able to help you when the time of judgment comes!
JER.6.1	 “Run for safety, people of Benjamin!
JER.6.1	Get out of Jerusalem!
JER.6.1	Sound the trumpet
JER.6.1	Light the signal fires at Beth Hakkerem!
JER.6.1	For disaster lurks

JER.6.2	 I will destroy
JER.6.2	who is as delicate and defenseless as a young maiden.
JER.6.3	 Kings will come against it with their armies.
JER.6.3	They will encamp in siege all around it.
JER.6.3	Each of them will devastate the portion assigned to him.
JER.6.4	 They will say,
JER.6.4	Come on! Let’s attack it at noon!’
JER.6.4	But later they will say,
JER.6.4	The day is almost over
JER.6.4	and the shadows of evening are getting long.
JER.6.5	 So come on, let’s go ahead and attack it by night
JER.6.5	and destroy all its fortified buildings.’
JER.6.6	 All of this is because
JER.6.6	‘Cut down the trees around Jerusalem
JER.6.6	and build up a siege ramp against its walls.
JER.6.6	This is the city which is to be punished.
JER.6.6	Nothing but oppression happens in it.
JER.6.7	 As a well continually pours out fresh water
JER.6.7	so it continually pours out wicked deeds.
JER.6.7	Sounds of violence and destruction echo throughout it.
JER.6.7	All I see are sick and wounded people.’
JER.6.8	 So
JER.6.8	or I will abandon you in disgust
JER.6.8	and make you desolate,
JER.6.8	a place where no one can live.”
JER.6.9	 This is what the 
JER.6.9	“Those who remain in Israel will be 
JER.6.9	like the grapes thoroughly gleaned
JER.6.9	So go over them again, as though you were a grape harvester
JER.6.9	passing your hand over the branches one last time.”
JER.6.10	 I answered,
JER.6.10	“Who would listen
JER.6.10	if I spoke to them and warned them?
JER.6.10	Their ears are so closed
JER.6.10	that they cannot hear!
JER.6.10	Indeed,
JER.6.10	They do not like it at all.
JER.6.11	 I am as full of anger as you are, 
JER.6.11	I am tired of trying to hold it in.”
JER.6.11	The 
JER.6.11	“Vent it, then,
JER.6.11	and on the young men who are gathered together.
JER.6.11	Husbands and wives are to be included,
JER.6.11	as well as the old and those who are advanced in years.
JER.6.12	 Their houses will be turned over to others
JER.6.12	as will their fields and their wives.
JER.6.12	For I will unleash my power
JER.6.12	against those who live in this land,”
JER.6.12	says the 
JER.6.13	 “That is because, from the least important to the most important of them,
JER.6.13	all of them are greedy for dishonest gain.
JER.6.13	Prophets and priests alike,
JER.6.13	all of them practice deceit.
JER.6.14	 They offer only superficial help 
JER.6.14	for the harm my people have suffered.
JER.6.14	They say, ‘Everything will be all right!’
JER.6.14	But everything is not all right!
JER.6.15	 Are they ashamed because they have done such shameful things?
JER.6.15	No, they are not at all ashamed.
JER.6.15	They do not even know how to blush!
JER.6.15	So they will die, just like others have died.
JER.6.15	They will be brought to ruin when I punish them,”
JER.6.15	says the 
JER.6.16	 The 
JER.6.16	“You are standing at the crossroads. So consider your path.
JER.6.16	Ask where the old, reliable paths
JER.6.16	Ask where the path is that leads to blessing
JER.6.16	If you do, you will find rest for your souls.”
JER.6.16	But they said, “We will not follow it!”
JER.6.17	 The 
JER.6.17	“I appointed prophets as watchmen to warn you,
JER.6.17	‘Pay attention to the warning sound of the trumpet!’”
JER.6.17	But they said, “We will not pay attention!”
JER.6.18	 So the 
JER.6.18	“Hear, you nations!
JER.6.18	Be witnesses and take note of what will happen to these people.
JER.6.19	 Hear this, you peoples of the earth:
JER.6.19	‘Take note!
JER.6.19	It will come as punishment for their scheming.
JER.6.19	For they have paid no attention to what I have said,
JER.6.19	and they have rejected my law.
JER.6.20	 I take no delight
JER.6.20	frankincense that comes from Sheba 
JER.6.20	or sweet-smelling cane imported from a faraway land.
JER.6.20	I cannot accept the burnt offerings they bring me.
JER.6.20	I get no pleasure from the sacrifices they offer to me.’
JER.6.21	 So, this is what the 
JER.6.21	‘I will assuredly
JER.6.21	Parents and children will stumble and fall to their destruction.
JER.6.21	Friends and neighbors will die.’
JER.6.22	 “This is what the 
JER.6.22	‘Beware! An army
JER.6.22	A mighty nation is stirring into action in faraway parts of the earth.
JER.6.23	 Its soldiers are armed with bows and spears.
JER.6.23	They are cruel and show no mercy.
JER.6.23	They sound like the roaring sea
JER.6.23	as they ride forth on their horses.
JER.6.23	Lined up in formation like men going into battle
JER.6.23	to attack you, Daughter Zion.’”
JER.6.24	 The people cry out,
JER.6.24	We have become helpless with fear!
JER.6.24	Anguish grips us,
JER.6.24	agony like that of a woman giving birth to a baby!
JER.6.25	 Do not go out into the countryside.
JER.6.25	Do not travel on the roads.
JER.6.25	For the enemy is there with sword in hand.
JER.6.25	They are spreading terror everywhere.”
JER.6.26	 So I said,
JER.6.26	and roll in ashes.
JER.6.26	Mourn with painful sobs
JER.6.26	as though you had lost your only child.
JER.6.26	For any moment now
JER.6.26	will come against us.”
JER.6.27	 The 
JER.6.27	“I have made you like a metal assayer
JER.6.27	to test my people like ore.
JER.6.27	You are to observe them
JER.6.27	and evaluate how they behave.”
JER.6.28	 I reported,
JER.6.28	“All of them are the most stubborn of rebels!
JER.6.28	They are as hard as bronze or iron.
JER.6.28	They go about telling lies.
JER.6.28	They all deal corruptly.
JER.6.29	 The fiery bellows of judgment burn fiercely.
JER.6.29	But there is too much dross to be removed.
JER.6.29	The process of refining them has proved useless.
JER.6.29	The wicked have not been purged.
JER.6.30	 They are regarded as ‘rejected silver’
JER.6.30	because the 
JER.7.1	 The 
JER.7.2	 “Stand in the gate of the 
JER.7.3	 The 
JER.7.4	 Stop putting your confidence in the false belief that says,
JER.7.5	 You must change
JER.7.6	 Stop oppressing foreigners who live in your land, children who have lost their fathers, and women who have lost their husbands.
JER.7.7	 If you stop doing these things,
JER.7.8	 “‘But just look at you!
JER.7.9	 You steal.
JER.7.10	 Then you come and stand in my presence in this temple I have claimed as my own
JER.7.11	 Do you think this temple I have claimed as my own
JER.7.12	 So, go to the place in Shiloh where I allowed myself to be worshiped
JER.7.13	 You also have done all these things, says the 
JER.7.14	 So I will destroy this temple which I have claimed as my own,
JER.7.15	 And I will drive you out of my sight just like I drove out your relatives, the people of Israel.’”
JER.7.16	 Then the 
JER.7.17	 Do you see
JER.7.18	 Children are gathering firewood, fathers are building fires with it, and women are mixing dough to bake cakes to offer to the goddess they call the Queen of Heaven.
JER.7.19	 But I am not really the one being troubled!”
JER.7.20	 So,” the Lord 
JER.7.21	 The 
JER.7.22	 Consider this:
JER.7.23	 I also explicitly commanded them:
JER.7.24	 But they did not listen to me or pay any attention to me. They followed the stubborn inclinations of their own wicked hearts. They acted worse and worse instead of better.
JER.7.25	 From the time your ancestors departed the land of Egypt until now,
JER.7.26	 But your ancestors
JER.7.27	 Then the 
JER.7.28	 So tell them: ‘This is a nation that has not obeyed the 
JER.7.29	 So, mourn,
JER.7.30	 The 
JER.7.31	 They have also built places of worship
JER.7.32	 So, watch out!”
JER.7.33	 Then the dead bodies of these people will be left on the ground for the birds and wild animals to eat.
JER.7.34	 I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness, or the glad celebration of brides and grooms throughout the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. For the whole land will become a desolate wasteland.”
JER.8.1	 The 
JER.8.2	 They will be spread out and exposed to the sun, the moon and the stars.
JER.8.3	 However, I will leave some of these wicked people alive and banish them to other places. But wherever these people who survive may go, they will wish they had died rather than lived,”
JER.8.4	 The 
JER.8.4	“Tell them, ‘The 
JER.8.4	Do people not get back up when they fall down?
JER.8.4	Do they not turn around when they go the wrong way?
JER.8.5	 Why, then, do these people of Jerusalem
JER.8.5	continually turn away from me in apostasy?
JER.8.5	They hold fast to their deception.
JER.8.5	They refuse to turn back to me.
JER.8.6	 I have listened to them very carefully,
JER.8.6	but they do not speak honestly.
JER.8.6	None of them regrets the evil he has done.
JER.8.6	None of them says, “I have done wrong!”
JER.8.6	All of them persist in their own wayward course
JER.8.6	like a horse charging recklessly into battle.
JER.8.7	 Even the stork knows 
JER.8.7	when it is time to move on.
JER.8.7	The turtledove, swallow, and crane
JER.8.7	recognize
JER.8.7	But my people pay no attention
JER.8.7	to
JER.8.8	 How can you say, “We are wise!
JER.8.8	We have the law of the 
JER.8.8	The truth is,
JER.8.8	to make it say what it does not really mean.
JER.8.9	 Your wise men will be put to shame.
JER.8.9	They will be dumbfounded and be brought to judgment.
JER.8.9	Since they have rejected the word of the 
JER.8.9	what wisdom do they really have?
JER.8.10	 So I will give their wives to other men
JER.8.10	and their fields to new owners.
JER.8.10	For from the least important to the most important of them,
JER.8.10	all of them are greedy for dishonest gain.
JER.8.10	Prophets and priests alike,
JER.8.10	all practice deceit.
JER.8.11	 They offer only superficial help 
JER.8.11	for the hurt my dear people
JER.8.11	They say, “Everything will be all right!”
JER.8.11	But everything is not all right!
JER.8.12	 Are they ashamed because they have done such disgusting things?
JER.8.12	No, they are not at all ashamed!
JER.8.12	They do not even know how to blush!
JER.8.12	So they will die just like others have died.
JER.8.12	They will be brought to ruin when I punish them,
JER.8.12	says the 
JER.8.13	 I will take away their harvests,
JER.8.13	There will be no grapes on their vines.
JER.8.13	There will be no figs on their fig trees.
JER.8.13	Even the leaves on their trees will wither.
JER.8.13	The crops that I gave them will be taken away.’”
JER.8.14	 The people say,
JER.8.14	“Why are we just sitting here?
JER.8.14	Let us gather together inside the fortified cities.
JER.8.14	Let us at least die there fighting,
JER.8.14	since the 
JER.8.14	He has condemned us to drink the poison waters of judgment
JER.8.14	because we have sinned against him.
JER.8.15	 We hoped for good fortune, but nothing good has come of it.
JER.8.15	We hoped for a time of relief, but instead we experience terror.
JER.8.16	 The snorting of the enemy’s horses
JER.8.16	is already being heard in the city of Dan.
JER.8.16	The sound of the neighing of their stallions
JER.8.16	causes the whole land to tremble with fear.
JER.8.16	They are coming to destroy the land and everything in it!
JER.8.16	They are coming to destroy
JER.8.17	 The 
JER.8.17	“Yes indeed,
JER.8.17	that will be like poisonous snakes which cannot be charmed away.
JER.8.17	And they will inflict fatal wounds on you.”
JER.8.18	 Then I said,
JER.8.18	“There is no cure
JER.8.18	I am sick at heart!
JER.8.19	 I hear my dear people
JER.8.19	throughout the length and breadth of the land.
JER.8.19	They are crying, ‘Is the 
JER.8.19	Is her divine King
JER.8.19	The 
JER.8.19	“Why then do they provoke me to anger with their images,
JER.8.19	with their worthless foreign idols?”
JER.8.20	 “They cry,
JER.8.20	and still we have not been delivered.’
JER.8.21	 My heart is crushed because my dear people
JER.8.21	I go about crying and grieving. I am overwhelmed with dismay.
JER.8.22	 There is still medicinal ointment
JER.8.22	There is still a physician there!
JER.8.22	Why then have my dear people
JER.8.22	not been restored to health?
JER.9.1	and my eyes were a fountain full of tears!
JER.9.1	If they were, I could cry day and night 
JER.9.1	for those of my dear people
JER.9.2	where I could spend some time like a weary traveler.
JER.9.2	Then I would desert my people
JER.9.2	and walk away from them
JER.9.2	because they are all unfaithful to God,
JER.9.2	a congregation
JER.9.3	 The 
JER.9.3	“These people are like soldiers who have readied their bows.
JER.9.3	Their tongues are always ready to shoot out lies.
JER.9.3	They have become powerful in the land, 
JER.9.3	but they have not done so by honest means.
JER.9.3	Indeed, they do one evil thing after another
JER.9.3	and do not pay attention to me.
JER.9.4	 Everyone must be on his guard around his friends.
JER.9.4	He must not even trust any of his relatives.
JER.9.4	For every one of them will find some way to cheat him.
JER.9.4	And all of his friends will tell lies about him.
JER.9.5	 One friend deceives another
JER.9.5	and no one tells the truth.
JER.9.5	These people have trained themselves
JER.9.5	They do wrong and are unable to repent.
JER.9.6	 They do one act of violence after another,
JER.9.6	and one deceitful thing after another.
JER.9.6	They refuse to pay attention to me,”
JER.9.6	says the 
JER.9.7	 Therefore the 
JER.9.7	“I will now purify them in the fires of affliction
JER.9.7	The wickedness of my dear people
JER.9.7	What else can I do?
JER.9.8	 Their tongues are like deadly arrows.
JER.9.8	They are always telling lies.
JER.9.8	Friendly words for their neighbors come from their mouths.
JER.9.8	But their minds are thinking up ways to trap them.
JER.9.9	 I will certainly punish them for doing such things!” says the 
JER.9.9	“I will certainly bring retribution on such a nation as this!”
JER.9.10	 I said,
JER.9.10	“I will weep and mourn
JER.9.10	I will sing a mournful song for the pastures in the wilderness
JER.9.10	because they are so scorched no one travels through them.
JER.9.10	The sound of livestock is no longer heard there.
JER.9.10	Even the birds in the sky and the wild animals in the fields
JER.9.10	have fled and are gone.”
JER.9.11	 The 
JER.9.11	“I will make Jerusalem
JER.9.11	Jackals will make their home there.
JER.9.11	I will destroy the towns of Judah
JER.9.11	so that no one will be able to live in them.”
JER.9.12	 I said,
JER.9.12	“Who is wise enough to understand why this has happened?
JER.9.12	Who has a word from the 
JER.9.12	Why does the land lie in ruins?
JER.9.12	Why is it as scorched as a desert through which no one travels?”
JER.9.13	 The 
JER.9.14	 Instead they have followed the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts. They have paid allegiance to
JER.9.15	 So then, listen to what I, the 
JER.9.16	 I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors
JER.9.17	 The 
JER.9.17	“Take note of what I say.
JER.9.17	Call for the women who mourn for the dead!
JER.9.17	Summon those who are the most skilled at it!”
JER.9.18	 I said, “Indeed,
JER.9.18	Let them wail loudly until tears stream from our own eyes
JER.9.18	and our eyelids overflow with water.
JER.9.19	 For the sound of wailing is soon to be heard in Zion.
JER.9.19	They will wail,
JER.9.19	For our houses have been torn down
JER.9.19	and we must leave our land.’”
JER.9.20	 I said,
JER.9.20	“So now,
JER.9.20	Open your ears to the words from his mouth.
JER.9.20	Teach your daughters this mournful song,
JER.9.20	and each of you teach your neighbor
JER.9.21	 ‘Death has climbed in
JER.9.21	It has entered into our fortified houses.
JER.9.21	It has taken away our children who play in the streets.
JER.9.21	It has taken away our young men who gather in the city squares.’
JER.9.22	 Tell your daughters and neighbors, ‘The 
JER.9.22	“The dead bodies of people will lie scattered everywhere
JER.9.22	like manure scattered on a field.
JER.9.22	They will lie scattered on the ground 
JER.9.22	like grain that has been cut down but has not been gathered.”’”
JER.9.23	 The 
JER.9.23	“Wise people should not boast that they are wise.
JER.9.23	Powerful people should not boast that they are powerful.
JER.9.23	Rich people should not boast that they are rich.
JER.9.24	 If people want to boast, they should boast about this:
JER.9.24	They should boast that they understand and know me.
JER.9.24	They should boast that they know and understand
JER.9.24	that I, the 
JER.9.24	and that I desire people to do these things,”
JER.9.24	says the 
JER.9.25	 The 
JER.9.26	 That is, I will punish the Egyptians, the Judeans, the Edomites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, and all the desert people who cut their hair short at the temples.
JER.10.1	 You people of Israel,
JER.10.2	 The 
JER.10.2	“Do not start following pagan religious practices.
JER.10.2	Do not be in awe of signs that occur
JER.10.2	even though the nations hold them in awe.
JER.10.3	 For the religion
JER.10.3	They cut down a tree in the forest,
JER.10.3	and a craftsman makes it into an idol with his tools.
JER.10.4	 He decorates it with overlays of silver and gold.
JER.10.4	He uses hammer and nails to fasten it
JER.10.4	so that it will not fall over.
JER.10.5	 Such idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field.
JER.10.5	They cannot talk.
JER.10.5	They must be carried 
JER.10.5	because they cannot walk.
JER.10.5	Do not be afraid of them
JER.10.5	because they cannot hurt you.
JER.10.5	And they do not have any power to help you.”
JER.10.6	 I said,
JER.10.6	“There is no one like you, 
JER.10.6	You are great.
JER.10.6	And you are renowned for your power.
JER.10.7	 Everyone should revere you, O King of all nations,
JER.10.7	because you deserve to be revered.
JER.10.7	For there is no one like you
JER.10.7	among any of the wise people of the nations nor among any of their kings.
JER.10.8	 The people of those nations
JER.10.8	Instruction from a wooden idol is worthless!
JER.10.9	 Hammered-out silver is brought from Tarshish
JER.10.9	and gold is brought from Uphaz
JER.10.9	They are the handiwork of carpenters and goldsmiths.
JER.10.9	They are clothed in blue and purple clothes.
JER.10.9	They are all made by skillful workers.
JER.10.10	 The 
JER.10.10	He is the living God and the everlasting King.
JER.10.10	When he shows his anger the earth shakes.
JER.10.10	None of the nations can stand up to his fury.
JER.10.11	 You people of Israel should tell those nations this:
JER.10.11	‘These gods did not make heaven and earth.
JER.10.11	They will disappear
JER.10.12	 The 
JER.10.12	He is the one who by his wisdom established the world.
JER.10.12	And by his understanding he spread out the skies.
JER.10.13	 When his voice thunders,
JER.10.13	He makes the clouds rise from the far-off horizons.
JER.10.13	He makes the lightning flash out in the midst of the rain.
JER.10.13	He unleashes the wind from the places where he stores it.
JER.10.14	 All these idolaters
JER.10.14	Every goldsmith will be disgraced by the idol he made.
JER.10.14	For the image he forges is merely a sham.
JER.10.14	There is no breath in any of those idols.
JER.10.15	 They are worthless, mere objects to be mocked.
JER.10.15	When the time comes to punish them, they will be destroyed.
JER.10.16	 The 
JER.10.16	He is the one who created everything.
JER.10.16	And the people of Israel are those he claims as his own.
JER.10.16	He is known as the 
JER.10.17	 Gather your belongings together and prepare to leave the land,
JER.10.17	you people of Jerusalem
JER.10.18	 For the 
JER.10.18	those who live in this land.
JER.10.18	I will bring so much trouble on them
JER.10.18	that they will actually feel it.”
JER.10.19	 And I cried out,
JER.10.19	Our wound is severe!
JER.10.19	We once thought, ‘This is only an illness.
JER.10.19	And we will be able to bear it!’
JER.10.20	 But our tents have been destroyed.
JER.10.20	The ropes that held them in place have been ripped apart.
JER.10.20	Our children are gone and are not coming back.
JER.10.20	There is no survivor to put our tents back up,
JER.10.20	no one left to hang their tent curtains in place.
JER.10.21	 For our leaders
JER.10.21	They have not sought the 
JER.10.21	So they do not act wisely,
JER.10.21	and the people they are responsible for
JER.10.22	 Listen! News is coming even now.
JER.10.22	The rumble of a great army is heard approaching
JER.10.22	It is coming to turn the towns of Judah into rubble,
JER.10.22	places where only jackals live.
JER.10.23	It is not in their power to determine what will happen to them.
JER.10.24	 Correct us, 
JER.10.24	Do not punish us in anger or you will reduce us to nothing.
JER.10.25	 Vent your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you.
JER.10.25	Vent it on the peoples
JER.10.25	For they have destroyed the people of Jacob.
JER.10.25	They have completely destroyed them
JER.10.25	and left their homeland in utter ruin.
JER.11.1	 The 
JER.11.2	 “Hear
JER.11.3	 Tell them that the 
JER.11.4	 Those are the terms that I charged your ancestors
JER.11.5	 Then I will keep the promise I swore on oath to your ancestors to give them a land flowing with milk and honey.”
JER.11.6	 The 
JER.11.7	 For I solemnly warned your ancestors to obey me.
JER.11.8	 But they did not listen to me or pay any attention to me! Each one of them followed the stubborn inclinations of his own wicked heart. So I brought on them all the punishments threatened in the covenant because they did not carry out its terms as I commanded them to do.’”
JER.11.9	 The 
JER.11.10	 They have gone back to the evil ways
JER.11.11	 So I, the 
JER.11.12	 Then those living in the towns of Judah and in Jerusalem will
JER.11.13	 This is in spite of the fact that
JER.11.14	 So, Jeremiah,
JER.11.15	 The 
JER.11.15	“What right do you have to be in my temple, my beloved people?
JER.11.15	Many of you have done wicked things.
JER.11.15	Can your acts of treachery be so easily canceled by sacred offerings
JER.11.15	that you take joy in doing evil even while you make them?
JER.11.16	 I, the 
JER.11.16	one that produced beautiful fruit.
JER.11.16	But I will set you
JER.11.16	fire that will blaze with a mighty roar.
JER.11.16	Then all your branches will be good for nothing.
JER.11.17	 For though I, the 
JER.11.17	I now decree that disaster will come on you
JER.11.17	because the nations of Israel and Judah have done evil
JER.11.17	and have made me angry by offering sacrifices to the god Baal.”
JER.11.18	 The 
JER.11.18	Then he showed me what the people were doing.
JER.11.19	 Before this I had been like a docile lamb ready to be led to the slaughter. 
JER.11.19	I did not know they were making plans to kill me.
JER.11.19	I did not know they were saying,
JER.11.19	“Let’s destroy the tree along with its fruit!
JER.11.19	Let’s remove Jeremiah
JER.11.19	so people will not even be reminded of him any more.”
JER.11.20	 So I said to the 
JER.11.20	“O 
JER.11.20	You examine people’s hearts and minds.
JER.11.20	I want to see you pay them back for what they have done
JER.11.20	because I trust you to vindicate my cause.”
JER.11.21	 Then the 
JER.11.22	 So the 
JER.11.23	 Not one of them will survive.
JER.12.1	whenever I have complained to you.
JER.12.1	However, I would like to speak with you about the disposition of justice.
JER.12.1	Why are wicked people successful?
JER.12.1	Why do all dishonest people have such easy lives?
JER.12.2	 You plant them like trees and they put down their roots.
JER.12.2	They grow prosperous and are very fruitful.
JER.12.2	They always talk about you,
JER.12.2	but they really care nothing about you.
JER.12.3	 But you, 
JER.12.3	You watch me and test my devotion to you.
JER.12.3	Drag these wicked men away like sheep to be slaughtered!
JER.12.3	Appoint a time when they will be killed!
JER.12.4	 How long must the land be parched
JER.12.4	and the grass in every field be withered?
JER.12.4	How long
JER.12.4	because of the wickedness of the people who live in this land?
JER.12.4	For these people boast,
JER.12.4	“God
JER.12.5	 The 
JER.12.5	“If you have raced on foot against men and they have worn you out,
JER.12.5	how will you be able to compete with horses?
JER.12.5	And if you feel secure only
JER.12.5	how will you manage in the thick undergrowth along the Jordan River?
JER.12.6	 As a matter of fact,
JER.12.6	and the members of your own family have betrayed you too. 
JER.12.6	Even they have plotted to do away with you.
JER.12.6	So do not trust them even when they say kind things
JER.12.7	 “I will abandon my nation.
JER.12.7	I will forsake the people I call my own.
JER.12.7	I will turn my beloved people
JER.12.7	over to the power
JER.12.8	 The people I call my own
JER.12.8	like a lion
JER.12.8	They have roared defiantly
JER.12.8	So I will treat them as though I hate them.
JER.12.9	 The people I call my own attack me like birds of prey or like hyenas.
JER.12.9	But other birds of prey are all around them.
JER.12.9	Let all the nations gather together like wild beasts.
JER.12.9	Let them come and destroy these people I call my own.
JER.12.10	 Many foreign rulers
JER.12.10	They will trample all over my chosen land.
JER.12.10	They will turn my beautiful land
JER.12.10	into a desolate wasteland.
JER.12.11	 They will lay it waste.
JER.12.11	It will lie parched
JER.12.11	The whole land will be laid waste.
JER.12.11	But no one living in it will pay any heed.
JER.12.12	 A destructive army
JER.12.12	over the hilltops in the desert.
JER.12.12	For the 
JER.12.12	against
JER.12.12	No one will be safe.
JER.12.13	 My people will sow wheat, but will harvest weeds.
JER.12.13	They will work until they are exhausted, but will get nothing from it.
JER.12.13	They will be disappointed in their harvests
JER.12.13	because the 
JER.12.14	 “I, the 
JER.12.15	 But after I have uprooted the people of those nations, I will relent
JER.12.16	 But they must make sure you learn to follow the religious practices of my people.
JER.12.17	 But I will completely uproot and destroy any of those nations that will not pay heed,’”
JER.13.1	 The 
JER.13.2	 So I bought the shorts as the 
JER.13.3	 Then the 
JER.13.4	 “Take the shorts that you bought and are wearing
JER.13.5	 So I went and buried them at Perath
JER.13.6	 Many days later the 
JER.13.7	 So I went to Perath and dug up
JER.13.8	 Then the 
JER.13.9	 “I, the 
JER.13.10	 These wicked people refuse to obey what I have said.
JER.13.11	 For,’ I say,
JER.13.12	 “So tell them,
JER.13.13	 Then
JER.13.14	 And I will smash them like wine bottles against one another, children and parents alike.
JER.13.15	 Then I said to the people of Judah,
JER.13.15	“Listen and pay attention! Do not be arrogant!
JER.13.15	For the 
JER.13.16	 Show the 
JER.13.16	Do it before he brings the darkness of disaster.
JER.13.16	Do it before you stumble
JER.13.16	like a traveler on the mountains at twilight.
JER.13.16	Do it before he turns the light of deliverance you hope for
JER.13.16	into the darkness and gloom of exile.
JER.13.17	 But if you will not pay attention to this warning,
JER.13.17	I will weep alone because of your arrogant pride.
JER.13.17	I will weep bitterly and my eyes will overflow with tears
JER.13.17	because you, the 
JER.13.18	 The 
JER.13.18	“Tell the king and the queen mother,
JER.13.18	‘Surrender your thrones,
JER.13.18	for your glorious crowns
JER.13.18	will be removed
JER.13.19	 The gates of the towns in southern Judah will be shut tight.
JER.13.19	No one will be able to go in or out of them.
JER.13.19	All Judah will be carried off into exile.
JER.13.19	They will be completely carried off into exile.’”
JER.13.20	 Then I said,
JER.13.20	“Look up, Jerusalem,
JER.13.20	the enemy
JER.13.20	Where now is the flock of people that were entrusted to your care?
JER.13.20	Where now are the ‘sheep’ that you take such pride in?
JER.13.21	 What will you say
JER.13.21	that you, yourself, had actually prepared as such?
JER.13.21	Then anguish and agony will grip you
JER.13.21	like that of a woman giving birth to a baby.
JER.13.22	 You will probably ask yourself,
JER.13.22	‘Why have these things happened to me?
JER.13.22	Why have I been treated like a disgraced adulteress
JER.13.22	whose skirt has been torn off and her limbs exposed?’
JER.13.22	It is because you have sinned so much.
JER.13.23	 But there is little hope for you ever doing good,
JER.13.23	 you who are so accustomed to doing evil.
JER.13.23	Can an Ethiopian
JER.13.23	Can a leopard remove its spots?
JER.13.24	 “The 
JER.13.24	‘That is why I will scatter your people
JER.13.24	that is blown away by a desert wind.
JER.13.25	 This is your fate,
JER.13.25	the destiny to which I have appointed you,
JER.13.25	because you have forgotten me
JER.13.25	and have trusted in false gods.
JER.13.26	 So I will pull your skirt up over your face
JER.13.26	and expose you to shame like a disgraced adulteress!
JER.13.27	 People of Jerusalem,
JER.13.27	your shameless prostitution to, and your lustful pursuit of, other gods.
JER.13.27	I have seen your disgusting acts of worship
JER.13.27	on the hills throughout the countryside.
JER.13.27	You are doomed to destruction!
JER.13.27	How long will you continue to be unclean?’”
JER.14.1	 The 
JER.14.2	 “The people of Judah are in mourning.
JER.14.2	The people in her cities are pining away.
JER.14.2	They lie on the ground expressing their sorrow.
JER.14.2	Cries of distress come up to me
JER.14.3	 The leading men of the cities send their servants for water.
JER.14.3	They go to the cisterns,
JER.14.3	They return with their containers
JER.14.3	Disappointed and dismayed, they bury their faces in their hands.
JER.14.4	 They are dismayed because the ground is cracked
JER.14.4	because there has been no rain in the land.
JER.14.4	The farmers, too, are dismayed
JER.14.4	 and bury their faces in their hands.
JER.14.5	 Even the doe abandons her newborn fawn
JER.14.5	because there is no grass.
JER.14.6	 Wild donkeys stand on the hilltops
JER.14.6	and pant for breath like jackals.
JER.14.6	Their eyes are strained looking for food,
JER.14.6	because there is none to be found.”
JER.14.7	 Then I said,
JER.14.7	“O 
JER.14.7	even though our sins speak out against us.
JER.14.7	Indeed,
JER.14.7	We have sinned against you.
JER.14.8	 You have been the object of Israel’s hopes.
JER.14.8	You have saved them when they were in trouble.
JER.14.8	Why have you become like a resident foreigner
JER.14.8	Why have you become like a traveler who only stops in to spend the night?
JER.14.9	 Why should you be like someone who is helpless,
JER.14.9	like a champion
JER.14.9	You are indeed with us,
JER.14.9	and we belong to you.
JER.14.9	Do not abandon us!”
JER.14.10	 Then the 
JER.14.10	“They truly
JER.14.10	They cannot keep from running away from me.
JER.14.10	So I am not pleased with them.
JER.14.10	I will now call to mind
JER.14.10	and punish them for their sins.”
JER.14.11	 Then the 
JER.14.12	 Even if they fast, I will not hear their cries for help. Even if they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them.
JER.14.13	 Then I said, “Oh, Lord 
JER.14.14	 Then the 
JER.14.15	 I did not send those prophets, though they claim to be prophesying in my name. They may be saying, ‘No war or famine will happen in this land.’ But I, the 
JER.14.16	 The people to whom they are prophesying will die through war and famine. Their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem
JER.14.17	 “Tell these people this, Jeremiah:
JER.14.17	‘My eyes overflow with tears 
JER.14.17	day and night without ceasing.
JER.14.17	For my people, my dear children,
JER.14.17	They have suffered a serious wound.
JER.14.18	 If I go out into the countryside,
JER.14.18	I see those who have been killed in battle.
JER.14.18	If I go into the city,
JER.14.18	I see those who are sick because of starvation.
JER.14.18	For both prophet and priest go about their own business 
JER.14.18	in the land without having any real understanding.’”
JER.14.19	 Then I said,
JER.14.19	“
JER.14.19	Do you despise
JER.14.19	Why have you struck us with such force
JER.14.19	that we are beyond recovery?
JER.14.19	We hope for peace, but nothing good has come of it.
JER.14.19	We hope for a time of relief from our troubles, but experience terror.
JER.14.20	We confess that our ancestors have done wrong.
JER.14.20	We have indeed
JER.14.21	 For the honor of your name,
JER.14.21	Do not treat with disdain the place where your glorious throne sits.
JER.14.21	Be mindful of your covenant with us. Do not break it!
JER.14.22	 Do any of the worthless idols
JER.14.22	Do the skies themselves send showers?
JER.14.22	Is it not you, O Lord our God, who does this?
JER.14.22	So we put our hopes in you
JER.14.22	because you alone do all this.”
JER.15.1	 Then the 
JER.15.2	 If they ask you, ‘Where should we go?’ tell them the 
JER.15.2	“Those who are destined to die of disease will go to death by disease.
JER.15.2	Those who are destined to die in war will go to death in war.
JER.15.2	Those who are destined to die of starvation will go to death by starvation.
JER.15.2	Those who are destined to go into exile will go into exile.”
JER.15.3	 “I will punish them in four different ways: I will have war kill them. I will have dogs drag off their dead bodies. I will have birds and wild beasts devour and destroy their corpses.
JER.15.4	 I will make all the people in all the kingdoms of the world horrified at what has happened to them because of what Hezekiah’s son Manasseh, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.”
JER.15.5	 The 
JER.15.5	“Who in the world
JER.15.5	Who will grieve over you?
JER.15.5	Who will stop long enough
JER.15.5	to inquire about how you are doing?
JER.15.6	 I, the 
JER.15.6	You keep turning your back on me.’
JER.15.6	So I have unleashed my power against you
JER.15.6	I have grown tired of feeling sorry for you!”
JER.15.7	 The 
JER.15.7	“In every town in the land I will purge them 
JER.15.7	like straw blown away by the wind.
JER.15.7	I will destroy my people.
JER.15.7	I will kill off their children.
JER.15.7	I will do so because they did not change their behavior.
JER.15.8	 Their widows will become in my sight more numerous
JER.15.8	than the grains of sand on the seashores.
JER.15.8	At noontime I will bring a destroyer
JER.15.8	against the mothers of their young men.
JER.15.8	I will cause anguish
JER.15.8	to fall suddenly upon them.
JER.15.9	 The mother who had seven children
JER.15.9	All the breath will go out of her.
JER.15.9	Her pride and joy will be taken from her in the prime of their life.
JER.15.9	It will seem as if the sun had set while it was still day.
JER.15.9	She will suffer shame and humiliation.
JER.15.9	I will cause any of them who are still left alive
JER.15.9	to be killed in war by the onslaughts of their enemies,”
JER.15.9	says the 
JER.15.10	 I said,
JER.15.10	“Oh, mother, how I regret
JER.15.10	I am always starting arguments and quarrels with the people of this land.
JER.15.10	I have not lent money to anyone and I have not borrowed from anyone.
JER.15.10	Yet all of these people are treating me with contempt.”
JER.15.11	 The 
JER.15.11	“Jerusalem,
JER.15.11	I will surely
JER.15.12	 Can you people who are like iron and bronze
JER.15.12	break that iron fist from the north?
JER.15.13	 I will give away your wealth and your treasures as plunder.
JER.15.13	I will give it away free of charge for the sins you have committed throughout your land.
JER.15.14	 I will make you serve your enemies
JER.15.14	For my anger is like a fire that will burn against you.”
JER.15.15	 I said,
JER.15.15	“
JER.15.15	Take thought of me and care for me.
JER.15.15	Pay back for me those who have been persecuting me.
JER.15.15	Do not be so patient with them that you allow them to kill me.
JER.15.15	Be mindful of how I have put up with their insults for your sake.
JER.15.16	 As your words came to me I drank them in,
JER.15.16	and they filled my heart with joy and happiness
JER.15.16	because I belong to you.
JER.15.17	 I did not spend my time in the company of other people,
JER.15.17	laughing and having a good time.
JER.15.17	I stayed to myself because I felt obligated to you
JER.15.17	and because I was filled with anger at what they had done.
JER.15.18	 Why must I continually suffer such painful anguish?
JER.15.18	Why must I endure the sting of their insults like an incurable wound?
JER.15.18	Will you let me down when I need you
JER.15.18	like a brook one goes to for water, but that cannot be relied on?”
JER.15.19	 Because of this, the 
JER.15.19	“You must repent of such words and thoughts!
JER.15.19	If you do, I will restore you to the privilege of serving me.
JER.15.19	If you say what is worthwhile instead of what is worthless,
JER.15.19	I will again allow you to be my spokesman.
JER.15.19	They must become as you have been.
JER.15.19	You must not become like them.
JER.15.20	 I will make you as strong as a wall to these people,
JER.15.20	a fortified wall of bronze.
JER.15.20	They will attack you,
JER.15.20	but they will not be able to overcome you.
JER.15.20	For I will be with you to rescue you and deliver you,”
JER.15.20	says the 
JER.15.21	 “I will deliver you from the power of the wicked.
JER.15.21	I will free you from the clutches of violent people.”
JER.16.1	 The 
JER.16.2	 “Do not get married and do not have children here in this land. 
JER.16.3	 For I, the 
JER.16.4	 They will die of deadly diseases. No one will mourn for them. They will not be buried. Their dead bodies will lie like manure spread on the ground. They will be killed in war or die of starvation. Their corpses will be food for the birds and wild animals.
JER.16.5	 “Moreover I, the 
JER.16.6	 Rich and poor alike will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned. People will not cut their bodies or shave off their hair to show their grief for them.
JER.16.7	 No one will take any food to those who mourn for the dead to comfort them. No one will give them any wine to drink to console them for the loss of their father or mother.
JER.16.8	 “‘Do not go to a house where people are feasting and sit down to eat and drink with them either. 
JER.16.9	 For I, the 
JER.16.10	 “When you tell these people about all this,
JER.16.11	 Then tell them that the 
JER.16.12	 And you have acted even more wickedly than your ancestors! Each one of you has followed the stubborn inclinations of your own wicked heart and not obeyed me.
JER.16.13	 So I will throw you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have ever known. There you must worship other gods day and night, for I will show you no mercy.’”
JER.16.14	 Yet
JER.16.15	 But in that time they will affirm them with ‘I swear as surely as the 
JER.16.16	 But for now I, the 
JER.16.17	 For I see everything they do. Their wicked ways are not hidden from me. Their sin is not hidden away where I cannot see it.
JER.16.18	 Before I restore them
JER.16.19	 Then I said,
JER.16.19	“
JER.16.19	You are the one I can run to for safety when I am in trouble.
JER.16.19	Nations from all over the earth
JER.16.19	will come to you and say,
JER.16.19	‘Our ancestors had nothing but false gods – 
JER.16.19	worthless idols that could not help them at all.
JER.16.20	 Can people make their own gods?
JER.16.20	No, what they make are not gods at all.”
JER.16.21	 The 
JER.16.21	“So I will now let this wicked people know – 
JER.16.21	I will let them know my mighty power in judgment.
JER.16.21	Then they will know that my name is the 
JER.17.1	 The sin of Judah is engraved with an iron chisel
JER.17.1	on their stone-hard
JER.17.1	It is inscribed with a diamond
JER.17.1	on the horns of their altars.
JER.17.2	 Their children are always thinking about
JER.17.2	and their sacred poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah,
JER.17.2	set up beside the green trees on the high hills
JER.17.3	 and on the mountains and in the fields.
JER.17.3	I will give your wealth and all your treasures away as plunder.
JER.17.3	I will give it away as the price
JER.17.4	 You will lose your hold on the land
JER.17.4	which I gave to you as a permanent possession.
JER.17.4	I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you know nothing about.
JER.17.4	For you have made my anger burn like a fire that will never be put out.”
JER.17.5	 The 
JER.17.5	“I will put a curse on people 
JER.17.5	who trust in mere human beings,
JER.17.5	who depend on mere flesh and blood for their strength,
JER.17.5	and whose hearts
JER.17.6	 They will be like a shrub
JER.17.6	They will not experience good things even when they happen.
JER.17.6	It will be as though they were growing in the desert,
JER.17.6	in a salt land where no one can live.
JER.17.7	 My blessing is on those people who trust in me,
JER.17.7	who put their confidence in me.
JER.17.8	 They will be like a tree planted near a stream
JER.17.8	whose roots spread out toward the water.
JER.17.8	It has nothing to fear when the heat comes.
JER.17.8	Its leaves are always green.
JER.17.8	It has no need to be concerned in a year of drought.
JER.17.8	It does not stop bearing fruit.
JER.17.9	 The human mind is more deceitful than anything else.
JER.17.9	It is incurably bad.
JER.17.10	 I, the 
JER.17.10	I examine people’s hearts.
JER.17.10	I deal with each person according to how he has behaved.
JER.17.10	I give them what they deserve based on what they have done.
JER.17.11	 The person who gathers wealth by unjust means
JER.17.11	is like the partridge that broods over eggs but does not hatch them.
JER.17.11	Before his life is half over he will lose his ill-gotten gains.
JER.17.11	At the end of his life it will be clear he was a fool.”
JER.17.12	 Then I said,
JER.17.12	“
JER.17.12	you have been seated on your glorious throne on high.
JER.17.12	You are the place where we can find refuge.
JER.17.13	 You are the one in whom Israel may find hope.
JER.17.13	All who leave you will suffer shame.
JER.17.13	Those who turn away from you
JER.17.13	For they have rejected you, the 
JER.17.14	so that I may have some relief.
JER.17.14	Rescue me from those who persecute me
JER.17.14	so that I may be rescued.
JER.17.15	 Listen to what they are saying to me.
JER.17.15	They are saying, “Where are the things the 
JER.17.15	Come on! Let’s see them happen!”
JER.17.16	 But I have not pestered you to bring disaster.
JER.17.16	I have not desired the time of irreparable devastation.
JER.17.16	You know that.
JER.17.16	You are fully aware of every word that I have spoken.
JER.17.17	 Do not cause me dismay!
JER.17.17	You are my source of safety in times of trouble.
JER.17.18	 May those who persecute me be disgraced.
JER.17.18	Do not let me be disgraced.
JER.17.18	May they be dismayed.
JER.17.18	Do not let me be dismayed.
JER.17.18	Bring days of disaster on them.
JER.17.18	Bring on them the destruction they deserve.”
JER.17.19	 The 
JER.17.20	 As you stand in those places
JER.17.21	 The 
JER.17.22	 Do not carry any loads out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath day.
JER.17.23	 Your ancestors,
JER.17.24	 The 
JER.17.25	 If you do this,
JER.17.26	 Then people will come here from the towns in Judah, from the villages surrounding Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin, from the western foothills, from the southern hill country, and from the southern part of Judah. They will come bringing offerings to the temple of the 
JER.17.27	 But you must obey me and set the Sabbath day apart to me. You must not carry any loads in through
JER.18.1	 The 
JER.18.2	 “Go down at once
JER.18.3	 So I went down to the potter’s house and found him working
JER.18.4	 Now and then
JER.18.5	 Then the 
JER.18.6	 “I, the 
JER.18.7	 There are times, Jeremiah,
JER.18.8	 But if that nation I threatened stops doing wrong,
JER.18.9	 And there are times when I promise to build up and establish
JER.18.10	 But if that nation does what displeases me and does not obey me, then I will cancel the good I promised to do to it. 
JER.18.11	 So now, tell the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem
JER.18.12	 But they just keep saying, ‘We do not care what you say!
JER.18.13	 Therefore, the 
JER.18.13	“Ask the people of other nations
JER.18.13	whether they have heard of anything like this.
JER.18.13	Israel should have been like a virgin.
JER.18.13	But she has done something utterly revolting!
JER.18.14	 Does the snow ever completely vanish from the rocky slopes of Lebanon?
JER.18.14	Do the cool waters from those distant mountains ever cease to flow?
JER.18.15	 Yet my people have forgotten me
JER.18.15	and offered sacrifices to worthless idols!
JER.18.15	This makes them stumble along in the way they live
JER.18.15	and leave the old reliable path of their fathers.
JER.18.15	They have left them to walk in bypaths,
JER.18.15	in roads that are not smooth and level.
JER.18.16	 So their land will become an object of horror.
JER.18.16	People will forever hiss out their scorn over it.
JER.18.16	All who pass that way will be filled with horror
JER.18.16	and will shake their heads in derision.
JER.18.17	 I will scatter them before their enemies
JER.18.17	like dust blowing in front of a burning east wind.
JER.18.17	I will turn my back on them and not look favorably on them
JER.18.17	when disaster strikes them.”
JER.18.18	 Then some people
JER.18.19	 Then I said,
JER.18.19	“
JER.18.19	Listen to what my enemies are saying.
JER.18.20	 Should good be paid back with evil?
JER.18.20	Yet they are virtually digging a pit to kill me.
JER.18.20	Just remember how I stood before you
JER.18.20	pleading on their behalf
JER.18.20	to keep you from venting your anger on them.
JER.18.21	 So let their children die of starvation.
JER.18.21	Let them be cut down by the sword.
JER.18.21	Let their wives lose their husbands and children.
JER.18.21	Let the older men die of disease
JER.18.21	and the younger men die by the sword in battle.
JER.18.22	 Let cries of terror be heard in their houses
JER.18.22	when you send bands of raiders unexpectedly to plunder them.
JER.18.22	For they have virtually dug a pit to capture me
JER.18.22	and have hidden traps for me to step into.
JER.18.23	 But you, 
JER.18.23	all their plots to kill me.
JER.18.23	Do not pardon their crimes!
JER.18.23	Do not ignore their sins as though you had erased them!
JER.18.23	Let them be brought down in defeat before you!
JER.18.23	Deal with them while you are still angry!
JER.19.1	 The 
JER.19.2	 Go out to the part of the Hinnom Valley which is near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate.
JER.19.3	 Say, ‘Listen to what the 
JER.19.4	 I will do so because these people
JER.19.5	 They have built places here
JER.19.6	 So I, the 
JER.19.7	 In this place I will thwart
JER.19.8	 I will make this city an object of horror, a thing to be hissed at. All who pass by it will be filled with horror and will hiss out their scorn
JER.19.9	 I will reduce the people of this city to desperate straits during the siege imposed on it by their enemies who are seeking to kill them. I will make them so desperate that they will eat the flesh of their own sons and daughters and the flesh of one another.”’”
JER.19.10	 The 
JER.19.11	 Tell them the 
JER.19.12	 I, the 
JER.19.13	 The houses in Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled by dead bodies
JER.19.14	 Then Jeremiah left Topheth where the 
JER.19.15	 “The 
JER.20.1	 Now Pashhur son of Immer heard Jeremiah prophesy these things. He was the priest who was chief of security
JER.20.2	 When he heard Jeremiah’s prophecy, he had the prophet flogged.
JER.20.3	 But the next day Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks. When he did, Jeremiah said to him, “The 
JER.20.4	 For the 
JER.20.5	 I will hand over all the wealth of this city to their enemies. I will hand over to them all the fruits of the labor of the people of this city and all their prized possessions, as well as all the treasures of the kings of Judah. Their enemies will seize it all as plunder
JER.20.6	 You, Pashhur, and all your household
JER.20.7	and I allowed you to do it.
JER.20.7	You overcame my resistance and prevailed over me.
JER.20.7	Now I have become a constant laughingstock.
JER.20.7	Everyone ridicules me.
JER.20.8	 For whenever I prophesy,
JER.20.8	“Violence and destruction are coming!”
JER.20.8	This message from the 
JER.20.8	an object of continual insults and derision.
JER.20.9	 Sometimes I think, “I will make no mention of his message.
JER.20.9	I will not speak as his messenger
JER.20.9	But then
JER.20.9	locked up inside of me, burning in my heart and soul.
JER.20.9	I grow weary of trying to hold it in;
JER.20.9	I cannot contain it.
JER.20.10	 I
JER.20.10	Those who would cause me terror are everywhere!
JER.20.10	They are saying, “Come on, let’s publicly denounce him!”
JER.20.10	All my so-called friends
JER.20.10	something that would lead to my downfall.
JER.20.10	They say, “Perhaps he can be enticed into slipping up,
JER.20.10	so we can prevail over
JER.20.11	 But the 
JER.20.11	Therefore those who persecute me will fail and will not prevail over me.
JER.20.11	They will be thoroughly disgraced because they did not succeed.
JER.20.11	Their disgrace will never be forgotten.
JER.20.12	 O 
JER.20.12	You see into people’s hearts and minds.
JER.20.12	Pay them back for what they have done
JER.20.12	because I trust you to vindicate my cause.
JER.20.13	 Sing to the 
JER.20.13	For he rescues the oppressed from the clutches of evildoers.
JER.20.14	 Cursed be the day I was born!
JER.20.14	May that day not be blessed when my mother gave birth to me.
JER.20.15	 Cursed be the man
JER.20.15	who made my father very glad
JER.20.15	when he brought him the news
JER.20.15	that a baby boy had been born to him!
JER.20.16	 May that man be like the cities
JER.20.16	that the 
JER.20.16	May he hear a cry of distress in the morning
JER.20.16	and a battle cry at noon.
JER.20.17	 For he did not kill me before I came from the womb,
JER.20.17	making my pregnant mother’s womb my grave forever.
JER.20.18	 Why did I ever come forth from my mother’s womb?
JER.20.18	All I experience is trouble and grief,
JER.20.18	and I spend my days in shame.
JER.21.1	 The 
JER.21.2	 “Please ask the 
JER.21.3	 Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah 
JER.21.4	 that the 
JER.21.5	 In anger, in fury, and in wrath I myself will fight against you with my mighty power and great strength!
JER.21.6	 I will kill everything living in Jerusalem,
JER.21.7	 Then
JER.21.8	 “But
JER.21.9	 Those who stay in this city will die in battle or of starvation or disease. Those who leave the city and surrender to the Babylonians who are besieging it will live. They will escape with their lives.
JER.21.10	 For I, the 
JER.21.11	 The 
JER.21.11	“Listen to what the 
JER.21.12	 O royal family descended from David.
JER.21.12	The 
JER.21.12	‘See to it that people each day
JER.21.12	Deliver those who have been robbed from those
JER.21.12	Otherwise, my wrath will blaze out against you.
JER.21.12	It will burn like a fire that cannot be put out
JER.21.12	because of the evil that you have done.
JER.21.13	 Listen, you
JER.21.13	I am opposed to you,’
JER.21.13	‘You boast, “No one can swoop down on us.
JER.21.13	No one can penetrate into our places of refuge.”
JER.21.14	 But I will punish you as your deeds deserve,’
JER.21.14	says the 
JER.21.14	‘I will set fire to your palace;
JER.21.14	it will burn up everything around it.’”
JER.22.1	 The 
JER.22.2	 Say: ‘Listen, O king of Judah who follows in David’s succession.
JER.22.3	 The 
JER.22.4	 If you are careful to
JER.22.5	 But, if you do not obey these commands, I solemnly swear
JER.22.6	 “‘For the 
JER.22.6	“This place looks like a veritable forest of Gilead to me.
JER.22.6	It is like the wooded heights of Lebanon in my eyes.
JER.22.6	But I swear that I will make it like a wilderness
JER.22.6	whose towns have all been deserted.
JER.22.7	 I will send men against it to destroy it
JER.22.7	with their axes and hatchets.
JER.22.7	They will hack up its fine cedar panels and columns
JER.22.7	and throw them into the fire.
JER.22.8	 “‘People from other nations will pass by this city. They will ask one another, “Why has the 
JER.22.9	 The answer will come back, “It is because they broke their covenant with the 
JER.22.10	 “‘Do not weep for the king who was killed.
JER.22.10	Do not grieve for him.
JER.22.10	But weep mournfully for the king who has gone into exile.
JER.22.10	For he will never return to see his native land again.
JER.22.11	 “‘For the 
JER.22.12	 For he will die in the country where they took him as a captive. He will never see this land again.”
JER.22.13	 “‘Sure to be judged

JER.22.13	He does not pay them for their labor.
JER.22.14	 He says, “I will build myself a large palace
JER.22.14	with spacious upper rooms.”
JER.22.14	He cuts windows in its walls,
JER.22.14	panels it
JER.22.15	 Does it make you any more of a king
JER.22.15	that you outstrip everyone else in
JER.22.15	Just think about your father.
JER.22.15	He was content that he had food and drink.
JER.22.15	He did what was just and right.
JER.22.15	So things went well with him.
JER.22.16	 He upheld the cause of the poor and needy.
JER.22.16	So things went well for Judah.’
JER.22.16	The 
JER.22.16	‘That is a good example of what it means to know me.’
JER.22.17	 But you are always thinking and looking
JER.22.17	for ways to increase your wealth by dishonest means.
JER.22.17	Your eyes and your heart are set 
JER.22.17	on killing some innocent person 
JER.22.17	and committing fraud and oppression.
JER.22.18	 So
JER.22.18	People will not mourn for him, saying,
JER.22.18	“This makes me sad, my brother! 
JER.22.18	This makes me sad, my sister!”
JER.22.18	They will not mourn for him, saying,
JER.22.18	“Poor, poor lord! Poor, poor majesty!”
JER.22.19	 He will be left unburied just like a dead donkey.
JER.22.19	His body will be dragged off and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.’”
JER.22.20	 People of Jerusalem,
JER.22.20	Go to the land of Bashan and cry out loudly.
JER.22.20	Cry out in mourning from the mountains of Moab.
JER.22.20	For your allies
JER.22.21	 While you were feeling secure I gave you warning.
JER.22.21	But you said, “I refuse to listen to you.”
JER.22.21	That is the way you have acted from your earliest history onward.
JER.22.21	Indeed, you have never paid attention to me.
JER.22.22	 My judgment will carry off all your leaders like a storm wind!
JER.22.22	Your allies will go into captivity.
JER.22.22	Then you will certainly
JER.22.22	because of all the wickedness you have done.
JER.22.23	 You may feel as secure as a bird
JER.22.23	nesting in the cedars of Lebanon.
JER.22.23	But oh how you
JER.22.23	They will be like those of a woman giving birth to a baby.
JER.22.24	 The 
JER.22.24	“As surely as I am the living God, you, Jeconiah,
JER.22.25	 I will hand you over to those who want to take your life and of whom you are afraid. I will hand you over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his Babylonian
JER.22.26	 I will force you and your mother who gave you birth into exile. You will be exiled to
JER.22.27	 You will never come back to this land to which you will long to return!”
JER.22.28	 This man, Jeconiah, will be like a broken pot someone threw away.
JER.22.28	He will be like a clay vessel
JER.22.28	Why will he and his children be forced into exile?
JER.22.28	Why will they be thrown out into a country they know nothing about?
JER.22.29	 O land of Judah, land of Judah, land of Judah!
JER.22.29	Listen to what the 
JER.22.30	 The 
JER.22.30	“Enroll this man in the register as though he were childless.
JER.22.30	Enroll him as a man who will not enjoy success during his lifetime.
JER.22.30	For none of his sons will succeed in occupying the throne of David
JER.22.30	or ever succeed in ruling over Judah.”
JER.23.1	 The 
JER.23.2	 So the 
JER.23.3	 Then I myself will regather those of my people
JER.23.4	 I will install rulers
JER.23.5	 “I, the 
JER.23.5	when I will raise up for them a righteous branch,
JER.23.5	He will rule over them with wisdom and understanding
JER.23.5	and will do what is just and right in the land.
JER.23.6	 Under his rule
JER.23.6	and Israel will live in security.
JER.23.6	This is the name he will go by:
JER.23.6	‘The 
JER.23.7	 “So I, the 
JER.23.8	 But at that time they will affirm them with “I swear as surely as the 
JER.23.9	 Here is what the 
JER.23.9	My heart and my mind are deeply disturbed.
JER.23.9	I tremble all over.
JER.23.9	I am like a drunk person,
JER.23.9	like a person who has had too much wine,
JER.23.9	because of the way the 
JER.23.9	and his holy word are being mistreated.
JER.23.10	 For the land is full of people unfaithful to him.
JER.23.10	They live wicked lives and they misuse their power.
JER.23.10	So the land is dried up
JER.23.10	The pastures in the wilderness are withered.
JER.23.11	 Moreover,
JER.23.11	“Both the prophets and priests are godless.
JER.23.11	I have even found them doing evil in my temple!
JER.23.12	 So the paths they follow will be dark and slippery.
JER.23.12	They will stumble and fall headlong.
JER.23.12	For I will bring disaster on them.
JER.23.12	A day of reckoning is coming for them.”
JER.23.12	The 
JER.23.13	 The 
JER.23.13	doing something that was disgusting.
JER.23.13	They prophesied in the name of the god Baal
JER.23.13	and led my people Israel astray.
JER.23.14	 But I see the prophets of Jerusalem
JER.23.14	doing something just as shocking.
JER.23.14	They are unfaithful to me 
JER.23.14	and continually prophesy lies.
JER.23.14	So they give encouragement to people who are doing evil,
JER.23.14	with the result that they do not stop their evildoing.
JER.23.14	I consider all of them as bad as the people of Sodom,
JER.23.14	and the citizens of Jerusalem as bad as the people of Gomorrah.
JER.23.15	 So then I, the 
JER.23.15	have something to say concerning the prophets of Jerusalem:
JER.23.15	‘I will make these prophets eat the bitter food of suffering 
JER.23.15	and drink the poison water of judgment.
JER.23.15	For the prophets of Jerusalem are the reason
JER.23.15	that ungodliness
JER.23.16	 The 
JER.23.16	“Do not listen to what
JER.23.16	those prophets are saying to you.
JER.23.16	They are filling you with false hopes.
JER.23.16	They are reporting visions of their own imaginations,
JER.23.16	not something the 
JER.23.17	 They continually say
JER.23.17	‘Things will go well for you!’
JER.23.17	They say to all those who follow the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts,
JER.23.17	‘Nothing bad will happen to you!’
JER.23.18	 Yet which of them has ever stood in the 
JER.23.18	so they
JER.23.18	Which of them have ever paid attention or listened to what he has said?
JER.23.19	 But just watch!
JER.23.19	will come like a storm!
JER.23.19	Like a raging storm it will rage down
JER.23.19	on the heads of those who are wicked.
JER.23.20	 The anger of the 
JER.23.20	until he has fully carried out his intended purposes.
JER.23.20	In days to come
JER.23.20	you people will come to understand this clearly.
JER.23.21	 I did not send those prophets.
JER.23.21	Yet they were in a hurry to give their message.
JER.23.21	I did not tell them anything.
JER.23.21	Yet they prophesied anyway.
JER.23.22	 But if they had stood in my inner circle,
JER.23.22	they would have proclaimed my message to my people.
JER.23.22	They would have caused my people to turn from their wicked ways
JER.23.22	and stop doing the evil things they are doing.
JER.23.23	 Do you people think
JER.23.23	and not the transcendent God?”
JER.23.24	 “Do you really think anyone can hide himself
JER.23.24	where I cannot see him?” the 
JER.23.24	“Do you not know that I am everywhere?”
JER.23.24	the 
JER.23.25	 The 
JER.23.26	 Those prophets are just prophesying lies. They are prophesying the delusions of their own minds.
JER.23.27	 How long will they go on plotting
JER.23.28	 Let the prophet who has had a dream go ahead and tell his dream. Let the person who has received my message report that message faithfully. What is like straw cannot compare to what is like grain!
JER.23.29	 My message is like a fire that purges dross!
JER.23.30	 So I, the 
JER.23.31	 I, the 
JER.23.32	 I, the 
JER.23.33	 The 
JER.23.34	 I will punish any prophet, priest, or other person who says “The 
JER.23.35	 So I, Jeremiah, tell you,
JER.23.36	 You must no longer say that the 
JER.23.37	 Each of you should merely ask the prophet, ‘What answer did the 
JER.23.38	 But just suppose you continue to say, ‘The message of the 
JER.23.39	 So
JER.23.40	 I will bring on you lasting shame and lasting disgrace which will never be forgotten!’”
JER.24.1	 The 
JER.24.2	 One basket had very good-looking figs in it. They looked like those that had ripened early.
JER.24.3	 The 
JER.24.4	 The 
JER.24.5	 “I, the 
JER.24.6	 I will look after their welfare
JER.24.7	 I will give them the desire to acknowledge that I
JER.24.8	 “I, the 
JER.24.9	 I will bring such disaster on them that all the kingdoms of the earth will be horrified. I will make them an object of reproach, a proverbial example of disaster. I will make them an object of ridicule, an example to be used in curses.
JER.24.10	 I will bring war, starvation, and disease
JER.25.1	 In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the 
JER.25.2	 So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the people who were living in Jerusalem.
JER.25.3	 “For the last twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was ruling in Judah
JER.25.4	 Over and over again
JER.25.5	 He said through them,
JER.25.6	 Do not pay allegiance to
JER.25.7	 So, now the 
JER.25.8	 “Therefore, the 
JER.25.9	 So I, the 
JER.25.10	 I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness, to the glad celebration of brides and grooms in these lands.
JER.25.11	 This whole area
JER.25.12	 “‘But when the seventy years are over, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation
JER.25.13	 I will bring on that land everything that I said I would. I will bring on it everything that is written in this book. I will bring on it everything that Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
JER.25.14	 For many nations and great kings will make slaves of the king of Babylon and his nation
JER.25.15	 So
JER.25.16	 When they have drunk it, they will stagger to and fro
JER.25.17	 So I took the cup from the 
JER.25.18	 I made Jerusalem
JER.25.19	 I made all of these other people drink it: Pharaoh, king of Egypt;
JER.25.20	 the foreigners living in Egypt;
JER.25.21	 all the people of Edom,
JER.25.22	 all the kings of Tyre,
JER.25.23	 the people of Dedan, Tema, Buz,
JER.25.24	 all the kings of Arabia who
JER.25.25	 all the kings of Zimri;
JER.25.26	 all the kings of the north, whether near or far from one another; and all the other kingdoms which are on the face of the earth. After all of them have drunk the wine of the 
JER.25.27	 Then the 
JER.25.28	 If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink it, tell them that the 
JER.25.29	 For take note, I am already beginning to bring disaster on the city that I call my own.
JER.25.30	 “Then, Jeremiah,
JER.25.30	‘Like a lion about to attack,
JER.25.30	from his holy dwelling on high he will roar loudly.
JER.25.30	He will roar mightily against his land.
JER.25.30	He will shout in triumph like those stomping juice from the grapes
JER.25.30	against all those who live on the earth.
JER.25.31	 The sounds of battle
JER.25.31	For the 
JER.25.31	He will pass judgment on all humankind
JER.25.31	and will hand the wicked over to be killed in war.’
JER.25.31	The 
JER.25.32	 The 
JER.25.32	‘Disaster will soon come on one nation after another.
JER.25.32	A mighty storm of military destruction
JER.25.32	from the distant parts of the earth.’
JER.25.33	 Those who have been killed by the 
JER.25.33	will be scattered from one end of the earth to the other. 
JER.25.33	They will not be mourned over, gathered up, or buried.
JER.25.33	Their dead bodies will lie scattered over the ground like manure.
JER.25.34	 Wail and cry out in anguish, you rulers!
JER.25.34	Roll in the dust, you who shepherd flocks of people!
JER.25.34	The time for you to be slaughtered has come.
JER.25.34	You will lie scattered and fallen like broken pieces of fine pottery.
JER.25.35	 The leaders will not be able to run away and hide.
JER.25.35	The shepherds of the flocks will not be able to escape.
JER.25.36	 Listen to the cries of anguish of the leaders.
JER.25.36	Listen to the wails of the shepherds of the flocks.
JER.25.36	They are wailing because the 
JER.25.36	is about to destroy their lands.
JER.25.37	 Their peaceful dwelling places will be laid waste
JER.25.37	by the fierce anger of the 
JER.25.38	 The 
JER.25.38	So their lands will certainly
JER.25.38	by the warfare of the oppressive nation
JER.25.38	and by the fierce anger of the 
JER.26.1	 The 
JER.26.2	 The 
JER.26.3	 Maybe they will pay attention and each of them will stop living the evil way they do.
JER.26.4	 Tell them that the 
JER.26.5	 You must pay attention to the exhortations of my servants the prophets. I have sent them to you over and over again.
JER.26.6	 If you do not obey me,
JER.26.7	 The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah say these things in the 
JER.26.8	 Jeremiah had just barely finished saying all the 
JER.26.9	 How dare you claim the 
JER.26.10	 However, some of the officials
JER.26.11	 Then the priests and the prophets made their charges before the officials and all the people. They said,
JER.26.12	 Then Jeremiah made his defense before all the officials and all the people.
JER.26.13	 But correct the way you have been living and do what is right.
JER.26.14	 As to my case, I am in your power.
JER.26.15	 But you should take careful note of this: If you put me to death, you will bring on yourselves and this city and those who live in it the guilt of murdering an innocent man. For the 
JER.26.16	 Then the officials and all the people rendered their verdict to the priests and the prophets. They said,
JER.26.17	 Then some of the elders of Judah
JER.26.18	 “Micah from Moresheth
JER.26.18	‘The 
JER.26.18	“Zion
JER.26.18	Jerusalem
JER.26.18	The temple mount will become a mere wooded ridge.”’
JER.26.19	 King Hezekiah and all the people of Judah did not put him to death, did they? Did not Hezekiah show reverence for the 
JER.26.20	 Now there was another man
JER.26.21	 When the king and all his bodyguards
JER.26.22	 However, King Jehoiakim sent some men to Egypt, including Elnathan son of Achbor,
JER.26.23	 and they brought Uriah back from there.
JER.26.24	 However, Ahikam son of Shaphan
JER.27.1	 The 
JER.27.2	 The 
JER.27.3	 Use it to send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre,
JER.27.4	 Charge them to give their masters a message from me. Tell them, ‘The 
JER.27.5	 “I made the earth and the people and animals on it by my mighty power and great strength,
JER.27.6	 I have at this time placed all these nations of yours under the power

JER.27.8	 But suppose a nation or a kingdom will not be subject to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Suppose it will not submit to the yoke of servitude to
JER.27.9	 So do not listen to your prophets or to those who claim to predict the future by divination,

JER.27.11	 Things will go better for the nation that submits to the yoke of servitude to
JER.27.12	 I told King Zedekiah of Judah the same thing. I said,
JER.27.13	 There is no reason why you and your people should die in war
JER.27.14	 Do not listen to the prophets who are telling you that you do not need to serve
JER.27.15	 For I, the 
JER.27.16	 I also told the priests and all the people, “The 
JER.27.17	 Do not listen to them. Be subject to the king of Babylon. Then you
JER.27.18	 I also told them,
JER.27.19	 For the 
JER.27.20	 He has already spoken about these things that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiakim’s son King Jeconiah of Judah and the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem away as captives.
JER.27.21	 Indeed, the 
JER.27.22	 He has said, ‘They will be carried off to Babylon. They will remain there until it is time for me to show consideration for them again.
JER.28.1	 The following events occurred in that same year, early in the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah. To be more precise, it was the fifth month of the fourth year of his reign.
JER.28.2	 “The 
JER.28.3	 Before two years are over, I will bring back to this place everything that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took from it and carried away to Babylon. 
JER.28.4	 I will also bring back to this place Jehoiakim’s son King Jeconiah of Judah and all the exiles who were taken to Babylon.’ Indeed, the 
JER.28.5	 Then the prophet Jeremiah responded to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the 
JER.28.6	 The prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the 
JER.28.7	 But listen to what I say to you and to all these people.
JER.28.8	 From earliest times, the prophets who preceded you and me invariably
JER.28.9	 So if a prophet prophesied
JER.28.10	 The prophet Hananiah then took the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck and broke it. 
JER.28.11	 Then he spoke up in the presence of all the people. “The 
JER.28.12	 But shortly after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, the 
JER.28.13	 “Go and tell Hananiah that the

JER.28.15	 Then the prophet Jeremiah told the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The 
JER.28.16	 So the 
JER.28.17	 In the seventh month of that very same year
JER.29.1	 The prophet Jeremiah sent a letter to the exiles Nebuchadnezzar had carried off from Jerusalem
JER.29.2	 He sent it after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the palace officials,
JER.29.3	 He sent it with Elasah son of Shaphan
JER.29.4	 “The 
JER.29.5	 ‘Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what they produce. 
JER.29.6	 Marry and have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons and allow your daughters get married so that they too can have sons and daughters. Grow in number; do not dwindle away. 
JER.29.7	 Work to see that the city where I sent you as exiles enjoys peace and prosperity. Pray to the 
JER.29.8	 “For the 
JER.29.9	 They are prophesying lies to you and claiming my authority to do so.
JER.29.10	 “For the 
JER.29.11	 For I know what I have planned for you,’ says the 
JER.29.12	 When you call out to me and come to me in prayer,
JER.29.13	 When you seek me in prayer and worship, you will find me available to you. If you seek me with all your heart and soul,

JER.29.16	 But just listen to what the 
JER.29.17	 The 
JER.29.18	 I will chase after them with war,

JER.29.27	 You should have reprimanded Jeremiah from Anathoth who is pretending to be a prophet among you!
JER.29.28	 For he has even sent a message to us here in Babylon. He wrote and told us,

JER.30.5	there is no peace in sight.
JER.30.6	 Ask yourselves this and consider it carefully:

JER.30.6	Why then do I see all these strong men
JER.30.6	grabbing their stomachs in pain like

JER.30.6	turn so deathly pale?
JER.30.7	 Alas, what a terrible time of trouble it is!
JER.30.7	There has never been any like it.
JER.30.7	It is a time of trouble for the descendants of Jacob,
JER.30.7	but some of them will be rescued out of it.
JER.30.8	 When the time for them to be rescued comes,”
JER.30.8	says the 
JER.30.8	“I will rescue you from foreign subjugation.
JER.30.8	I will deliver you from captivity.
JER.30.8	Foreigners will then no longer subjugate them.
JER.30.9	 But they will be subject

JER.30.10	 So I, the

JER.30.10	Do not be terrified, people of Israel.

JER.30.11	I will completely destroy all the nations where I scattered you.
JER.30.11	But I will not completely destroy you.
JER.30.11	I will indeed discipline you, but only in due measure.
JER.30.11	I will not allow you to go entirely unpunished.”

JER.30.12	“Your injuries are incurable;
JER.30.12	your wounds are severe.

JER.30.14	I have chastened you cruelly.
JER.30.14	For your wickedness is so great
JER.30.14	and your sin is so much.
JER.30.15	 Why do you complain about your injuries,
JER.30.15	that your pain is incurable?
JER.30.15	I have done all this to you
JER.30.15	because your wickedness is so great
JER.30.15	and your sin is so much.
JER.30.16	 But
JER.30.16	All your enemies will go into exile.
JER.30.16	Those who plundered you will be plundered.

JER.32.9	 So I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel. I weighed out seven ounces of silver and gave it to him to pay for it.
JER.32.10	 I signed the deed of purchase,
JER.32.11	 There were two copies of the deed of purchase. One was sealed and contained the order of transfer and the conditions of purchase.
JER.32.12	 I took both copies of the deed of purchase

JER.32.21	 You used your mighty power and your great strength to perform miracles and amazing deeds and to bring great terror on the Egyptians. By this means you brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt.
JER.32.22	 You kept the promise that you swore on oath to their ancestors.
JER.32.23	 But when they came in and took possession of it, they did not obey you or live as you had instructed them. They did not do anything that you commanded them to do.
JER.32.24	 Even now siege ramps have been built up around the city
JER.32.25	 The city is sure to fall into the hands of the Babylonians.

JER.32.31	 This will happen because
JER.32.32	 I am determined to do so because the people of Israel and Judah have made me angry with all their wickedness – they, their kings, their officials, their priests, their prophets, and especially the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem
JER.32.33	 They have turned away from me instead of turning to me.
JER.32.34	 They set up their disgusting idols in the temple which I have claimed for my own
JER.32.35	 They built places of worship for the god Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom so that they could sacrifice their sons and daughters to the god Molech.
JER.32.36	 “You and your people

JER.32.41	 I will take delight in doing good to them. I will faithfully and wholeheartedly plant them

JER.33.22	 I will make the children who follow one another in the line of my servant David very numerous. I will also make the Levites who minister before me very numerous. I will make them all as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sands which are on the seashore.’”

JER.33.24	 “You have surely noticed what these people are saying, haven’t you? They are saying,
JER.33.25	 But I, the 
JER.33.26	 Just as surely as I have done this, so surely will I never reject the descendants of Jacob. Nor will I ever refuse to choose one of my servant David’s descendants to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Indeed,

JER.34.2	 The 
JER.34.3	 You yourself will not escape his clutches, but will certainly be captured and handed over to him. You must confront the king of Babylon face to face and answer to him personally.
JER.34.4	 However, listen to what I, the 
JER.34.5	 You will die a peaceful death. They will burn incense at your burial just as they did at the burial of your ancestors, the former kings who preceded you.
JER.34.6	 The prophet Jeremiah told all this to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem. 
JER.34.7	 He did this while the army of the king of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and the cities of Lachish and Azekah. He was attacking these cities because they were the only fortified cities of Judah which were still holding out.
JER.34.8	 The 
JER.34.9	 Everyone was supposed to free their male and female Hebrew slaves. No one was supposed to keep a fellow Judean enslaved.
JER.34.10	 All the people and their leaders had agreed to this. They had agreed to free their male and female slaves and not keep them enslaved any longer. They originally complied with the covenant and freed them.
JER.34.11	 But later
JER.34.12	 That was when the 
JER.34.13	 “The 
JER.34.14	 “Every seven years each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you for six years, you shall set them free.”
JER.34.15	 Recently, however, you yourselves
JER.34.16	 But then you turned right around
JER.34.17	 So I, the 
JER.34.18	 I will punish those people who have violated their covenant with me. I will make them like the calf they cut in two and passed between its pieces.
JER.34.19	 I will punish the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials,
JER.34.20	 I will hand them over to their enemies who want to kill them. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.
JER.34.21	 I will also hand King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials over to their enemies who want to kill them. I will hand them over to the army of the king of Babylon, even though they have temporarily withdrawn from attacking you.
JER.34.22	 For I, the 
JER.35.1	 The 
JER.35.2	 “Go to the Rechabite community.
JER.35.3	 So I went and got Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah the grandson of Habazziniah, his brothers, all his sons, and all the rest of the Rechabite community. 
JER.35.4	 I took them to the 
JER.35.5	 Then I set cups and pitchers full of wine in front of the members of the Rechabite community and said to them, “Have some wine.”
JER.35.6	 But they answered, “We do not drink wine because our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us not to. He told us, ‘You and your children must never drink wine. 
JER.35.7	 Do not build houses. Do not plant crops. Do not plant a vineyard or own one.
JER.35.8	 We and our wives and our sons and daughters have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. We have never drunk wine.
JER.35.9	 We have not built any houses to live in. We do not own any vineyards, fields, or crops. 
JER.35.10	 We have lived in tents. We have obeyed our ancestor Jonadab and done exactly as he commanded us.
JER.35.11	 But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded the land we said, ‘Let’s get up and go to Jerusalem
JER.35.12	 Then the 
JER.35.13	 The 
JER.35.14	 Jonadab son of Rechab ordered his descendants not to drink wine. His orders have been carried out.
JER.35.15	 I sent all my servants the prophets to warn you over and over again. They said, “Every one of you, stop doing the evil things you have been doing and do what is right.
JER.35.16	 Yes,
JER.35.17	 So I, the 
JER.35.18	 Then Jeremiah spoke to the Rechabite community, “The 
JER.35.19	 So the 
JER.36.1	 The 
JER.36.2	 “Get a scroll.
JER.36.3	 Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the disaster I intend to bring on them, they will all stop doing the evil things they have been doing.
JER.36.4	 So Jeremiah summoned Baruch son of Neriah. Then Jeremiah dictated to Baruch everything the 
JER.36.5	 Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am no longer allowed to go
JER.36.6	 So you go there the next time all the people of Judah come in from their towns to fast
JER.36.7	 Perhaps then they will ask the 
JER.36.8	 So Baruch son of Neriah did exactly what the prophet Jeremiah had told him to do. He read what the 
JER.36.9	 All the people living in Jerusalem
JER.36.10	 At that time Baruch went into the temple of the 
JER.36.11	 Micaiah, who was the son of Gemariah and the grandson of Shaphan, heard Baruch read from the scroll everything the 
JER.36.12	 He went down to the chamber of the royal secretary in the king’s palace and found all the court officials in session there. Elishama
JER.36.13	 Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.
JER.36.14	 All the officials sent Jehudi, who was the son of Nethaniah and the grandson of Cushi, to Baruch. They ordered him to tell Baruch, “Come here and bring with you
JER.36.15	 They said to him, “Please sit down and read it to us.” So Baruch sat down and read it to them.
JER.36.16	 When they had heard it all,
JER.36.17	 Then they asked Baruch, “How did you come to write all these words? Do they actually come from Jeremiah’s mouth?”
JER.36.18	 Baruch answered, “Yes, they came from his own mouth. He dictated all these words to me and I wrote them down in ink on this scroll.”
JER.36.19	 Then the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah must go and hide. You must not let anyone know where you are.”
JER.36.20	 The officials put the scroll in the room of Elishama, the royal secretary, for safekeeping.
JER.36.21	 The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. He went and got it from the room of Elishama, the royal secretary. Then he himself
JER.36.22	 Since it was the ninth month of the year, the king was sitting in his winter quarters.
JER.36.23	 As soon as Jehudi had read three or four columns
JER.36.24	 Neither he nor any of his attendants showed any alarm when they heard all that had been read. Nor did they tear their clothes to show any grief or sorrow.
JER.36.25	 The king did not even listen to Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah, who had urged him not to burn the scroll.
JER.36.26	 He also ordered Jerahmeel, who was one of the royal princes,
JER.36.27	 The 
JER.36.28	 “Get another
JER.36.29	 Tell King Jehoiakim of Judah, ‘The 
JER.36.30	 So the 
JER.36.31	 I will punish him and his descendants and the officials who serve him for the wicked things they have done.
JER.36.32	 Then Jeremiah got another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah. As Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on this scroll everything that had been on the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned in the fire. They also added on this scroll several other messages of the same kind.
JER.37.1	 Zedekiah son of Josiah succeeded Jeconiah
JER.37.2	 Neither he nor the officials who served him nor the people of Judah paid any attention to what the 
JER.37.3	 King Zedekiah sent
JER.37.4	 (Now Jeremiah had not yet been put in prison.
JER.37.5	 At that time the Babylonian forces
JER.37.6	 The 
JER.37.7	 “The 
JER.37.8	 Then the Babylonian forces
JER.37.9	 Moreover, I, the 
JER.37.10	 For even if you were to defeat all the Babylonian forces
JER.37.11	 The following events also occurred
JER.37.12	 Jeremiah started to leave Jerusalem to go to the territory of Benjamin. He wanted to make sure he got his share of the property that was being divided up among his family there.
JER.37.13	 But he only got as far as the Benjamin Gate.
JER.37.14	 Jeremiah answered, “That’s a lie! I am not deserting to the Babylonians.”
JER.37.15	 The officials were very angry
JER.37.16	 So
JER.37.17	 Then King Zedekiah had him brought to the palace. There he questioned him privately and asked him,
JER.37.18	 Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against you, or the officials who serve you, or the people of Judah? What have I done to make you people throw me into prison?
JER.37.19	 Where now are the prophets who prophesied to you that
JER.37.20	 But now please listen, your royal Majesty,
JER.37.21	 Then King Zedekiah ordered that Jeremiah be committed to the courtyard of the guardhouse. He also ordered that a loaf of bread
JER.38.1	 Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal
JER.38.2	 “The 
JER.38.3	 They had also heard him say,
JER.38.4	 So these officials said to the king, “This man must be put to death. For he is demoralizing
JER.38.5	 King Zedekiah said to them, “Very well, you can do what you want with him.
JER.38.6	 So the officials
JER.38.7	 An Ethiopian, Ebed Melech,
JER.38.8	 Ebed Melech departed the palace and went to speak to the king. He said to him, 
JER.38.9	 “Your royal Majesty, those men have been very wicked in all that they have done to the prophet Jeremiah. They have thrown him into a cistern and he is sure to die of starvation there because there is no food left in the city.
JER.38.10	 Then the king gave Ebed Melech the Ethiopian the following order: “Take thirty
JER.38.11	 So Ebed Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasure room in the palace.
JER.38.12	 Ebed Melech
JER.38.13	 So they pulled Jeremiah up from the cistern with ropes. Jeremiah, however, still remained confined
JER.38.14	 Some time later
JER.38.15	 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I answer you, you will certainly kill me.
JER.38.16	 So King Zedekiah made a secret promise to Jeremiah and sealed it with an oath. He promised,
JER.38.17	 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “The 
JER.38.18	 But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians
JER.38.19	 Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Babylonians.
JER.38.20	 Then Jeremiah answered, “You will not be handed over to them. Please obey the 
JER.38.21	 But if you refuse to surrender, the 
JER.38.22	 All the women who are left in the royal palace of Judah will be led out to the officers of the king of Babylon. They will taunt you saying,
JER.38.22	‘Your trusted friends misled you; 
JER.38.22	they have gotten the best of you.
JER.38.22	Now that your feet are stuck in the mud,
JER.38.22	they have turned their backs on you.’
JER.38.23	 “All your wives and your children will be turned over to the Babylonians.
JER.38.24	 Then Zedekiah told Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about the conversation we have had.
JER.38.25	 The officials may hear that I have talked with you. They may come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you.
JER.38.26	 If they do this, tell
JER.38.27	 All the officials did indeed come and question Jeremiah.
JER.38.28	 So Jeremiah remained confined
JER.38.28	The following events occurred when Jerusalem
JER.39.1	 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it. The siege began in the tenth month of the ninth year that Zedekiah ruled over Judah.
JER.39.2	 It lasted until the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
JER.39.3	 Then Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim, who was a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer, who was a high official,
JER.39.4	 When King Zedekiah of Judah and all his soldiers saw them, they tried to escape. They departed from the city during the night. They took a path through the king’s garden and passed out through the gate between the two walls.
JER.39.5	 But the Babylonian
JER.39.6	 There at Riblah the king of Babylon had Zedekiah’s sons put to death while Zedekiah was forced to watch. The king of Babylon also had all the nobles of Judah put to death. 
JER.39.7	 Then he had Zedekiah’s eyes put out and had him bound in chains
JER.39.8	 The Babylonians
JER.39.9	 Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard,
JER.39.10	 But he
JER.39.11	 Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had issued orders concerning Jeremiah. He had passed them on through Nebuzaradan, the captain of his royal guard,
JER.39.12	 “Find Jeremiah
JER.39.13	 So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, Nebushazban, who was a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer, who was a high official,
JER.39.14	 sent and had Jeremiah brought from the courtyard of the guardhouse. They turned him over to Gedaliah,
JER.39.15	 Now the 
JER.39.16	 “Go
JER.39.17	 But I will rescue you when it happens.
JER.39.18	 I will certainly save you. You will not fall victim to violence.
JER.40.1	 The 
JER.40.2	 The captain of the royal guard took Jeremiah aside and said to him, “The 
JER.40.3	 Now he has brought it about. The 
JER.40.4	 But now, Jeremiah, today I will set you free
JER.40.5	 Before Jeremiah could turn to leave, the captain of the guard added, “Go back
JER.40.6	 So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah
JER.40.7	 Now some of the officers of the Judean army and their troops had been hiding in the countryside. They heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam to govern
JER.40.8	 So
JER.40.9	 Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, took an oath so as to give them and their troops some assurance of safety.
JER.40.10	 I for my part will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians
JER.40.11	 Moreover, all the Judeans who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and all the other countries heard what had happened. They heard that the king of Babylon had allowed some people to stay in Judah and that he had appointed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to govern them. 
JER.40.12	 So all these Judeans returned to the land of Judah from the places where they had been scattered. They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Thus they harvested a large amount of wine and dates and figs.
JER.40.13	 Johanan and all the officers of the troops that had been hiding in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. 
JER.40.14	 They said to him, “Are you at all aware
JER.40.15	 Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah there at Mizpah, “Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah before anyone knows about it. Otherwise he will kill you
JER.40.16	 But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Do not do that
JER.41.1	 But in the seventh month
JER.41.2	 Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him stood up, pulled out their swords, and killed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. Thus Ishmael killed the man that the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the country. 
JER.41.3	 Ishmael also killed all the Judeans
JER.41.4	 On the day after Gedaliah had been murdered, before anyone even knew about it, 
JER.41.5	 eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria.
JER.41.6	 Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them. He was pretending to cry
JER.41.7	 But as soon as they were inside the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw their bodies
JER.41.8	 But there were ten men among them who said
JER.41.9	 Now the cistern where Ishmael threw all the dead bodies of those he had killed was a large one
JER.41.10	 Then Ishmael took captive all the people who were still left alive in Mizpah. This included the royal princesses
JER.41.11	 Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the atrocities
JER.41.12	 So they took all their troops and went to fight against Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the large pool
JER.41.13	 When all the people that Ishmael had taken captive saw
JER.41.14	 All those people that Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	 But Ishmael son of Nethaniah managed to escape from Johanan along with eight of his men, and he went on over to Ammon.
JER.41.16	 Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led off all the people who had been left alive at Mizpah. They had rescued them from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after he killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. They led off the men, women, children, soldiers, and court officials whom they had brought away from Gibeon. 
JER.41.17	 They set out to go to Egypt to get away from the Babylonians,
JER.41.18	 They were afraid of what the Babylonians might do
JER.42.1	 Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah
JER.42.2	 They said to him, “Please grant our request
JER.42.3	 Pray that the 
JER.42.4	 The prophet Jeremiah answered them, “Agreed!
JER.42.5	 They answered Jeremiah, “May the 
JER.42.6	 We will obey what the 
JER.42.7	 Ten days later the 
JER.42.8	 So Jeremiah summoned Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people of every class.
JER.42.9	 Then Jeremiah said to them, “You sent me to the 
JER.42.10	 ‘If you will just stay
JER.42.11	 Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you now fear.
JER.42.12	 I will have compassion on you so that he in turn will have mercy on you and allow you to return to your land.’
JER.42.13	 “You must not disobey the 
JER.42.14	 You must not say, ‘No, we will not stay. Instead we will go and live in the land of Egypt where we will not face war,
JER.42.15	 If you people who remain in Judah do that, then listen to what the 
JER.42.16	 the wars you fear will catch up with you there in the land of Egypt. The starvation you are worried about will follow you there to
JER.42.17	 All the people who are determined to go and settle in Egypt will die from war, starvation, or disease. No one will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.’ 
JER.42.18	 For
JER.42.19	 “The 
JER.42.20	 You are making a fatal mistake.
JER.42.21	 This day
JER.42.22	 So now be very sure of this: You will die from war, starvation, or disease in the place where you want to go and live.”
JER.43.1	 Jeremiah finished telling all the people all these things the 
JER.43.2	 Then Azariah
JER.43.3	 But Baruch son of Neriah is stirring you up against us.
JER.43.4	 So Johanan son of Kareah, all the army officers, and all the rest of the people did not obey the 
JER.43.5	 Instead Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led off all the Judean remnant who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered.
JER.43.6	 They also led off all the men, women, children, and royal princesses
JER.43.7	 They went on to Egypt
JER.43.8	 At Tahpanhes the 
JER.43.9	 “Take some large stones
JER.43.10	 Then tell them,
JER.43.11	 He will come and attack Egypt. Those who are destined to die of disease will die of disease. Those who are destined to be carried off into exile will be carried off into exile. Those who are destined to die in war will die in war.
JER.43.12	 He will set fire
JER.43.13	 He will demolish the sacred pillars in the temple of the sun
JER.44.1	 The 
JER.44.2	 “The 
JER.44.3	 This happened because of the wickedness the people living there did.
JER.44.4	 I sent my servants the prophets to you people over and over
JER.44.5	 But the people of Jerusalem and Judah
JER.44.6	 So my anger and my wrath were poured out and burned like a fire through the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. That is why they have become the desolate ruins that they are today.’
JER.44.7	 “So now the 
JER.44.8	 That is what will result from your making me angry by what you are doing.
JER.44.9	 Have you forgotten all the wicked things that have been done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem by your ancestors, by the kings of Judah and their
JER.44.10	 To this day your people
JER.44.11	 “Because of this, the 
JER.44.12	 I will see to it that all the Judean remnant that was determined to go
JER.44.13	 I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt with war, starvation, and disease just as I punished Jerusalem. 
JER.44.14	 None of the Judean remnant who have come to live in the land of Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah. Though they long to return and live there, none of them shall return except a few fugitives.’”
JER.44.15	 Then all the men who were aware that their wives were sacrificing to other gods, as well as all their wives, answered Jeremiah. There was a great crowd of them representing all the people who lived in northern and southern Egypt.
JER.44.16	 “We will not listen to what you claim the 
JER.44.17	 Instead we will do everything we vowed we would do.
JER.44.18	 But ever since we stopped sacrificing and pouring out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven, we have been in great need. Our people have died in wars or of starvation.”
JER.44.19	 The women added,
JER.44.20	 Then Jeremiah replied to all the people, both men and women, who responded to him in this way.
JER.44.21	 “The 
JER.44.22	 Finally the 
JER.44.23	 You have sacrificed to other gods! You have sinned against the 
JER.44.24	 Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people, particularly to all the women.
JER.44.25	 The 
JER.44.26	 But
JER.44.27	 I will indeed
JER.44.28	 Some who survive in battle will return to the land of Judah from the land of Egypt. But they will be very few indeed!
JER.44.29	 Moreover the 
JER.44.30	 I, the 
JER.45.1	 The prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah while he was writing down in a scroll the words that Jeremiah spoke to him.
JER.45.2	 “The 
JER.45.3	 ‘You have said, “I feel so hopeless!
JER.45.4	 The 
JER.45.5	 Are you looking for great things for yourself? Do not look for such things. For I, the 
JER.46.1	 The 
JER.46.2	 He spoke about Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt which was encamped along the Euphrates River at Carchemish. Now this was the army that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon defeated in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling
JER.46.3	 “Fall into ranks with your shields ready!
JER.46.3	Prepare to march into battle!
JER.46.4	 Harness the horses to the chariots!
JER.46.4	Mount your horses!
JER.46.4	Put on your helmets and take your positions!
JER.46.4	Sharpen you spears!
JER.46.4	Put on your armor!
JER.46.5	 What do I see?”
JER.46.5	“The soldiers
JER.46.5	They are retreating.
JER.46.5	They have been defeated.
JER.46.5	They are overcome with terror;
JER.46.5	they desert quickly
JER.46.5	without looking back.
JER.46.6	 But even the swiftest cannot get away.
JER.46.6	Even the strongest cannot escape.
JER.46.6	There in the north by the Euphrates River
JER.46.6	they stumble and fall in defeat.
JER.46.7	 “Who is this that rises like the Nile,
JER.46.7	like its streams
JER.46.8	 Egypt rises like the Nile,
JER.46.8	like its streams turbulent at flood stage.
JER.46.8	Egypt says, ‘I will arise and cover the earth.
JER.46.8	I will destroy cities and the people who inhabit them.’
JER.46.9	 Go ahead and
JER.46.9	Drive furiously, you charioteers!
JER.46.9	Let the soldiers march out into battle,
JER.46.9	those from Ethiopia and Libya who carry shields,
JER.46.9	and those from Lydia
JER.46.10	 But that day belongs to the Lord God who rules over all.
JER.46.10	It is the day when he will pay back his enemies.
JER.46.10	His sword will devour them until its appetite is satisfied!
JER.46.10	It will drink their blood until it is full!
JER.46.10	For the Lord 
JER.46.10	in the land of the north by the Euphrates River.
JER.46.11	 Go up to Gilead and get medicinal ointment,
JER.46.11	you dear poor people of Egypt.
JER.46.11	But it will prove useless no matter how much medicine you use;
JER.46.11	there will be no healing for you.
JER.46.12	 The nations will hear of your devastating defeat.
JER.46.12	your cries of distress will echo throughout the earth.
JER.46.12	In the panic of their flight one soldier will trip over another
JER.46.12	and both of them will fall down defeated.”
JER.46.13	 The 
JER.46.14	 “Make an announcement throughout Egypt.
JER.46.14	Proclaim it in Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpanhes.
JER.46.14	‘Take your positions and prepare to do battle.
JER.46.14	For the enemy army is destroying all the nations around you.’
JER.46.15	 Why will your soldiers
JER.46.15	They will not stand because I, the 
JER.46.16	 I will make many stumble.
JER.46.16	They will fall over one another in their hurry to flee.
JER.46.16	They will say, ‘Get up! 
JER.46.16	Let’s go back to our own people.
JER.46.16	Let’s go back to our homelands
JER.46.16	because the enemy is coming to destroy us.’
JER.46.17	 There at home they will say, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is just a big noise!
JER.46.17	He has let the most opportune moment pass by.’
JER.46.18	 I the King, whose name is the 
JER.46.18	I swear as surely as I live that
JER.46.18	He will be as imposing as Mount Tabor is among the mountains,
JER.46.18	as Mount Carmel is against the backdrop of the sea.
JER.46.19	 Pack your bags for exile,
JER.46.19	you inhabitants of poor dear Egypt.
JER.46.19	For Memphis will be laid waste.
JER.46.19	It will lie in ruins
JER.46.20	 Egypt is like a beautiful young cow.
JER.46.20	But northern armies will attack her like swarms of stinging flies.
JER.46.21	 Even her mercenaries
JER.46.21	will prove to be like pampered,
JER.46.21	For they too will turn and run away.
JER.46.21	They will not stand their ground 
JER.46.21	when
JER.46.21	the time for them to be punished.
JER.46.22	 Egypt will run away, hissing like a snake,
JER.46.22	as the enemy comes marching up in force.
JER.46.22	They will come against her with axes
JER.46.22	as if they were woodsmen chopping down trees.
JER.46.23	 The population of Egypt is like a vast, impenetrable forest.
JER.46.23	But I, the 
JER.46.23	For those who chop them down will be more numerous than locusts.
JER.46.23	They will be too numerous to count.
JER.46.24	 Poor dear Egypt
JER.46.24	She will be handed over to the people from the north.”
JER.46.25	 The 
JER.46.26	 I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar and his troops, who want to kill them. But later on, people will live in Egypt again as they did in former times. I, the 
JER.46.27	 “You descendants of Jacob, my servants,
JER.46.27	do not be terrified, people of Israel.
JER.46.27	For I will rescue you and your descendants
JER.46.27	from the faraway lands where you are captives.
JER.46.27	The descendants of Jacob will return to their land and enjoy peace.
JER.46.27	They will be secure and no one will terrify them.

JER.46.28	Though I completely destroy all the nations where I scatter you,
JER.46.28	I will not completely destroy you.
JER.46.28	I will indeed discipline you but only in due measure.
JER.46.28	I will not allow you to go entirely unpunished.”
JER.47.1	 The 
JER.47.2	 “Look! Enemies are gathering in the north like water rising in a river.
JER.47.2	They will be like an overflowing stream.
JER.47.2	They will overwhelm the whole country and everything in it like a flood.
JER.47.2	They will overwhelm the cities and their inhabitants.
JER.47.2	People will cry out in alarm.
JER.47.2	Everyone living in the country will cry out in pain.
JER.47.3	 Fathers will hear the hoofbeats of the enemies’ horses,
JER.47.3	the clatter of their chariots and the rumbling of their wheels.

JER.47.4	that remains for Tyre
JER.47.4	For I, the 
JER.47.4	that remnant that came from the island of Crete.

JER.47.5	you who remain of Philistia’s power?
JER.47.6	 How long will you cry out,
JER.47.6	how long will it be before you stop killing?
JER.47.6	Go back into your sheath!
JER.47.6	Stay there and rest!’
JER.47.7	 But how can it rest
JER.47.7	when I, the 
JER.47.7	I have ordered it to attack
JER.47.7	the people of Ashkelon and the seacoast.
JER.48.1	 The 
JER.48.1	“Sure to be judged is Nebo! Indeed,
JER.48.1	Kiriathaim
JER.48.1	Its fortress
JER.48.2	 People will not praise Moab any more.
JER.48.2	The enemy will capture Heshbon
JER.48.2	saying, ‘Come, let’s put an end to that nation!’
JER.48.2	City of Madmen, you will also be destroyed.
JER.48.2	A destructive army will march against you.
JER.48.3	 Cries of anguish will arise in Horonaim,
JER.48.3	‘Oh, the ruin and great destruction!’
JER.48.4	 “Moab will be crushed.
JER.48.4	Her children will cry out in distress.
JER.48.5	 Indeed they will climb the slopes of Luhith,
JER.48.5	weeping continually as they go.
JER.48.5	For on the road down to Horonaim 
JER.48.5	they will hear the cries of distress over the destruction.
JER.48.6	 They will hear, ‘Run! Save yourselves!
JER.48.6	Even if you must be like a lonely shrub in the desert!’
JER.48.7	 “Moab, you trust in the things you do and in your riches.
JER.48.7	So you too will be conquered.
JER.48.7	Your god Chemosh
JER.48.7	along with his priests and his officials.
JER.48.8	 The destroyer will come against every town.
JER.48.8	Not one town will escape.
JER.48.8	The towns in the valley will be destroyed.
JER.48.8	The cities on the high plain will be laid waste.
JER.48.8	I, the 
JER.48.9	 Set up a gravestone for Moab,
JER.48.9	for it will certainly be laid in ruins!
JER.48.9	Its cities will be laid waste
JER.48.9	and become uninhabited.”
JER.48.10	 A curse on anyone who is lax in doing the 
JER.48.10	A curse on anyone who keeps from carrying out his destruction!
JER.48.11	 “From its earliest days Moab has lived undisturbed.
JER.48.11	It has never been taken into exile.
JER.48.11	Its people are like wine allowed to settle undisturbed on its dregs,
JER.48.11	never poured out from one jar to another.
JER.48.11	They are like wine which tastes like it always did,
JER.48.11	whose aroma has remained unchanged.
JER.48.12	 But the time is coming when I will send
JER.48.12	men against Moab who will empty it out.
JER.48.12	They will empty the towns of their people,
JER.48.12	then will lay those towns in ruins.
JER.48.12	I, the 
JER.48.13	 The people of Moab will be disappointed by their god Chemosh.
JER.48.13	They will be as disappointed as the people of Israel were 
JER.48.13	when they put their trust in the calf god at Bethel.
JER.48.14	 How can you men of Moab say, ‘We are heroes,
JER.48.14	men who are mighty in battle?’
JER.48.15	 Moab will be destroyed. Its towns will be invaded.
JER.48.15	Its finest young men will be slaughtered.
JER.48.15	I, the King, the 
JER.48.16	 Moab’s destruction is at hand.
JER.48.16	Disaster will come on it quickly.
JER.48.17	 Mourn for that nation, all you nations living around it,
JER.48.17	all of you nations that know of its fame.
JER.48.17	Mourn and say, ‘Alas, its powerful influence has been broken!
JER.48.17	Its glory and power have been done away!’
JER.48.18	 Come down from your place of honor;
JER.48.18	sit on the dry ground,
JER.48.18	For the one who will destroy Moab will attack you;
JER.48.18	he will destroy your fortifications.
JER.48.19	 You who live in Aroer,
JER.48.19	stand by the road and watch.
JER.48.19	Question the man who is fleeing and the woman who is escaping.
JER.48.19	Ask them, ‘What has happened?’
JER.48.20	 They will answer, ‘Moab is disgraced, for it has fallen!
JER.48.20	Wail and cry out in mourning!
JER.48.20	Announce along the Arnon River
JER.48.20	that Moab has been destroyed.’
JER.48.21	 “Judgment will come on the cities on the high plain:
JER.48.22	 on Dibon, Nebo, and Beth Diblathaim, 
JER.48.23	 on Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul, and Beth Meon, 
JER.48.24	 on Kerioth and Bozrah. It will come on all the towns of Moab, both far and near. 
JER.48.25	 Moab’s might will be crushed. Its power will be broken.
JER.48.26	 “Moab has vaunted itself against me.
JER.48.26	So make him drunk with the wine of my wrath
JER.48.26	until he splashes
JER.48.26	until others treat him as a laughingstock.
JER.48.27	 For did not you people of Moab laugh at the people of Israel?
JER.48.27	Did you think that they were nothing but thieves,
JER.48.27	that you shook your head in contempt
JER.48.27	every time you talked about them?
JER.48.28	 Leave your towns, you inhabitants of Moab.
JER.48.28	Go and live in the cliffs.
JER.48.28	Be like a dove that makes its nest
JER.48.28	high on the sides of a ravine.
JER.48.29	 I have heard how proud the people of Moab are,
JER.48.29	I know how haughty they are.
JER.48.29	I have heard how arrogant, proud, and haughty they are,
JER.48.29	what a high opinion they have of themselves.
JER.48.30	 I, the 
JER.48.30	But their pride is ill-founded.
JER.48.30	Their boastings will prove to be false.
JER.48.31	 So I will weep with sorrow for Moab.
JER.48.31	I will cry out in sadness for all of Moab.
JER.48.31	I will moan
JER.48.32	 I will weep for the grapevines of Sibmah
JER.48.32	just like the town of Jazer weeps over them.
JER.48.32	Their branches once spread as far as the Dead Sea.
JER.48.32	They reached as far as the town of Jazer.
JER.48.32	The destroyer will ravage 
JER.48.32	her fig, date,
JER.48.33	 Joy and gladness will disappear
JER.48.33	from the fruitful land of Moab.
JER.48.33	I will stop the flow of wine from the winepresses.
JER.48.33	No one will stomp on the grapes there and shout for joy.
JER.48.33	The shouts there will be shouts of soldiers,
JER.48.33	not the shouts of those making wine.
JER.48.34	 Cries of anguish raised from Heshbon and Elealeh
JER.48.34	will be sounded as far as Jahaz.
JER.48.34	They will be sounded from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah.
JER.48.34	For even the waters of Nimrim will be dried up.
JER.48.35	 I will put an end in Moab
JER.48.35	to those who make offerings at her places of worship.
JER.48.35	I will put an end to those who sacrifice to other gods.
JER.48.35	I, the 
JER.48.36	 So my heart moans for Moab
JER.48.36	like a flute playing a funeral song.
JER.48.36	Yes, like a flute playing a funeral song,
JER.48.36	my heart moans for the people of Kir Heres.
JER.48.36	For the wealth they have gained will perish.
JER.48.37	 For all of them will shave their heads in mourning.
JER.48.37	They will all cut off their beards to show their sorrow.
JER.48.37	They will all make gashes in their hands.
JER.48.37	They will all put on sackcloth.
JER.48.38	 On all the housetops in Moab
JER.48.38	and in all its public squares
JER.48.38	there will be nothing but mourning.
JER.48.38	For I will break Moab like an unwanted jar.
JER.48.38	I, the 
JER.48.39	 Oh, how shattered Moab will be! 
JER.48.39	Oh, how her people will wail!
JER.48.39	Oh, how she will turn away
JER.48.39	Moab will become an object of ridicule,
JER.48.39	a terrifying sight to all the nations that surround her.”
JER.48.40	 For the 
JER.48.40	“Look! Like an eagle with outspread wings
JER.48.40	a nation will swoop down on Moab.
JER.48.41	 Her towns
JER.48.41	Her fortresses will be taken.
JER.48.41	At that time the soldiers of Moab will be frightened 
JER.48.41	like a woman in labor.
JER.48.42	 Moab will be destroyed and no longer be a nation,
JER.48.42	because she has vaunted herself against the 
JER.48.43	 Terror, pits, and traps
JER.48.43	for the people who live in Moab.
JER.48.43	I, the 
JER.48.44	 Anyone who flees at the sound of terror
JER.48.44	will fall into a pit.
JER.48.44	Anyone who climbs out of the pit
JER.48.44	will be caught in a trap.
JER.48.44	For the time is coming
JER.48.44	when I will punish the people of Moab.
JER.48.44	I, the 
JER.48.45	 In the shadows of the walls of Heshbon
JER.48.45	those trying to escape will stand helpless.
JER.48.45	For a fire will burst forth from Heshbon.
JER.48.45	Flames will shoot out from the former territory of Sihon.
JER.48.45	They will burn the foreheads of the people of Moab,
JER.48.45	the skulls of those war-loving people.
JER.48.46	 Moab, you are doomed!
JER.48.46	You people who worship Chemosh will be destroyed.
JER.48.46	Your sons will be taken away captive.
JER.48.46	Your daughters will be carried away into exile.
JER.48.47	 Yet in days to come 
JER.48.47	I will reverse Moab’s ill fortune.”
JER.48.47	says the 
JER.48.47	The judgment against Moab ends here.
JER.49.1	 The 
JER.49.1	“Do you think there are not any people of the nation of Israel remaining?
JER.49.1	Do you think there are not any of them remaining to reinherit their land?
JER.49.1	Is that why you people who worship the god Milcom
JER.49.1	have taken possession of the territory of Gad and live in his cities?
JER.49.2	 Because you did that, 
JER.49.2	I, the 
JER.49.2	when I will make Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon,
JER.49.2	hear the sound of the battle cry.
JER.49.2	It will become a mound covered with ruins.
JER.49.2	Its villages will be burned to the ground.
JER.49.2	Then Israel will take back its land 
JER.49.2	from those who took their land from them.
JER.49.2	I, the Lord, affirm it!
JER.49.3	 Wail, you people in Heshbon, because Ai in Ammon is destroyed.
JER.49.3	Cry out in anguish, you people in the villages surrounding
JER.49.3	Put on sackcloth and cry out in mourning.
JER.49.3	Run about covered with gashes.
JER.49.3	For your god Milcom will go into exile
JER.49.3	along with his priests and officials.
JER.49.4	 Why do you brag about your great power?
JER.49.4	Your power is ebbing away,
JER.49.4	who trust in your riches and say,
JER.49.4	‘Who would dare to attack us?’
JER.49.5	 I will bring terror on you from every side,”
JER.49.5	says the Lord 
JER.49.5	“You will be scattered in every direction.
JER.49.5	No one will gather the fugitives back together.
JER.49.6	 Yet in days to come 
JER.49.6	I will reverse Ammon’s ill fortune.”
JER.49.6	says the 
JER.49.7	 The 
JER.49.7	“Is wisdom no longer to be found in Teman?
JER.49.7	Can Edom’s counselors not give her any good advice?
JER.49.7	Has all of their wisdom turned bad?
JER.49.8	 Turn and flee! Take up refuge in remote places,
JER.49.8	you people who live in Dedan.
JER.49.8	For I will bring disaster on the descendants of Esau.
JER.49.8	I have decided it is time for me to punish them.
JER.49.9	 If grape pickers came to pick your grapes,
JER.49.9	would they not leave a few grapes behind?
JER.49.9	If robbers came at night,
JER.49.9	would they not pillage only what they needed?
JER.49.10	 But I will strip everything away from Esau’s descendants.
JER.49.10	I will uncover their hiding places so they cannot hide.
JER.49.10	Their children, relatives, and neighbors will all be destroyed.
JER.49.10	Not one of them will be left!
JER.49.11	 Leave your orphans behind and I will keep them alive.
JER.49.11	Your widows too can depend on me.”
JER.49.12	 For the 
JER.49.13	 For I solemnly swear,”
JER.49.14	 I said,
JER.49.14	A messenger has been sent among the nations to say,
JER.49.14	‘Gather your armies and march out against her!
JER.49.14	Prepare to do battle with her!’”
JER.49.15	 The 
JER.49.15	“I will certainly make you small among nations.
JER.49.15	I will make you despised by all humankind.
JER.49.16	 The terror you inspire in others
JER.49.16	and the arrogance of your heart have deceived you.
JER.49.16	You may make your home in the clefts of the rocks;
JER.49.16	you may occupy the highest places in the hills.
JER.49.16	But even if you made your home where the eagles nest,
JER.49.16	I would bring you down from there,”
JER.49.16	says the 
JER.49.17	 “Edom will become an object of horror.
JER.49.17	All who pass by it will be filled with horror; 
JER.49.17	they will hiss out their scorn 
JER.49.17	because of all the disasters that have happened to it.
JER.49.18	 Edom will be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah
JER.49.18	and the towns that were around them.
JER.49.18	No one will live there.
JER.49.18	No human being will settle in it,”
JER.49.18	says the 
JER.49.19	 “A lion coming up from the thick undergrowth along the Jordan
JER.49.19	scatters the sheep in the pastureland around it.
JER.49.19	So too I will chase the Edomites off their land.

JER.49.19	There is no

JER.49.20	what I intend to do to
JER.49.20	Their little ones will be dragged off.
JER.49.20	I will completely destroy their land because of what they have done.
JER.49.21	 The people of the earth will quake when they hear of their downfall.
JER.49.21	Their cries of anguish will be heard all the way to the Gulf of Aqaba.
JER.49.22	 Look! Like an eagle with outspread wings,
JER.49.22	a nation will soar up and swoop down on Bozrah.
JER.49.22	At that time the soldiers of Edom will be as fearful 
JER.49.22	as a woman in labor.”
JER.49.23	 The 
JER.49.23	“The people of Hamath and Arpad
JER.49.23	because they have heard bad news.
JER.49.23	Their courage will melt away because of worry.

JER.49.24	 The people of Damascus will lose heart and turn to flee.
JER.49.24	Panic will grip them.
JER.49.24	Pain and anguish will seize them
JER.49.24	like a woman in labor.
JER.49.25	 How deserted will that once-famous city
JER.49.25	that city that was once filled with

JER.49.27	 “I will set fire to the walls of Damascus;
JER.49.27	it will burn up the palaces of Ben Hadad.”
JER.49.28	 The 
JER.49.28	“Army of Babylon,

JER.49.31	They live all alone.
JER.49.32	 Their camels will be taken as plunder.
JER.49.32	Their vast herds will be taken as spoil.
JER.49.32	I will scatter to the four winds
JER.49.32	those desert peoples who cut their hair short at the temples.
JER.49.32	I will bring disaster against them
JER.49.32	from every direction,” says the 
JER.49.33	 “Hazor will become a permanent wasteland,
JER.49.33	a place where only jackals live.

JER.49.36	like the winds blowing in from the four quarters of heaven.
JER.49.36	I will scatter the people of Elam to the four winds.
JER.49.36	There will not be any nation where the refugees of Elam will not go.
JER.49.37	 I will make the people of Elam terrified of their enemies,
JER.49.37	who are seeking to kill them.
JER.49.37	I will vent my fierce anger
JER.49.37	and bring disaster upon them,”
JER.49.37	“I will send armies chasing after them
JER.49.37	until I have completely destroyed them.
JER.49.38	 I will establish my sovereignty over Elam.
JER.49.38	I will destroy their king and their leaders,”
JER.49.39	 “Yet in days to come 
JER.49.39	I will reverse Elam’s ill fortune.”
JER.49.39	says the 
JER.50.1	 The 
JER.50.2	 “Announce

JER.51.17	There is no breath in any of those idols.
JER.51.18	 They are worthless, objects to be ridiculed.
JER.51.18	When the time comes to punish them, they will be destroyed.
JER.51.19	 The

JER.51.30	They will lose their strength to do battle.
JER.51.30	They will be as frightened as women.
JER.51.30	The houses in her cities will be set on fire.
JER.51.30	The gates of her cities will be broken down.
JER.51.31	 One runner after another will come to the king of Babylon.
JER.51.31	One messenger after another will come bringing news.
JER.51.31	They will bring news to the king of Babylon
JER.51.31	that his whole city has been captured.
JER.51.32	 They will report that the fords have been captured,
JER.51.32	the reed marshes have been burned,

JER.51.33	 For the 
JER.51.33	‘Fair Babylon

JER.51.35	 The person who lives in Zion says,
JER.51.35	“May Babylon pay for the violence done to me and to my relatives.”
JER.51.35	Jerusalem says,
JER.51.35	“May those living in Babylonia pay for the bloodshed of my people.”

JER.51.36	“I will stand up for your cause.
JER.51.36	I will pay the Babylonians back for what they have done to you.
JER.51.36	I will dry up their sea.
JER.51.36	I will make their springs run dry.
JER.51.37	 Babylon will become a heap of ruins.
JER.51.37	Jackals will make their home there.
JER.51.37	It will become an object of horror and of hissing scorn,
JER.51.37	a place where no one lives.
JER.51.38	 The Babylonians are all like lions roaring for prey.
JER.51.38	They are like lion cubs growling for something to eat.
JER.51.39	 When their appetites are all stirred up,
JER.51.39	I will set out a banquet for them.
JER.51.39	I will make them drunk
JER.51.39	so that they will pass out,
JER.51.39	they will fall asleep forever,
JER.51.39	they will never wake up,”
JER.51.39	says the 
JER.51.40	 “I will lead them off to be slaughtered
JER.51.40	like lambs, rams, and male goats.”
JER.51.41	 “See how Babylon
JER.51.41	See how the pride of the whole earth has been taken!
JER.51.41	See what an object of horror
JER.51.41	Babylon has become among the nations!
JER.51.42	 The sea has swept over Babylon.
JER.51.42	She has been covered by a multitude
JER.51.43	 The towns of Babylonia have become heaps of ruins.
JER.51.43	She has become a dry and barren desert.
JER.51.43	No one lives in those towns any more.
JER.51.43	No one even passes through them.
JER.51.44	 I will punish the god Bel in Babylon.
JER.51.44	I will make him spit out what he has swallowed.
JER.51.44	The nations will not come streaming to him any longer.
JER.51.44	Indeed, the walls of Babylon will fall.”
JER.51.45	 “Get out of Babylon, my people!
JER.51.45	Flee to save your lives
JER.51.45	from the fierce anger of the 
JER.51.46	 Do not lose your courage or become afraid
JER.51.46	because of the reports that are heard in the land.
JER.51.46	For a report will come in one year.
JER.51.46	Another report will follow it in the next.
JER.51.46	There will be violence in the land

JER.51.47	 “So the time will certainly come
JER.51.47	when I will punish the idols of Babylon.
JER.51.47	Her whole land will be put to shame.
JER.51.47	All her mortally wounded will collapse in her midst.
JER.51.48	 Then heaven and earth and all that is in them
JER.51.48	will sing for joy over Babylon.
JER.51.48	For destroyers from the north will attack it,”
JER.51.48	says the 
JER.51.49	 “Babylon must fall
JER.51.49	because of the Israelites she has killed,
JER.51.49	just as the earth’s mortally wounded fell
JER.51.49	because of Babylon.
JER.51.50	 You who have escaped the sword,

JER.51.50	Remember the 
JER.51.50	Think about Jerusalem.
JER.51.51	 ‘We
JER.51.51	Our faces show our disgrace.
JER.51.51	For foreigners have invaded 
JER.51.51	the holy rooms
JER.51.52	 Yes, but the time will certainly come,”
JER.51.52	“when I will punish her idols.
JER.51.52	Throughout her land the mortally wounded will groan.
JER.51.53	 Even if Babylon climbs high into the sky
JER.51.53	and fortifies her elevated stronghold,
JER.51.53	I will send destroyers against her,”
JER.51.53	says the 
JER.51.54	 Cries of anguish will come from Babylon,
JER.51.54	the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians.
JER.51.55	 For the 
JER.51.55	and put an end to her loud noise.
JER.51.55	Their waves
JER.51.55	They will make a deafening noise.
JER.51.56	 For a destroyer is attacking Babylon.
JER.51.56	Her warriors will be captured;
JER.51.56	their bows will be broken.
JER.51.56	For the 
JER.51.56	he pays back in full.
JER.51.57	 “I will make her officials and wise men drunk, 
JER.51.57	along with her governors, leaders,
JER.51.57	They will fall asleep forever and never wake up,”
JER.51.57	says the King whose name is the 
JER.51.58	 This is what the 
JER.51.58	“Babylon’s thick wall
JER.51.58	Her high gates will be set on fire.
JER.51.58	The peoples strive for what does not satisfy.
JER.51.58	The nations grow weary trying to get what will be destroyed.”
JER.51.59	 This is the order Jeremiah the prophet gave to Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went to King Zedekiah of Judah in Babylon during the fourth year of his reign.
JER.51.60	 Jeremiah recorded
JER.51.61	 Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you arrive in Babylon, make sure
JER.51.62	 Then say, ‘O 
JER.51.63	 When you finish reading this scroll aloud, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River.
JER.51.64	 Then say, ‘In the same way Babylon will sink and never rise again because of the judgments
JER.51.64	The prophecies of Jeremiah end here.
JER.52.1	 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem
JER.52.2	 He did what displeased the 
JER.52.3	 What follows is a record of what happened to Jerusalem and Judah because of the 
JER.52.4	 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against Jerusalem with his whole army and set up camp outside it.
JER.52.5	 The city remained under siege until Zedekiah’s eleventh year. 
JER.52.6	 By the ninth day of the fourth month
JER.52.7	 They broke through the city walls, and all the soldiers tried to escape. They left the city during the night. They went through the gate between the two walls that is near the king’s garden.
JER.52.8	 But the Babylonian army chased after the king. They caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho,
JER.52.9	 They captured him and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah
JER.52.10	 The king of Babylon had Zedekiah’s sons put to death while Zedekiah was forced to watch. He also had all the nobles of Judah put to death there at Riblah. 
JER.52.11	 He had Zedekiah’s eyes put out and had him bound in chains.
JER.52.12	 On the tenth
JER.52.13	 He burned down the 
JER.52.14	 The whole Babylonian army that came with the captain of the royal guard tore down the walls that surrounded Jerusalem. 
JER.52.15	 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, took into exile some of the poor,
JER.52.16	 But he
JER.52.17	 The Babylonians broke the two bronze pillars in the temple of the 
JER.52.18	 They also took the pots, shovels,
JER.52.19	 The captain of the royal guard took the gold and silver bowls, censers,
JER.52.20	 The bronze of the items that King Solomon made for the 
JER.52.21	 Each of the pillars was about 27 feet
JER.52.22	 The bronze top of one pillar was about seven and one-half feet
JER.52.23	 There were ninety-six pomegranate-shaped ornaments on the sides; in all there were one hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments over the latticework that went around it.
JER.52.24	 The captain of the royal guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest who was second in rank, and the three doorkeepers.
JER.52.25	 From the city he took an official who was in charge of the soldiers, seven of the king’s advisers who were discovered in the city, an official army secretary who drafted citizens
JER.52.26	 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
JER.52.27	 The king of Babylon ordered them to be executed
JER.52.27	So Judah was taken into exile away from its land. 
JER.52.28	 Here is the official record of the number of people
JER.52.29	 in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year,
JER.52.30	 in Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year,
JER.52.31	 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, on the twenty-fifth
JER.52.32	 He spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prestigious position than
JER.52.33	 Jehoiachin

EZK.3.13	 and the sound of the living beings’ wings brushing against each other, and the sound of the wheels alongside them, a great rumbling sound. 
EZK.3.14	 A wind lifted me up and carried me away. I went bitterly,

EZK.4.7	 You must turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared and prophesy against it. 
EZK.4.8	 Look here, I will tie you up with ropes, so you cannot turn from one side to the other until you complete the days of your siege.
EZK.4.9	 “As for you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt,

EZK.8.2	 As I watched, I noticed

EZK.8.8	 He said to me, “Son of man, dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and discovered a doorway. 
EZK.8.9	 He said to me, “Go in and see the evil abominations they are practicing here.” 
EZK.8.10	 So I went in and looked. I noticed every figure
EZK.8.11	 Seventy men from the elders of the house of Israel

EZK.9.6	 Old men, young men, young women, little children, and women – wipe them out! But do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary!” So they began with the elders who were at the front of the temple. 
EZK.9.7	 He said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courtyards with corpses. Go!” So they went out and struck people down throughout the city. 
EZK.9.8	 While they were striking them down, I was left alone, and I threw myself face down and cried out, “Ah, sovereign

EZK.12.5	 While they are watching, dig a hole in the wall and carry your belongings out through it. 
EZK.12.6	 While they are watching, raise your baggage onto your shoulder and carry it out in the dark.
EZK.12.7	 So I did just as I was commanded. I carried out my belongings packed for exile during the day, and at evening I dug myself a hole through the wall with my hands. I went out in the darkness, carrying my baggage
EZK.12.8	 The word of the 
EZK.12.9	 “Son of man, has not the house of Israel, that rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’ 
EZK.12.10	 Say to them, ‘This is what the sovereign

EZK.40.16	 There were closed windows toward the alcoves and toward their jambs within the gate all around, and likewise for the porches. There were windows all around the inside, and on each jamb were decorative palm trees.
EZK.40.17	 Then he brought me to the outer court. I saw
EZK.40.18	 The pavement was beside the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement. 
EZK.40.19	 Then he measured the width from before the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the inner court as 175 feet
EZK.40.20	 He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court which faces north. 
EZK.40.21	 Its alcoves, three on each side, and its jambs and porches had the same measurement as the first gate; 87Â½ feet
EZK.40.22	 Its windows, its porches, and its decorative palm trees had the same measurement as the gate which faced east. Seven steps led up to it, and its porch was in front of them. 
EZK.40.23	 Opposite the gate on the north and the east was a gate of the inner court; he measured the distance from gate to gate at 175 feet.
EZK.40.24	 Then he led me toward the south. I saw
EZK.40.25	 There were windows all around it and its porches, like the windows of the others;
EZK.40.26	 There were seven steps going up to it; its porches were in front of them. It had decorative palm trees on its jambs, one on either side. 
EZK.40.27	 The inner court had a gate toward the south; he measured it from gate to gate toward the south as 175 feet.
EZK.40.28	 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. He measured the south gate; it had the same dimensions as the others. 
EZK.40.29	 Its alcoves, its jambs, and its porches had the same dimensions as the others, and there were windows all around it and its porches; its length was 87Â½ feet
EZK.40.30	 There were porches all around, 43Â¾ feet
EZK.40.31	 Its porches faced the outer court, and decorative palm trees were on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps. 
EZK.40.32	 Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side. He measured the gate; it had the same dimensions as the others. 
EZK.40.33	 Its alcoves, its jambs, and its porches had the same dimensions as the others, and there were windows all around it and its porches; its length was 87Â½ feet
EZK.40.34	 Its porches faced the outer court, it had decorative palm trees on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps. 
EZK.40.35	 Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it; it had the same dimensions as the others – 
EZK.40.36	 its alcoves, its jambs, and its porches. It had windows all around it; its length was 87Â½ feet
EZK.40.37	 Its jambs
EZK.40.38	 There was a chamber with its door by the porch of the gate;
EZK.40.39	 In the porch of the gate were two tables on either side on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering. 
EZK.40.40	 On the outside of the porch as one goes up at the entrance of the north gate were two tables, and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables. 
EZK.40.41	 Four tables were on each side of the gate, eight tables on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered. 
EZK.40.42	 The four tables for the burnt offering were of carved stone, 32 inches
EZK.40.43	 There were hooks
EZK.40.44	 On the outside of the inner gate were chambers for the singers of the inner court, one
EZK.40.45	 He said to me, “This chamber which faces south is for the priests who keep charge of the temple,
EZK.40.46	 and the chamber which faces north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the descendants of Zadok, from the descendants of Levi, who may approach the 
EZK.40.47	 He measured the court as a square 175 feet long and 175 feet wide;
EZK.40.48	 Then he brought me to the porch of the temple and measured the jambs of the porch as 8Â¾ feet
EZK.40.49	 The length of the porch was 35 feet
EZK.41.1	 Then he brought me to the outer sanctuary, and measured the jambs; the jambs were 10Â½ feet
EZK.41.2	 The width of the entrance was 17Â½ feet,
EZK.41.3	 Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance as 3Â½ feet,
EZK.41.4	 Then he measured its length as 35 feet,
EZK.41.5	 Then he measured the wall of the temple
EZK.41.6	 The side chambers were in three stories, one above the other, thirty in each story. There were offsets in the wall all around to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that the supports were not in the wall of the temple. 
EZK.41.7	 The side chambers surrounding the temple were wider at each successive story;
EZK.41.8	 I saw that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full measuring stick
EZK.41.9	 The width of the outer wall of the side chambers was 8Â¾ feet,
EZK.41.10	 and the chambers of the court was 35 feet
EZK.41.11	 There were entrances from the side chambers toward the open area, one entrance toward the north, and another entrance toward the south; the width of the open area was 8Â¾ feet
EZK.41.12	 The building that was facing the temple courtyard at the west side was 122Â½ feet
EZK.41.13	 Then he measured the temple as 175 feet
EZK.41.14	 and also the width of the front of the temple and the courtyard on the east as 175 feet.
EZK.41.15	 Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, with its galleries on either side as 175 feet.
EZK.41.15	The interior of the outer sanctuary and the porch of the court,
EZK.41.16	 as well as the thresholds, narrow windows and galleries all around on three sides facing the threshold were paneled with wood all around, from the ground up to the windows (now the windows were covered), 
EZK.41.17	 to the space above the entrance, to the inner room, and on the outside, and on all the walls in the inner room and outside, by measurement.
EZK.41.18	 It was made with cherubim and decorative palm trees, with a palm tree between each cherub. Each cherub had two faces: 
EZK.41.19	 a human face toward the palm tree on one side and a lion’s face toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple all around; 
EZK.41.20	 from the ground to the area above the entrance, cherubim and decorative palm trees were carved on the wall of the outer sanctuary. 
EZK.41.21	 The doorposts of the outer sanctuary were square. In front of the sanctuary one doorpost looked just like the other. 
EZK.41.22	 The altar was of wood, 5Â¼ feet
EZK.41.23	 The outer sanctuary and the inner sanctuary each had a double door. 
EZK.41.24	 Each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging
EZK.41.25	 On the doors of the outer sanctuary were carved cherubim and palm trees, like those carved on the walls, and there was a canopy
EZK.41.26	 There were narrow windows and decorative palm trees on either side of the side walls of the porch; this is what the side chambers of the temple and the canopies were like. 
EZK.42.1	 Then he led me out to the outer court, toward the north, and brought me to the chamber which was opposite the courtyard and opposite the building on the north. 
EZK.42.2	 Its length was 175 feet
EZK.42.3	 Opposite the 35 feet
EZK.42.4	 In front of the chambers was a walkway on the inner side, 17Â½ feet
EZK.42.5	 Now the upper chambers were narrower, because the galleries took more space from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building. 
EZK.42.6	 For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper chambers
EZK.42.7	 As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court facing the chambers, it was 87Â½ feet
EZK.42.8	 For the chambers on the outer court were 87Â½ feet
EZK.42.9	 Below these chambers was a passage on the east side as one enters from the outer court. 
EZK.42.10	 At the beginning
EZK.42.11	 with a passage in front of them. They looked like the chambers on the north. Of the same length and width, and all their exits according to their arrangements and entrances 
EZK.42.12	 were the chambers
EZK.42.13	 Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers which face the courtyard are holy chambers where the priests
EZK.42.14	 When the priests enter, then they will not go out from the sanctuary to the outer court without taking off their garments in which they minister, for these are holy; they will put on other garments, then they will go near the places where the people are.”
EZK.42.15	 Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple, he led me out by the gate which faces east and measured all around. 
EZK.42.16	 He measured the east side with the measuring stick
EZK.42.17	 He measured the north side as 875 feet by the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.18	 He measured the south side as 875 feet by the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.19	 He turned to the west side and measured 875 feet by the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.20	 He measured it on all four sides. It had a wall around it, 875 feet long and 875 feet wide, to separate the holy and common places. 
EZK.43.1	 Then he brought me to the gate that faced toward the east. 
EZK.43.2	 I saw
EZK.43.3	 It was like the vision I saw when he
EZK.43.4	 The glory of the 
EZK.43.5	 Then a wind
EZK.43.6	 I heard someone speaking to me from the temple, while the man was standing beside me. 
EZK.43.7	 He said to me: “Son of man, this is the place of my throne
EZK.43.8	 When they placed their threshold by my threshold and their doorpost by my doorpost, with only the wall between me and them, they profaned my holy name by the abominable deeds they committed. So I consumed them in my anger. 
EZK.43.9	 Now they must put away their spiritual prostitution and the pillars of their kings far from me, and then I will live among them forever. 
EZK.43.10	 “As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, so that they will be ashamed of their sins and measure the pattern. 
EZK.43.11	 When they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple, its pattern, its exits and entrances, and its whole design – all its statutes, its entire design, and all its laws; write it all down in their sight, so that they may observe its entire design and all its statutes and do them. 
EZK.43.12	 “This is the law of the temple: The entire area on top of the mountain all around will be most holy. Indeed, this is the law of the temple. 
EZK.43.13	 “And these are the measurements of the altar:
EZK.43.14	 From the base of the ground to the lower edge is 3Â½ feet,
EZK.43.15	 and the altar hearth, 7 feet, and from the altar hearth four horns projecting upward. 
EZK.43.16	 Now the altar hearth
EZK.43.17	 The ledge is 24Â½ feet
EZK.43.18	 Then he said to me: “Son of man, this is what the sovereign 
EZK.43.19	 you will give a young bull for a sin offering to the Levitical priests who are descended from Zadok, who approach me to minister to me, declares the sovereign 
EZK.43.20	 You will take some of its blood, and place it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around; you will cleanse it and make atonement for it.
EZK.43.21	 You will also take the bull for the sin offering, and it will be burned in the appointed place in the temple, outside the sanctuary. 
EZK.43.22	 “On the second day, you will offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering. They will purify the altar just as they purified it with the bull. 
EZK.43.23	 When you have finished purifying it, you will offer an unblemished young bull and an unblemished ram from the flock. 
EZK.43.24	 You will present them before the 
EZK.43.25	 “For seven days you will provide every day a goat for a sin offering; a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without blemish, will be provided. 
EZK.43.26	 For seven days they will make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, so they will consecrate it.
EZK.43.27	 When the prescribed period is over,
EZK.44.1	 Then he brought me back by way of the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces east, but it was shut. 
EZK.44.2	 The 
EZK.44.3	 Only the prince may sit in it to eat a sacrificial meal
EZK.44.4	 Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. As I watched, I noticed
EZK.44.5	 The 
EZK.44.6	 Say to the rebellious,
EZK.44.7	 When you bring foreigners, those uncircumcised in heart and in flesh, into my sanctuary, you desecrate
EZK.44.8	 You have not kept charge of my holy things, but you have assigned foreigners
EZK.44.9	 This is what the sovereign 
EZK.44.10	 “‘But the Levites who went far from me, straying off from me after their idols when Israel went astray, will be responsible for
EZK.44.11	 Yet they will be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the temple, and serving the temple. They will slaughter the burnt offerings and the sacrifices for the people, and they will stand before them to minister to them. 
EZK.44.12	 Because they used to minister to them before their idols, and became a sinful obstacle
EZK.44.13	 They will not come near me to serve me as priest, nor will they come near any of my holy things, the things which are most sacred. They will bear the shame of the abominable deeds they have committed. 
EZK.44.14	 Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the temple, all of its service and all that will be done in it. 
EZK.44.15	 “‘But the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok
EZK.44.16	 They will enter my sanctuary, and approach my table to minister to me; they will keep my charge. 
EZK.44.17	 “‘When they enter the gates of the inner court, they must wear linen garments; they must not have any wool on them when they minister in the inner gates of the court and in the temple. 
EZK.44.18	 Linen turbans will be on their heads and linen undergarments will be around their waists; they must not bind themselves with anything that causes sweat. 
EZK.44.19	 When they go out to the outer court to the people, they must remove the garments they were ministering in, and place them in the holy chambers; they must put on other garments so that they will not transmit holiness to the people with their garments.
EZK.44.20	 “‘They must not shave their heads
EZK.44.21	 No priest may drink wine when he enters the inner court. 
EZK.44.22	 They must not marry a widow or a divorcee, but they may marry a virgin from the house of Israel
EZK.44.23	 Moreover, they will teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to distinguish between the ceremonially unclean and the clean.
EZK.44.24	 “‘In a controversy they will act as judges;
EZK.44.25	 “‘They must not come near a dead person or they will be defiled;
EZK.44.26	 After a priest
EZK.44.27	 On the day he enters the sanctuary, into the inner court to serve in the sanctuary, he must offer his sin offering, declares the sovereign 
EZK.44.28	 “‘This will be their inheritance: I am their inheritance, and you must give them no property in Israel; I am their property.
EZK.44.29	 They may eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, and every devoted thing in Israel will be theirs. 
EZK.44.30	 The first of all the first fruits and all contributions of any kind
EZK.44.31	 The priests will not eat any bird or animal that has died a natural death or was torn to pieces by a wild animal.
EZK.45.1	 “‘When you allot the land as an inheritance, you will offer an allotment
EZK.45.2	 Of this area a square 875 feet
EZK.45.3	 From this measured area you will measure a length of eight and a quarter miles
EZK.45.4	 It will be a holy portion of the land; it will be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary who approach the 
EZK.45.5	 An area eight and a quarter miles
EZK.45.6	 “‘Alongside the portion set apart as the holy allotment, you will allot for the city an area one and two-thirds miles
EZK.45.7	 “‘For the prince there will be land on both sides of the holy allotment and the allotted city, alongside the holy allotment and the allotted city, on the west side and on the east side; it will be comparable in length to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border 
EZK.45.8	 of the land. This will be his property in Israel. My princes will no longer oppress my people, but the land will be allotted to the house of Israel according to their tribes. 
EZK.45.9	 “‘This is what the sovereign 
EZK.45.10	 You must use just balances,
EZK.45.11	 The dry and liquid measures will be the same, the bath will contain a tenth of a homer,
EZK.45.12	 The shekel will be twenty gerahs. Sixty shekels
EZK.45.13	 “‘This is the offering you must offer: a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat; a sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley, 
EZK.45.14	 and as the prescribed portion of olive oil, one tenth of a bath from each kor (which is ten baths or a homer, for ten baths make a homer); 
EZK.45.15	 and one sheep from each flock of two hundred, from the watered places of Israel, for a grain offering, burnt offering, and peace offering, to make atonement for them, declares the sovereign 
EZK.45.16	 All the people of the land will contribute
EZK.45.17	 It will be the duty of the prince to provide the burnt offerings, the grain offering, and the drink offering at festivals, on the new moons and Sabbaths, at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel; he will provide the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel. 
EZK.45.18	 “‘This is what the sovereign 
EZK.45.19	 The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering and place it on the doorpost of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the doorpost of the gate of the inner court. 
EZK.45.20	 This is what you must do on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins inadvertently or through ignorance; so you will make atonement for the temple. 
EZK.45.21	 “‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you will celebrate the Passover, and for seven days bread made without yeast will be eaten. 
EZK.45.22	 On that day the prince will provide for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering. 
EZK.45.23	 And during the seven days of the feast he will provide as a burnt offering to the 
EZK.45.24	 He will provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull, an ephah for each ram, and a gallon

EZK.46.1	 “‘This is what the sovereign 
EZK.46.2	 The prince will enter by way of the porch of the gate from the outside, and will stand by the doorpost of the gate. The priests will provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he will bow down at the threshold of the gate and then go out. But the gate will not be closed until evening. 
EZK.46.3	 The people of the land will bow down at the entrance of that gate before the 
EZK.46.4	 The burnt offering which the prince will offer to the 
EZK.46.5	 The grain offering will be an ephah with the ram, and the grain offering with the lambs will be as much as he is able to give,
EZK.46.6	 On the day of the new moon he will offer
EZK.46.7	 He will provide a grain offering: an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wishes,
EZK.46.8	 When the prince enters, he will come by way of the porch of the gate and will go out the same way. 
EZK.46.9	 “‘When the people of the land come before the 
EZK.46.10	 When they come in, the prince will come in with them, and when they go out, he will go out. 
EZK.46.11	 “‘At the festivals and at the appointed feasts the grain offering will be an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as one is able,

EZK.46.17	 But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will be his until the year of liberty;
EZK.46.18	 The prince will not take away any of the people’s inheritance by oppressively removing them from their property. He will give his sons an inheritance from his own possessions so that my people will not be scattered, each from his own property.’” 
EZK.46.19	 Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests which faced north. There I saw
EZK.46.20	 He said to me, “This is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they will bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out to the outer court to transmit holiness to the people.” 
EZK.46.21	 Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me past the four corners of the court, and I noticed
EZK.46.22	 In the four corners of the court were small
EZK.46.23	 There was a row of masonry around each of the four courts, and places for boiling offerings were made under the rows all around. 
EZK.46.24	 Then he said to me, “These are the houses for boiling, where the ministers of the temple boil the sacrifices of the people.” 
EZK.47.1	 Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple. I noticed
EZK.47.2	 He led me out by way of the north gate and brought me around the outside of the outer gate that faces toward the east; I noticed
EZK.47.3	 When the man went out toward the east with a measuring line in his hand, he measured 1,750 feet,
EZK.47.4	 Again he measured 1,750 feet and led me through the water, which was now knee deep. Once more he measured 1,750 feet and led me through the water, which was waist deep. 
EZK.47.5	 Again he measured 1,750 feet and it was a river I could not cross, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed. 
EZK.47.6	 He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” 
EZK.47.6	Then he led me back to the bank of the river. 
EZK.47.7	 When I had returned, I noticed
EZK.47.8	 He said to me, “These waters go out toward the eastern region and flow down into the Arabah; when they enter the Dead Sea,
EZK.47.9	 Every living creature which swarms where the river
EZK.47.10	 Fishermen will stand beside it; from Engedi to En-eglaim they will spread nets. They will catch many kinds of fish, like the fish of the Great Sea.
EZK.47.11	 But its swamps and its marshes will not become fresh; they will remain salty. 
EZK.47.12	 On both sides of the river’s banks, every kind of tree will grow for food. Their leaves will not wither nor will their fruit fail, but they will bear fruit every month, because their water source flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing.”
EZK.47.13	 This is what the sovereign 
EZK.47.14	 You must divide it equally just as I vowed to give it to your forefathers;
EZK.47.15	 “This will be the border of the land:
EZK.47.16	 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, as far as Hazer-hattikon, which is on the border of Hauran. 
EZK.47.17	 The border will run from the sea to Hazar-enan, at the border of Damascus, and on the north is the border of Hamath. This is the north side. 
EZK.47.18	 On the east side, between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, will be the Jordan. You will measure from the border to the eastern sea. This is the east side. 
EZK.47.19	 On the south side it will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh, the river,
EZK.47.20	 On the west side the Great Sea will be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This is the west side. 
EZK.47.21	 “This is how you will divide this land for yourselves among the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	 You must allot it as an inheritance among yourselves and for the foreigners who reside among you, who have fathered sons among you. You must treat them as native-born among the people of Israel; they will be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
EZK.47.23	 In whatever tribe the foreigner resides, there you will give him his inheritance,” declares the sovereign 
EZK.48.1	 “These are the names of the tribes: From the northern end beside the road of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enan (which is on the border of Damascus, toward the north beside Hamath), extending from the east side to the west, Dan will have one portion. 
EZK.48.2	 Next to the border of Dan, from the east side to the west, Asher
EZK.48.3	 Next to the border of Asher from the east side to the west, Naphtali will have one portion. 
EZK.48.4	 Next to the border of Naphtali from the east side to the west, Manasseh will have one portion. 
EZK.48.5	 Next to the border of Manasseh from the east side to the west, Ephraim will have one portion. 
EZK.48.6	 Next to the border of Ephraim from the east side to the west, Reuben will have one portion. 
EZK.48.7	 Next to the border of Reuben from the east side to the west, Judah
EZK.48.8	 “Next to the border of Judah from the east side to the west will be the allotment you must set apart. It is to be eight and a quarter miles
EZK.48.9	 The allotment you set apart to the 
EZK.48.10	 These will be the allotments for the holy portion: for the priests, toward the north eight and a quarter miles
EZK.48.11	 This will be for the priests who are set apart from the descendants of Zadok who kept my charge and did not go astray when the people of Israel strayed off, like the Levites did.
EZK.48.12	 It will be their portion from the allotment of the land, a most holy place, next to the border of the Levites. 
EZK.48.13	 “Alongside the border of the priests, the Levites will have an allotment eight and a quarter miles
EZK.48.14	 They must not sell or exchange any of it; they must not transfer this choice portion of land, for it is set apart
EZK.48.15	 “The remainder, one and two-thirds miles
EZK.48.16	 these will be its measurements: The north side will be one and one-half miles,
EZK.48.17	 The city will have open spaces: On the north there will be 437Â½ feet,
EZK.48.18	 The remainder of the length alongside the holy allotment will be three and one-third miles
EZK.48.19	 The workers of the city from all the tribes of Israel will cultivate it. 
EZK.48.20	 The whole allotment will be eight and a quarter miles
EZK.48.21	 “The rest, on both sides of the holy allotment and the property of the city, will belong to the prince. Extending from the eight and a quarter miles
EZK.48.22	 The property of the Levites and of the city will be in the middle of that which belongs to the prince. The portion between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin will be for the prince. 
EZK.48.23	 “As for the rest of the tribes: From the east side to the west side, Benjamin will have one portion.

EZK.48.25	 Next to the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar will have one portion. 
EZK.48.26	 Next to the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun will have one portion. 
EZK.48.27	 Next to the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad will have one portion. 
EZK.48.28	 Next to the border of Gad, at the south side, the border will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh, to the Stream of Egypt

DAN.1.1	 In the third
DAN.1.2	 Now the Lord
DAN.1.3	 The king commanded
DAN.1.4	 young men in whom there was no physical defect and who were handsome,
DAN.1.5	 So the king assigned them a daily ration
DAN.1.6	 As it turned out,
DAN.1.7	 But the overseer of the court officials renamed them. He gave
DAN.1.8	 But Daniel made up his mind
DAN.1.9	 Then God made the overseer of the court officials sympathetic to Daniel.
DAN.1.10	 But he
DAN.1.11	 Daniel then spoke to the warden
DAN.1.12	 “Please test your servants for ten days by providing us with some vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	 Then compare our appearance
DAN.1.14	 So the warden
DAN.1.15	 At the end of the ten days their appearance was better and their bodies were healthier
DAN.1.16	 So the warden removed the delicacies and the wine
DAN.1.17	 Now as for these four young men, God endowed them with knowledge and skill in all sorts of literature and wisdom – and Daniel had insight into all kinds of visions and dreams. 
DAN.1.18	 When the time appointed by the king arrived,
DAN.1.19	 When the king spoke with them, he did not find among the entire group
DAN.1.20	 In every matter of wisdom and
DAN.1.21	 Now Daniel lived on until the first
DAN.2.1	 In the second year of his
DAN.2.2	 The king issued an order
DAN.2.3	 The king told them, “I have had a dream,
DAN.2.4	 The wise men replied to the king: [What follows is in Aramaic
DAN.2.5	 The king replied
DAN.2.6	 But if you can disclose the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts, a reward, and considerable honor. So disclose to me the dream and its interpretation!” 
DAN.2.7	 They again replied, “Let the king inform us
DAN.2.8	 The king replied, “I know for sure that you are attempting to gain time, because you see that my decision is firm. 
DAN.2.9	 If you don’t inform me of the dream, there is only one thing that is going to happen to you.
DAN.2.10	 The wise men replied to the king, “There is no man on earth who is able to disclose the king’s secret,
DAN.2.11	 What the king is asking is too difficult, and no one exists who can disclose it to the king, except for the gods – but they don’t live among mortals!”
DAN.2.12	 Because of this the king got furiously angry
DAN.2.13	 So a decree went out, and the wise men were about
DAN.2.14	 Then Daniel spoke with prudent counsel
DAN.2.15	 He inquired of Arioch the king’s deputy, “Why is the decree from the king so urgent?”
DAN.2.16	 So Daniel went in and
DAN.2.17	 Then Daniel went to his home and informed his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the matter. 
DAN.2.18	 He asked them to pray for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery so that he
DAN.2.19	 Then in a night vision the mystery was revealed to Daniel. So Daniel praised
DAN.2.20	 saying,
DAN.2.20	“Let the name of God
DAN.2.20	for wisdom and power belong to him.
DAN.2.21	 He changes times and seasons,
DAN.2.21	deposing some kings 
DAN.2.21	and establishing others.
DAN.2.21	He gives wisdom to the wise;
DAN.2.21	he imparts knowledge to those with understanding;
DAN.2.22	 he reveals deep and hidden things.
DAN.2.22	He knows what is in the darkness,
DAN.2.22	and light resides with him.
DAN.2.23	 O God of my fathers, I acknowledge and glorify you,
DAN.2.23	for you have bestowed wisdom and power on me.
DAN.2.23	Now you have enabled me to understand what I
DAN.2.23	For you have enabled me to understand the king’s dilemma.”
DAN.2.24	 Then Daniel went in to see
DAN.2.25	 So Arioch quickly ushered Daniel into the king’s presence, saying to him, “I
DAN.2.26	 The king then asked Daniel (whose name was also Belteshazzar), “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I saw, as well as its interpretation?” 
DAN.2.27	 Daniel replied to the king, “The mystery that the king is asking about is such that no wise men, astrologers, magicians, or diviners can possibly disclose it to the king. 
DAN.2.28	 However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries,
DAN.2.29	 “As for you, O king, while you were in your bed your thoughts turned to future things.
DAN.2.30	 As for me, this mystery was revealed to me not because I possess more wisdom
DAN.2.31	 “You, O king, were watching as a great statue – one
DAN.2.32	 As for that statue, its head was of fine gold, its chest and arms were of silver, its belly and thighs were of bronze. 
DAN.2.33	 Its legs were of iron; its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay.
DAN.2.34	 You were watching as
DAN.2.35	 Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were broken in pieces without distinction
DAN.2.36	 This was the dream. Now we
DAN.2.37	 “You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has granted you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor. 
DAN.2.38	 Wherever human beings,
DAN.2.39	 Now after you another kingdom
DAN.2.40	 Then there will be a fourth kingdom, one strong like iron. Just like iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything, and as iron breaks in pieces
DAN.2.41	 In that you were seeing feet and toes
DAN.2.42	 In that the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, the latter stages of this kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile. 
DAN.2.43	 And
DAN.2.44	 In the days of those kings the God of heaven will raise up an everlasting kingdom that will not be destroyed and a kingdom that will not be left to another people. It will break in pieces and bring about the demise of all these kingdoms. But it will stand forever. 
DAN.2.45	 You saw that a stone was cut from a mountain, but not by human hands; it smashed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold into pieces. The great God has made known to the king what will occur in the future.
DAN.2.46	 Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed down with his face to the ground
DAN.2.47	 The king replied to Daniel, “Certainly your God is a God of gods and Lord of kings and revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery!” 
DAN.2.48	 Then the king elevated Daniel to high position and bestowed on him many marvelous gifts. He granted him authority over the entire province of Babylon and made him the main prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.49	 And at Daniel’s request, the king
DAN.3.1	 King Nebuchadnezzar had a golden
DAN.3.2	 Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent out a summons to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates,
DAN.3.3	 So the satraps, prefects, governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other provincial authorities assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected. They were standing in front of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had erected.
DAN.3.4	 Then the herald
DAN.3.5	 When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither,
DAN.3.6	 Whoever does not bow down and pay homage will immediately
DAN.3.7	 Therefore when they all
DAN.3.8	 Now
DAN.3.9	 They said
DAN.3.10	 You have issued an edict, O king, that everyone must bow down and pay homage to the golden statue when they hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music. 
DAN.3.11	 And whoever does not bow down and pay homage must be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.12	 But there are Jewish men whom you appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon – Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego – and these men
DAN.3.13	 Then Nebuchadnezzar in a fit of rage
DAN.3.14	 Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don’t serve my gods and that you don’t pay homage to the golden statue that I erected? 
DAN.3.15	 Now if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music
DAN.3.16	 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to King Nebuchadnezzar,
DAN.3.17	 If
DAN.3.18	 But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we don’t serve your gods, and we will not pay homage to the golden statue that you have erected.”
DAN.3.19	 Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and his disposition changed
DAN.3.20	 He ordered strong
DAN.3.21	 So those men were tied up while still wearing their cloaks, trousers, turbans, and other clothes,
DAN.3.22	 But since the king’s command was so urgent, and the furnace was so excessively hot, the men who escorted
DAN.3.23	 But those three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell into the furnace
DAN.3.24	 Then King Nebuchadnezzar was startled and quickly got up. He said to his ministers, “Wasn’t it three men that we tied up and threw
DAN.3.25	 He answered, “But I see four men, untied and walking around in the midst of the fire! No harm has come to them! And the appearance of the fourth is like that of a god!”
DAN.3.26	 Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire. He called out,
DAN.3.26	Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego emerged from the fire.
DAN.3.27	 Once the satraps, prefects, governors, and ministers of the king had gathered around, they saw that those men were physically
DAN.3.28	 Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed,
DAN.3.29	 I hereby decree
DAN.3.30	 Then Nebuchadnezzar
DAN.4.2	 I am delighted to tell you about the signs and wonders that the most high God has done for me. 
DAN.4.3	 “How great are his signs! 
DAN.4.3	How mighty are his wonders! 
DAN.4.3	His kingdom will last forever,
DAN.4.3	and his authority continues from one generation to the next.”
DAN.4.5	 I saw a dream that
DAN.4.6	 So I issued an order
DAN.4.7	 When the magicians, astrologers, wise men, and diviners entered, I recounted the dream for them. But they were unable to make known its interpretation to me. 
DAN.4.8	 Later Daniel entered (whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god,
DAN.4.9	 saying, “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, in whom I know there to be a spirit of the holy gods and whom no mystery baffles, consider
DAN.4.10	 Here are the visions of my mind
DAN.4.10	While I was watching,
DAN.4.10	there was a tree in the middle of the land.
DAN.4.10	It was enormously tall.
DAN.4.11	 The tree grew large and strong.
DAN.4.11	Its top reached far into the sky;
DAN.4.11	it could be seen
DAN.4.12	 Its foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful;
DAN.4.12	on it there was food enough for all.
DAN.4.12	Under it the wild animals
DAN.4.12	and in its branches the birds of the sky used to nest.
DAN.4.12	All creatures
DAN.4.13	 While I was watching in my mind’s visions
DAN.4.13	a holy sentinel
DAN.4.14	 He called out loudly
DAN.4.14	‘Chop down the tree and lop off its branches!
DAN.4.14	Strip off its foliage
DAN.4.14	and scatter its fruit!
DAN.4.14	Let the animals flee from under it
DAN.4.14	and the birds from its branches!
DAN.4.15	 But leave its taproot
DAN.4.15	with a band of iron and bronze around it
DAN.4.15	surrounded by the grass of the field.
DAN.4.15	Let it become damp with the dew of the sky,
DAN.4.15	and let it live with
DAN.4.16	 Let his mind
DAN.4.16	and let an animal’s mind be given to him,
DAN.4.16	and let seven periods of time
DAN.4.17	 This announcement is by the decree of the sentinels;
DAN.4.17	this decision is by the pronouncement of the holy ones, 
DAN.4.17	so that
DAN.4.17	that the Most High has authority over human kingdoms,
DAN.4.17	and he bestows them on whomever he wishes.
DAN.4.17	He establishes over them even the lowliest of human beings.’
DAN.4.18	 “This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its
DAN.4.19	 Then Daniel (whose name is also Belteshazzar) was upset for a brief time;
DAN.4.20	 The tree that you saw that grew large and strong, whose top reached to the sky, and which could be seen
DAN.4.21	 whose foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful, and from which there was food available for all, under whose branches wild animals
DAN.4.22	 it is you,
DAN.4.23	 As for the king seeing a holy sentinel coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave its taproot in the ground, with a band of iron and bronze around it, surrounded by the grass of the field. Let it become damp with the dew of the sky, and let it live with the wild animals, until seven periods of time go by for him’ – 
DAN.4.24	 this is the interpretation, O king! It is the decision of the Most High that this has happened to my lord the king. 
DAN.4.25	 You will be driven
DAN.4.26	 They said to leave the taproot of the tree, for your kingdom will be restored to you when you come to understand that heaven
DAN.4.27	 Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you. Break away from your sins by doing what is right, and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps your prosperity will be prolonged.”
DAN.4.28	 Now all of this happened
DAN.4.29	 After twelve months, he happened to be walking around on the battlements
DAN.4.30	 The king uttered these words: “Is this not the great Babylon that I have built for a royal residence
DAN.4.31	 While these words were still on the king’s lips,
DAN.4.32	 You will be driven from human society, and you will live with the wild animals. You will be fed grass like oxen, and seven periods of time will pass by for you before
DAN.4.33	 Now in that very moment
DAN.4.34	 But at the end of the appointed time
DAN.4.34	I extolled the Most High, 
DAN.4.34	and I praised and glorified the one who lives forever. 
DAN.4.34	For his authority is an everlasting authority, 
DAN.4.34	and his kingdom extends from one generation to the next.
DAN.4.35	 All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing.
DAN.4.35	He does as he wishes with the army of heaven
DAN.4.35	and with those who inhabit the earth.
DAN.4.35	No one slaps
DAN.4.35	and says to him, ‘What have you done?’
DAN.4.36	 At that time my sanity returned to me. I was restored
DAN.4.37	 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, for all his deeds are right and his ways are just. He is able to bring down those who live
DAN.5.1	 King Belshazzar
DAN.5.2	 While under the influence
DAN.5.3	 So they brought the gold and silver
DAN.5.4	 As they drank wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
DAN.5.5	 At that very moment the fingers of a human hand appeared
DAN.5.6	 Then all the color drained from the king’s face
DAN.5.7	 The king called out loudly
DAN.5.8	 So all the king’s wise men came in, but they were unable to read the writing or to make known its
DAN.5.9	 Then King Belshazzar was very terrified, and he was visibly shaken.
DAN.5.10	 Due to the noise
DAN.5.11	 There is a man in your kingdom who has within him a spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, he proved to have
DAN.5.12	 Thus there was found in this man Daniel, whom the king renamed Belteshazzar, an extraordinary spirit, knowledge, and skill to interpret
DAN.5.13	 So Daniel was brought in before the king. The king said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the captives of Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah? 
DAN.5.14	 I have heard about you, how there is a spirit of the gods in you, and how you have
DAN.5.15	 Now the wise men and
DAN.5.16	 However, I have heard
DAN.5.17	 But Daniel replied to the king, “Keep your gifts, and give your rewards to someone else! However, I will read the writing for the king and make known its
DAN.5.18	 As for you, O king, the most high God bestowed on your father Nebuchadnezzar a kingdom, greatness, honor, and majesty.
DAN.5.19	 Due to the greatness that he bestowed on him, all peoples, nations, and language groups were trembling with fear
DAN.5.20	 And when his mind
DAN.5.21	 He was driven from human society, his mind
DAN.5.22	 “But you, his son
DAN.5.23	 Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. You brought before you the vessels from his temple, and you and your nobles, together with your wives and concubines, drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone – gods
DAN.5.24	 Therefore the palm of a hand was sent from him, and this writing was inscribed. 
DAN.5.25	 “This is the writing that was inscribed: 
DAN.5.26	 This is the interpretation of the words:
DAN.5.27	 As for 
DAN.5.28	 As for 
DAN.5.29	 Then, on Belshazzar’s orders,
DAN.5.30	 And in that very night Belshazzar, the Babylonian king,
DAN.6.1	 It seemed like a good idea to Darius
DAN.6.2	 Over them would be three supervisors, one of whom was Daniel. These satraps were accountable
DAN.6.3	 Now this Daniel was distinguishing himself above the other supervisors and the satraps, for he had an extraordinary spirit. In fact, the king intended to appoint him over the entire kingdom. 
DAN.6.4	 Consequently the supervisors and satraps were trying to find
DAN.6.5	 So these men concluded,
DAN.6.6	 So these supervisors and satraps came by collusion
DAN.6.7	 To all the supervisors of the kingdom, the prefects, satraps, counselors, and governors it seemed like a good idea for a royal edict to be issued and an interdict to be enforced. For the next thirty days anyone who prays
DAN.6.8	 Now let the king issue a written interdict
DAN.6.9	 So King Darius issued the written interdict.
DAN.6.10	 When Daniel realized
DAN.6.11	 Then those officials who had gone to the king
DAN.6.12	 So they approached the king and said to him,
DAN.6.13	 Then they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the captives
DAN.6.14	 When the king heard this,
DAN.6.15	 Then those men came by collusion to the king and
DAN.6.16	 So the king gave the order,
DAN.6.17	 Then a stone was brought and placed over the opening
DAN.6.18	 Then the king departed to his palace. But he spent the night without eating, and no diversions
DAN.6.19	 In the morning, at the earliest sign of daylight, the king got up and rushed to the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.20	 As he approached the den, he called out to Daniel in a worried voice,
DAN.6.21	 Then Daniel spoke to
DAN.6.22	 My God sent his angel and closed the lions’ mouths so that they have not harmed me, because I was found to be innocent before him. Nor have I done any harm to you, O king.”
DAN.6.23	 Then the king was delighted and gave an order to haul Daniel up from the den. So Daniel was hauled up out of the den. He had no injury of any kind, because he had trusted in his God. 
DAN.6.24	 The king gave another order,
DAN.6.25	 Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and language groups who were living in all the land: “Peace and prosperity!
DAN.6.26	 I have issued an edict that throughout all the dominion of my kingdom people are to revere and fear the God of Daniel. 
DAN.6.26	“For he is the living God;
DAN.6.26	he endures forever.
DAN.6.26	His kingdom will not be destroyed;
DAN.6.26	his authority is forever.
DAN.6.27	 He rescues and delivers 
DAN.6.27	and performs signs and wonders
DAN.6.27	in the heavens and on the earth.
DAN.6.27	He has rescued Daniel from the power
DAN.6.28	 So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and
DAN.7.1	 In the first
DAN.7.2	 Daniel explained:
DAN.7.3	 Then four large beasts came up from the sea; they were different from one another.
DAN.7.4	 “The first one was like a lion with eagles’ wings. As I watched, its wings were pulled off and it was lifted up from the ground. It was made to stand on two feet like a human being, and a human mind
DAN.7.5	 “Then
DAN.7.6	 “After these things,
DAN.7.7	 “After these things, as I was watching in the night visions
DAN.7.8	 “As I was contemplating the horns, another horn – a small one – came up between them, and three of the former horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it.
DAN.7.9	 “While I was watching,
DAN.7.9	thrones were set up,
DAN.7.9	and the Ancient of Days
DAN.7.9	His attire was white like snow;
DAN.7.9	the hair of his head was like lamb’s
DAN.7.9	His throne was ablaze with fire
DAN.7.9	and its wheels were all aflame.
DAN.7.10	 A river of fire was streaming forth
DAN.7.10	and proceeding from his presence.
DAN.7.10	Many thousands were ministering to him;
DAN.7.10	Many tens of thousands stood ready to serve him.
DAN.7.10	The court convened
DAN.7.10	and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	 “Then I kept on watching because of the arrogant words of the horn that was speaking. I was watching
DAN.7.12	 As for the rest of the beasts, their ruling authority had already been removed, though they were permitted to go on living
DAN.7.13	 I was watching in the night visions,
DAN.7.13	“And with
DAN.7.13	one like a son of man
DAN.7.13	He went up to the Ancient of Days
DAN.7.13	and was escorted
DAN.7.14	 To him was given ruling authority, honor, and sovereignty.
DAN.7.14	All peoples, nations, and language groups were serving
DAN.7.14	His authority is eternal and will not pass away.
DAN.7.14	His kingdom will not be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	 “As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed,
DAN.7.16	 I approached one of those standing nearby and asked him about the meaning
DAN.7.17	 ‘These large beasts, which are four in number, represent four kings who will arise from the earth. 
DAN.7.18	 The holy ones
DAN.7.19	 “Then I wanted to know the meaning
DAN.7.20	 I also wanted to know
DAN.7.21	 While I was watching, that horn began to wage war against the holy ones and was defeating
DAN.7.22	 until the Ancient of Days arrived and judgment was rendered
DAN.7.23	 “This is what he told me:
DAN.7.23	‘The fourth beast means that there will be a fourth kingdom on earth
DAN.7.23	that will differ from all the other kingdoms.
DAN.7.23	It will devour all the earth
DAN.7.23	and will trample and crush it.
DAN.7.24	 The ten horns
DAN.7.24	mean that ten kings will arise from that kingdom.
DAN.7.24	Another king will arise after them,
DAN.7.24	but he will be different from the earlier ones.
DAN.7.24	He will humiliate
DAN.7.25	 He will speak words against the Most High.
DAN.7.25	He will harass
DAN.7.25	His intention
DAN.7.25	They will be delivered into his hand
DAN.7.25	For a time, times,
DAN.7.26	 But the court will convene,
DAN.7.26	destroyed and abolished forever!
DAN.7.27	 Then the kingdom, authority,
DAN.7.27	and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven
DAN.7.27	will be delivered to the people of the holy ones
DAN.7.27	His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; 
DAN.7.27	all authorities will serve him and obey him.’
DAN.7.28	 “This is the conclusion of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and the color drained from my face.
DAN.8.1	 In the third year
DAN.8.2	 In this
DAN.8.3	 I looked up
DAN.8.4	 I saw that the ram was butting westward, northward, and southward. No animal
DAN.8.5	 While I was contemplating all this,
DAN.8.6	 It came to the two-horned ram that I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed against it with raging strength.
DAN.8.7	 I saw it approaching the ram. It went into a fit of rage against the ram
DAN.8.8	 The male goat acted even more arrogantly. But no sooner had the large horn become strong than it was broken, and there arose four conspicuous horns
DAN.8.9	 From one of them came a small horn.
DAN.8.10	 It grew so big it reached the army
DAN.8.11	 It also acted arrogantly against the Prince of the army,
DAN.8.12	 The army was given over,
DAN.8.13	 Then I heard a holy one
DAN.8.14	 He said to me, “To 2,300 evenings and mornings;
DAN.8.15	 While I, Daniel, was watching the vision, I sought to understand it. Now one who appeared to be a man was standing before me. 
DAN.8.16	 Then I heard a human voice coming from between the banks of the Ulai. It called out, “Gabriel,
DAN.8.17	 So he approached the place where I was standing. As he came, I felt terrified and fell flat on the ground.
DAN.8.18	 As he spoke with me, I fell into a trance with my face to the ground. But he touched me and stood me upright.
DAN.8.19	 Then he said, “I am going to inform you about what will happen in the latter time of wrath, for the vision
DAN.8.20	 The ram that you saw with the two horns stands for the kings of Media and Persia. 
DAN.8.21	 The male goat
DAN.8.22	 The horn that was broken
DAN.8.23	 Toward the end of their rule, when rebellious acts
DAN.8.24	 His power will be great, but it will not be by his strength alone. He will cause terrible destruction.
DAN.8.25	 By his treachery
DAN.8.26	 The vision of the evenings and mornings that was told to you is correct.
DAN.8.27	 I, Daniel, was exhausted
DAN.9.1	 In the first year of Darius
DAN.9.2	 in the first year of his reign
DAN.9.3	 So I turned my attention
DAN.9.4	 I prayed to the 
DAN.9.4	“O Lord,
DAN.9.5	 we have sinned! We have done what is wrong and wicked; we have rebelled by turning away from your commandments and standards. 
DAN.9.6	 We have not paid attention to your servants the prophets, who spoke by your authority
DAN.9.7	 “You are righteous,
DAN.9.8	 O 
DAN.9.9	 Yet the Lord our God is compassionate and forgiving,
DAN.9.10	 We have not obeyed
DAN.9.11	 “All Israel has broken

DAN.9.19	 O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, pay attention, and act! Don’t delay, for your own sake, O my God! For your city and your people are called by your name.”
DAN.9.20	 While I was still speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my request before the 
DAN.9.21	 yes, while I was still praying,
DAN.9.22	 He spoke with me, instructing me as follows:
DAN.9.23	 At the beginning of your requests a message went out, and I have come to convey it to you, for you are of great value in God’s sight.
DAN.9.24	 “Seventy weeks
DAN.9.24	concerning your people and your holy city
DAN.9.24	to put an end to
DAN.9.24	to bring sin
DAN.9.24	to atone for iniquity,
DAN.9.24	to bring in perpetual
DAN.9.24	to seal up
DAN.9.24	and to anoint a most holy place.
DAN.9.25	 So know and understand:
DAN.9.25	From the issuing of the command
DAN.9.25	Jerusalem
DAN.9.25	there will be a period of seven weeks
DAN.9.25	It will again be built,
DAN.9.25	but in distressful times.
DAN.9.26	 Now after the sixty-two weeks, 
DAN.9.26	an anointed one will be cut off and have nothing.
DAN.9.26	As for the city and the sanctuary,
DAN.9.26	the people of the coming prince will destroy
DAN.9.26	But his end will come speedily
DAN.9.26	Until the end of the war that has been decreed
DAN.9.26	there will be destruction.
DAN.9.27	 He will confirm a covenant with many for one week.
DAN.9.27	But in the middle of that week
DAN.9.27	he will bring sacrifices and offerings to a halt.
DAN.9.27	On the wing
DAN.9.27	until the decreed end is poured out on the one who destroys.”
DAN.10.1	 In the third
DAN.10.2	 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three whole weeks.
DAN.10.3	 I ate no choice food; no meat or wine came to my lips,
DAN.10.4	 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month
DAN.10.5	 I looked up
DAN.10.6	 His body resembled yellow jasper,
DAN.10.7	 Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men who were with me did not see it.
DAN.10.8	 I alone was left to see this great vision. My strength drained from
DAN.10.9	 I listened to his voice,
DAN.10.10	 Then
DAN.10.11	 He said to me, “Daniel, you are of great value.
DAN.10.12	 Then he said to me, “Don’t be afraid, Daniel, for from the very first day you applied your mind
DAN.10.13	 However, the prince of the kingdom of Persia was opposing me for twenty-one days. But
DAN.10.14	 Now I have come to help you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to future days.”
DAN.10.15	 While he was saying this to me,
DAN.10.16	 Then
DAN.10.17	 How, sir, am I able to speak with you?
DAN.10.18	 Then the one who appeared to be a human being touched me again
DAN.10.19	 He said to me, “Don’t be afraid, you who are valued.
DAN.10.20	 He said, “Do you know why I have come to you?
DAN.10.21	 However, I will first tell you what is written in a dependable book.
DAN.11.1	 And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I
DAN.11.2	 Now I will tell you the truth.

DAN.11.12	 When the army is taken away, the king of the south will become arrogant.
DAN.11.13	 For the king of the north will again muster an army, one larger than before. At the end of some years he will advance with a huge army and enormous supplies. 
DAN.11.14	 “In those times many will oppose

DAN.11.25	 He will rouse his strength and enthusiasm
DAN.11.26	 Those who share the king’s fine food will attempt to destroy him, and his army will be swept away;

DAN.11.33	 These who are wise among the people will teach the masses.
DAN.11.34	 When they stumble, they will be granted some help. But many will unite with them deceitfully. 
DAN.11.35	 Even some of the wise will stumble, resulting in their refinement, purification, and cleansing until the time of the end, for it is still for the appointed time.
DAN.11.36	 “Then the king
DAN.11.37	 He will not respect
DAN.11.38	 What he will honor is a god of fortresses – a god his fathers did not acknowledge he will honor with gold, silver, valuable stones, and treasured commodities.

DAN.11.43	 He will have control over the hidden stores of gold and silver, as well as all the treasures of Egypt. Libyans and Ethiopians
DAN.11.44	 But reports will trouble him from the east and north, and he will set out in a tremendous rage to destroy and wipe out many. 
DAN.11.45	 He will pitch his royal tents between the seas

DAN.12.1	the great prince who watches over your people,

DAN.12.5	 I, Daniel, watched as two others stood there, one on each side of the river.
DAN.12.6	 One said to the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river, “When will the end of these wondrous events occur?” 
DAN.12.7	 Then I heard the man clothed in linen who was over the waters of the river as he raised both his right and left hands to the sky

HOS.2.3	so that I might kill
HOS.2.4	 I will have no pity on her children,

HOS.2.11	all her appointed festivals.
HOS.2.12	 I will destroy her vines and fig trees,

HOS.4.3	The wild animals,
HOS.4.3	and even the fish in the sea will perish.
HOS.4.4	 Do not let anyone accuse or contend against anyone else:
HOS.4.4	for my case is against you priests!
HOS.4.5	 You stumble day and night, 
HOS.4.5	and the false prophets stumble with you;
HOS.4.5	You have destroyed your own people!
HOS.4.6	 You have destroyed
HOS.4.6	by failing to acknowledge me! 
HOS.4.6	Because you refuse to acknowledge me,
HOS.4.6	I will reject you as my priests.
HOS.4.6	Because you reject
HOS.4.6	I will reject
HOS.4.7	 The more the priests increased in numbers, 
HOS.4.7	the more they rebelled against me.
HOS.4.7	They have turned
HOS.4.7	into a shameful disgrace!
HOS.4.8	 They feed on the sin offerings of my people;
HOS.4.8	their appetites long for their iniquity!
HOS.4.9	 I will deal with the people and priests together:
HOS.4.9	I will punish them both for their ways, 
HOS.4.9	and I will repay them for their deeds.
HOS.4.10	 They will eat, but not be satisfied;
HOS.4.10	they will engage in prostitution, but not increase in numbers;
HOS.4.10	because they have abandoned the 
HOS.4.10	by pursuing other gods.
HOS.4.11	 Old and new wine 
HOS.4.11	take away the understanding of my people.
HOS.4.12	 They consult their wooden idols, 
HOS.4.12	and their diviner’s staff answers with an oracle.
HOS.4.12	The wind of prostitution blows them astray;
HOS.4.12	they commit spiritual adultery
HOS.4.13	 They sacrifice on the mountaintops, 
HOS.4.13	and burn offerings on the hills;
HOS.4.13	they sacrifice
HOS.4.13	because their shade is so pleasant.
HOS.4.13	As a result, your daughters have become cult prostitutes,
HOS.4.13	and your daughters-in-law commit adultery! 
HOS.4.14	 I will not punish your daughters when they commit prostitution,
HOS.4.14	nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.
HOS.4.14	For the men consort with harlots, 
HOS.4.14	they sacrifice with temple prostitutes.
HOS.4.14	It is true:
HOS.4.15	 Although you, O Israel, commit adultery,
HOS.4.15	do not let Judah become guilty!
HOS.4.15	Do not journey to Gilgal! 
HOS.4.15	Do not go up to Beth Aven!
HOS.4.15	Do not swear, “As surely as the 
HOS.4.16	 Israel has rebelled
HOS.4.16	Soon
HOS.4.16	like a lamb in a broad field!
HOS.4.17	 Ephraim has attached himself to idols;

HOS.4.19	 A whirlwind has wrapped them in its wings;
HOS.4.19	they will be brought to shame because of their idolatrous worship.
HOS.5.1	 Hear this, you priests! 
HOS.5.1	Pay attention, you Israelites!
HOS.5.1	Listen closely,
HOS.5.1	For judgment is about to overtake you!
HOS.5.1	For you were like a trap
HOS.5.1	like a net
HOS.5.2	 Those who revolt are knee-deep in slaughter,

HOS.5.3	Israel has defiled itself.
HOS.5.4	 Their wicked deeds do not allow them to return to their God;
HOS.5.4	because a spirit of idolatry
HOS.5.4	and they do not acknowledge the 
HOS.5.5	 The arrogance of Israel testifies against it;
HOS.5.5	Israel and Ephraim will be overthrown
HOS.5.5	Even Judah will be brought down
HOS.5.6	 Although they bring their flocks and herds
HOS.5.6	to seek
HOS.5.6	They will not find him – 
HOS.5.6	he has withdrawn himself from them!
HOS.5.7	 They have committed treason
HOS.5.7	because they bore illegitimate children.
HOS.5.7	Soon
HOS.5.8	 Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah! 
HOS.5.8	Sound the trumpet in Ramah!
HOS.5.8	Sound the alarm in Beth Aven!
HOS.5.8	Tremble in fear,
HOS.5.9	 Ephraim will be ruined in the day of judgment!
HOS.5.9	What I am declaring
HOS.5.10	 The princes of Judah are like those who move boundary markers.
HOS.5.10	I will pour out my rage on them like a torrential flood!
HOS.5.11	 Ephraim will be oppressed,
HOS.5.11	because he was determined to pursue worthless idols.
HOS.5.12	 I will be like a moth to Ephraim, 
HOS.5.12	like wood rot
HOS.5.13	 When Ephraim saw
HOS.5.13	and Judah saw his wound,
HOS.5.13	then Ephraim turned
HOS.5.13	and begged
HOS.5.13	But he will not be able to heal you! 
HOS.5.13	He cannot cure your wound!
HOS.5.14	 I will be like a lion to Ephraim,
HOS.5.14	like a young lion to the house of Judah.
HOS.5.14	I myself will tear them to pieces,
HOS.5.14	then I will carry them off, and no one will be able to rescue them!
HOS.5.15	 Then I will return again to my lair 
HOS.5.15	until they have suffered their punishment.
HOS.5.15	Then they will seek me;
HOS.5.15	in their distress they will earnestly seek me.
HOS.6.1	 “Come on! Let’s return to the 
HOS.6.1	He himself has torn us to pieces, 
HOS.6.1	but he will heal us!
HOS.6.1	He has injured
HOS.6.1	but he will bandage our wounds!
HOS.6.2	 He will restore
HOS.6.2	he will heal us in a little while,
HOS.6.2	so that we may live in his presence.
HOS.6.3	 So let us acknowledge him!
HOS.6.3	Let us seek
HOS.6.3	He will come to our rescue as certainly as the appearance of the dawn,
HOS.6.3	as certainly as the winter rain comes,
HOS.6.3	as certainly as the spring rain that waters the land.”
HOS.6.4	 What am I going to do with you, O Ephraim?
HOS.6.4	What am I going to do with you, O Judah?
HOS.6.4	For
HOS.6.4	it disappears as quickly as dawn’s dew!
HOS.6.5	 Therefore, I will certainly cut
HOS.6.5	I will certainly kill you
HOS.6.5	for
HOS.6.6	 For I delight in faithfulness, not simply in sacrifice;
HOS.6.6	I delight
HOS.6.7	 At Adam
HOS.6.7	Oh how
HOS.6.8	 Gilead is a city full of evildoers;
HOS.6.8	its streets are stained with bloody footprints!
HOS.6.9	 The company of priests is like a gang of robbers,
HOS.6.9	lying in ambush to pounce on a victim.
HOS.6.9	They commit murder on the road to Shechem;
HOS.6.9	they have done heinous crimes!
HOS.6.10	 I have seen a disgusting thing in the temple of Israel:
HOS.6.10	there Ephraim practices temple prostitution
HOS.6.10	and Judah defiles itself.
HOS.6.11	 I have appointed a time to reap judgment
HOS.6.11	Whenever I want to restore the fortunes of my people,
HOS.7.1	 whenever I want to heal Israel,
HOS.7.1	the sin of Ephraim is revealed,
HOS.7.1	and the evil deeds of Samaria are exposed.
HOS.7.1	For they do what is wrong;
HOS.7.1	thieves break into houses,
HOS.7.1	and gangs rob people out in the streets.
HOS.7.2	 They do not realize
HOS.7.2	that I remember all of their wicked deeds.
HOS.7.2	Their evil deeds have now surrounded them;
HOS.7.2	their sinful deeds are always before me.
HOS.7.3	 The royal advisers delight the king with their evil schemes,
HOS.7.3	the princes make him glad with their lies.
HOS.7.4	 They are all like bakers,
HOS.7.4	they
HOS.7.4	they are like a baker who does not stoke the fire
HOS.7.4	until the kneaded dough is ready for baking.
HOS.7.5	 At the celebration
HOS.7.5	his princes become inflamed
HOS.7.5	they conspire
HOS.7.6	 They approach him, all the while plotting against him.
HOS.7.6	Their hearts are like an oven;
HOS.7.6	their anger smolders all night long,
HOS.7.6	but in the morning it bursts into a flaming fire.
HOS.7.7	 All of them are blazing like an oven;
HOS.7.7	they devour their rulers.
HOS.7.7	All of their kings fall – 
HOS.7.7	and none of them call on me!
HOS.7.8	 Ephraim has mixed itself like flour
HOS.7.8	Ephraim is like a ruined cake of bread that is scorched on one side.
HOS.7.9	 Foreigners are consuming what his strenuous labor produced,
HOS.7.9	but he does not recognize it!
HOS.7.9	His head is filled with gray hair,
HOS.7.9	but he does not realize it!
HOS.7.10	 The arrogance of Israel testifies against him,
HOS.7.10	yet they refuse to return to the 
HOS.7.10	In spite of all this they refuse to seek him!
HOS.7.11	 Ephraim has been like a dove, 
HOS.7.11	easily deceived and lacking discernment.
HOS.7.11	They called to Egypt for help;
HOS.7.11	they turned to Assyria for protection.
HOS.7.12	 I will throw my bird net over them while they are flying,
HOS.7.12	I will bring them down like birds in the sky;
HOS.7.12	I will discipline them when I hear them flocking together.
HOS.7.13	 Woe to them! For they have fled from me!
HOS.7.13	Destruction to them! For they have rebelled against me!
HOS.7.13	I want to deliver
HOS.7.13	but they have lied to me.
HOS.7.14	 They do not pray to me,
HOS.7.14	but howl in distress on their beds;
HOS.7.14	They slash themselves
HOS.7.14	but turn away from me.
HOS.7.15	 Although I trained and strengthened them,
HOS.7.15	they plot evil against me!
HOS.7.16	 They turn to Baal;
HOS.7.16	they are like an unreliable bow. 
HOS.7.16	Their leaders will fall by the sword
HOS.7.16	because their prayers to Baal
HOS.7.16	So people will disdain them in the land of Egypt.
HOS.8.1	 Sound the alarm!
HOS.8.1	An eagle
HOS.8.1	For they have broken their covenant with me,
HOS.8.1	and have rebelled against my law.
HOS.8.2	 Israel cries out to me,
HOS.8.2	“My God, we acknowledge you!”
HOS.8.3	 But Israel has rejected what is morally good;
HOS.8.3	so an enemy will pursue him.
HOS.8.4	 They enthroned kings without my consent!
HOS.8.4	They appointed princes without my approval!
HOS.8.4	They made idols out of their silver and gold,
HOS.8.4	but they will be destroyed!
HOS.8.5	 O Samaria, he has rejected your calf idol!
HOS.8.5	My anger burns against them!
HOS.8.5	They will not survive much longer without being punished,
HOS.8.5	even though they are Israelites!
HOS.8.6	 That idol was made by a workman – it is not God!
HOS.8.6	The calf idol of Samaria will be broken to bits.
HOS.8.7	 They sow the wind,
HOS.8.7	and so they will reap the whirlwind!
HOS.8.7	The stalk does not have any standing grain;
HOS.8.7	it will not produce any flour.
HOS.8.7	Even if it were to yield grain,
HOS.8.7	foreigners would swallow it all up.
HOS.8.8	 Israel will be swallowed up among the nations;
HOS.8.8	they will be like a worthless piece of pottery.
HOS.8.9	 They have gone up to Assyria, 
HOS.8.9	like a wild donkey that wanders off.
HOS.8.9	Ephraim has hired prostitutes as lovers.
HOS.8.10	 Even though they have hired lovers among the nations,
HOS.8.10	I will soon gather them together for judgment.
HOS.8.10	Then
HOS.8.10	under the oppression of a mighty king.
HOS.8.11	 Although Ephraim has built many altars for sin offerings,
HOS.8.11	these have become altars for sinning!
HOS.8.12	 I spelled out my law for him in great detail,
HOS.8.12	but they regard it as something totally unknown
HOS.8.13	 They offer up sacrificial gifts to me,
HOS.8.13	and eat the meat,
HOS.8.13	but the 
HOS.8.13	Soon he will remember their wrongdoing,
HOS.8.13	he will punish their sins,
HOS.8.13	and they will return to Egypt.
HOS.8.14	 Israel has forgotten his Maker and built royal palaces,
HOS.8.14	and Judah has built many fortified cities.
HOS.8.14	But I will send fire on their cities;
HOS.8.14	it will consume their royal citadels.
HOS.9.1	 O Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly
HOS.9.1	for you are unfaithful
HOS.9.1	You love to receive a prostitute's wages
HOS.9.1	on all the floors where you thresh your grain.
HOS.9.2	 Threshing floors and wine vats will not feed the people,
HOS.9.2	and new wine only deceives them.
HOS.9.3	 They will not remain in the 
HOS.9.3	Ephraim will return to Egypt;
HOS.9.3	they will eat ritually unclean food in Assyria.
HOS.9.4	 They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the 
HOS.9.4	they will not please him with their sacrifices.
HOS.9.4	Their sacrifices will be like bread eaten while in mourning;
HOS.9.4	all those who eat them will make themselves ritually unclean.
HOS.9.4	For their bread will be only to satisfy their appetite;
HOS.9.4	it will not come into the temple of the 
HOS.9.5	 So what will you do on the festival day,
HOS.9.5	on the festival days of the 
HOS.9.6	 Look!
HOS.9.6	Egypt will take hold
HOS.9.6	and Memphis will bury them.
HOS.9.6	The weeds will inherit the silver they treasure
HOS.9.6	thorn bushes will occupy their homes.
HOS.9.7	 The time of judgment
HOS.9.7	The time of retribution
HOS.9.7	Let Israel know!
HOS.9.7	The prophet is considered a fool
HOS.9.7	the inspired man
HOS.9.7	because of the multitude of your sins
HOS.9.7	and your intense
HOS.9.8	 The prophet
HOS.9.8	yet traps
HOS.9.8	animosity rages against him in the land
HOS.9.9	 They have sunk deep into corruption
HOS.9.9	as in the days of Gibeah.
HOS.9.9	He will remember their wrongdoing.
HOS.9.9	He will repay them for their sins.
HOS.9.10	 When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the wilderness.
HOS.9.10	I viewed your ancestors
HOS.9.10	Then they came to Baal-Peor and they dedicated themselves to shame –
HOS.9.10	they became as detestable as what they loved.
HOS.9.11	 Ephraim will be like a bird;
HOS.9.11	what they value
HOS.9.11	They will not bear children –
HOS.9.11	they will not enjoy pregnancy –
HOS.9.11	they will not even conceive!
HOS.9.12	 Even if they raise their children, 
HOS.9.12	I will take away every last one of them.
HOS.9.12	Woe to them!
HOS.9.12	For I will turn away from them.
HOS.9.13	 Just as lion cubs are born predators,
HOS.9.13	so Ephraim will bear his sons for slaughter.
HOS.9.14	 Give them, O 
HOS.9.14	what will you give them?
HOS.9.14	Give them wombs that miscarry,
HOS.9.14	and breasts that cannot nurse!
HOS.9.15	 Because of all their evil in Gilgal,
HOS.9.15	I hate them there.
HOS.9.15	On account of their evil deeds,
HOS.9.15	I will drive them out of my land.
HOS.9.15	I will no longer love them;
HOS.9.15	all their rulers are rebels.
HOS.9.16	 Ephraim will be struck down
HOS.9.16	their root will be dried up;
HOS.9.16	they will not yield any fruit.
HOS.9.16	Even if they do bear children,
HOS.9.16	I will kill their precious offspring.
HOS.9.17	 My God will reject them,
HOS.9.17	for they have not obeyed him;
HOS.9.17	so they will be fugitives among the nations.
HOS.10.1	 Israel was a fertile vine
HOS.10.1	that yielded fruit.
HOS.10.1	As his fruit multiplied,
HOS.10.1	he multiplied altars to Baal.
HOS.10.1	As his land prospered,
HOS.10.1	they adorned the fertility pillars.
HOS.10.2	 Their heart is slipping;
HOS.10.2	soon they will be punished for their guilt.
HOS.10.2	The 
HOS.10.2	he will completely destroy their fertility pillars.
HOS.10.3	 Very soon they will say, “We have no king
HOS.10.3	since we did not fear the 
HOS.10.3	But what can a king do for us anyway?”
HOS.10.4	 They
HOS.10.4	taking
HOS.10.4	Therefore legal disputes sprout up
HOS.10.4	like poisonous weeds
HOS.10.5	 The inhabitants
HOS.10.5	Its people will mourn over it;
HOS.10.5	its idolatrous priests will wail
HOS.10.5	because its splendor will be taken from them
HOS.10.6	 Even the calf idol
HOS.10.6	as tribute for the great king.
HOS.10.6	Ephraim will be disgraced;
HOS.10.6	Israel will be put to shame because
HOS.10.7	 Samaria and its king will be carried off
HOS.10.7	like a twig
HOS.10.8	 The high places of the “House
HOS.10.8	it is the place where Israel sins.
HOS.10.8	Thorns and thistles will grow up over its altars.
HOS.10.8	Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!”
HOS.10.8	and to the hills, “Fall on us!”
HOS.10.9	 O Israel, you have sinned since the time
HOS.10.9	and there you have remained.
HOS.10.9	Did not war overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?
HOS.10.10	 When I please,
HOS.10.10	I will gather nations together to attack them,
HOS.10.10	to bind them in chains
HOS.10.11	 Ephraim was a well-trained heifer who loved to thresh grain;
HOS.10.11	I myself put a fine yoke
HOS.10.11	I will harness Ephraim.
HOS.10.11	Let Judah plow!
HOS.10.11	Let Jacob break up
HOS.10.12	 Sow righteousness for yourselves,
HOS.10.12	reap unfailing love.
HOS.10.12	Break up the unplowed ground for yourselves,
HOS.10.12	for it is time to seek the 
HOS.10.12	until he comes and showers deliverance
HOS.10.13	 But you have plowed wickedness;
HOS.10.13	you have reaped injustice;
HOS.10.13	you have eaten the fruit of deception.
HOS.10.13	Because you have depended on your chariots;
HOS.10.13	you have relied
HOS.10.14	 The roar of battle will rise against your people;
HOS.10.14	all your fortresses will be devastated,
HOS.10.14	just as Shalman devastated
HOS.10.14	when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children.
HOS.10.15	 So will it happen to you, O Bethel,
HOS.10.15	because of your great wickedness!
HOS.10.15	When that day dawns,
HOS.10.15	the king of Israel will be destroyed.
HOS.11.1	 When Israel was a young man, I loved him like a son,
HOS.11.1	and I summoned my son
HOS.11.2	 But the more I summoned
HOS.11.2	the farther they departed from me.
HOS.11.2	They sacrificed to the Baal idols
HOS.11.2	and burned incense to images.
HOS.11.3	 Yet it was I who led
HOS.11.3	I took them by the arm;
HOS.11.3	but they did not acknowledge 
HOS.11.3	that I had healed them.
HOS.11.4	 I led them with leather
HOS.11.4	with leather
HOS.11.4	I lifted the yoke
HOS.11.4	and gently fed them.
HOS.11.5	 They will return to Egypt!
HOS.11.5	Assyria will rule over them
HOS.11.5	because they refuse to repent!
HOS.11.6	 A sword will flash in their cities,
HOS.11.6	it will destroy the bars of their city gates,
HOS.11.6	and will devour them in their fortresses.
HOS.11.7	 My people are obsessed
HOS.11.7	they call to Baal,
HOS.11.8	 How can I give you up,
HOS.11.8	How can I surrender you, O Israel?
HOS.11.8	How can I treat you like Admah?
HOS.11.8	How can I make you like Zeboiim?
HOS.11.8	I have had a change of heart!
HOS.11.8	All my tender compassions are aroused!
HOS.11.9	 I cannot carry out
HOS.11.9	I cannot totally destroy Ephraim!
HOS.11.9	Because I am God, and not man – the Holy One among you – 
HOS.11.9	I will not come in wrath!
HOS.11.10	 He will roar like a lion, 
HOS.11.10	and they will follow the 
HOS.11.10	when he roars, 
HOS.11.10	his children will come trembling
HOS.11.11	 They will return in fear and trembling
HOS.11.11	like birds from Egypt,
HOS.11.11	like doves from Assyria,
HOS.11.11	and I will settle them in their homes,” declares the 
HOS.11.12	the house of Israel has surrounded me
HOS.11.12	But Judah still roams about with
HOS.11.12	he remains faithful to the Holy One.
HOS.12.1	 Ephraim continually feeds on the wind;
HOS.12.1	he chases the east wind all day;
HOS.12.1	he multiplies lies and violence.
HOS.12.1	They make treaties
HOS.12.1	and send olive oil as tribute
HOS.12.2	 The 
HOS.12.2	he will punish Jacob according to his ways
HOS.12.2	and repay him according to his deeds.
HOS.12.3	 In the womb he attacked his brother;
HOS.12.3	in his manly vigor he struggled
HOS.12.4	 He struggled
HOS.12.4	he wept and begged for his favor.
HOS.12.4	He found God
HOS.12.4	and there he spoke with him!
HOS.12.5	 As for the 
HOS.12.5	the 
HOS.12.6	 But you must return
HOS.12.6	by maintaining love and justice,
HOS.12.6	and by waiting
HOS.12.7	 The businessmen love to cheat;
HOS.12.7	they use dishonest scales.
HOS.12.8	 Ephraim boasts,
HOS.12.8	I have become wealthy!
HOS.12.8	In all that I have done to gain my wealth,
HOS.12.8	no one can accuse me of any offense
HOS.12.9	 “I am the 
HOS.12.9	I will make you live in tents again as in the days of old.
HOS.12.10	 I spoke to the prophets;
HOS.12.10	I myself revealed many visions;
HOS.12.10	I spoke in parables
HOS.12.11	 Is there idolatry
HOS.12.11	Certainly its inhabitants
HOS.12.11	Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal?
HOS.12.11	Surely their altars will be like stones heaped up on a plowed field!
HOS.12.12	 Jacob fled to the country of Aram,
HOS.12.12	then Israel worked
HOS.12.12	he tended sheep to pay for her.
HOS.12.13	 The 
HOS.12.13	and due to a prophet
HOS.12.14	 But Ephraim bitterly
HOS.12.14	so he will hold him accountable for the blood he has shed,
HOS.12.14	his Lord
HOS.13.1	 When Ephraim
HOS.13.1	he was exalted
HOS.13.1	but he became guilty by worshiping Baal and died.
HOS.13.2	 Even now they persist in sin!
HOS.13.2	They make metal images for themselves,
HOS.13.2	idols that they skillfully fashion
HOS.13.2	all of them are nothing but the work of craftsmen!
HOS.13.2	There is a saying about them:
HOS.13.2	“Those who sacrifice
HOS.13.3	 Therefore they will disappear like
HOS.13.3	like early morning dew that evaporates,
HOS.13.3	like chaff that is blown away
HOS.13.3	like smoke that disappears through an open window.
HOS.13.4	 But I am the 
HOS.13.4	who brought you out of Egypt.
HOS.13.4	Therefore, you must not acknowledge any God but me;
HOS.13.4	except me there is no Savior.
HOS.13.5	 I cared
HOS.13.5	in the dry desert where no water was.
HOS.13.6	 When they were fed,
HOS.13.6	when they were satisfied, they became proud;
HOS.13.6	as a result, they forgot me!
HOS.13.7	 So
HOS.13.7	like a leopard I will lurk by the path.
HOS.13.8	 I will attack them like a bear robbed of her cubs – 
HOS.13.8	I will rip open their chests.
HOS.13.8	I will devour them there like a lion – 
HOS.13.8	like a wild animal would tear them apart.
HOS.13.9	 I will destroy you,
HOS.13.9	Who
HOS.13.10	 Where
HOS.13.10	that he may save you in all your cities?
HOS.13.10	Where are
HOS.13.10	“Give me a king and princes”?
HOS.13.11	 I granted
HOS.13.11	and I will take him away in my wrath!
HOS.13.12	 The punishment
HOS.13.12	his punishment is being stored up for the future.
HOS.13.13	 The labor pains of a woman will overtake him,
HOS.13.13	but the baby will lack wisdom;
HOS.13.13	when the time arrives,
HOS.13.13	he will not come out of the womb!
HOS.13.14	 Will I deliver them from the power of Sheol? No, I will not!
HOS.13.14	Will I redeem them from death? No, I will not!
HOS.13.14	O Death, bring on your plagues!
HOS.13.14	O Sheol, bring on your destruction!
HOS.13.14	My eyes will not show any compassion!
HOS.13.15	 Even though he flourishes like a reed plant,
HOS.13.15	a scorching east wind will come,
HOS.13.15	a wind from the 
HOS.13.15	As a result, his spring will dry up;
HOS.13.15	his well will become dry.
HOS.13.15	That wind
HOS.13.15	in the containers in his storehouse.
HOS.13.16	because she rebelled against her God.
HOS.13.16	They will fall by the sword,
HOS.13.16	their infants will be dashed to the ground – 
HOS.13.16	their
HOS.14.1	 Return, O Israel, to the 
HOS.14.1	for your sin has been your downfall!
HOS.14.2	 Return to the 
HOS.14.2	Say to him: “Completely
HOS.14.2	accept
HOS.14.2	that we may offer the praise of our lips as sacrificial bulls.
HOS.14.3	 Assyria cannot save us;
HOS.14.3	we will not ride warhorses.
HOS.14.3	We will never again say, ‘Our gods’
HOS.14.3	to what our own hands have made.
HOS.14.3	For only you will show compassion to Orphan Israel!”
HOS.14.4	 “I will heal their waywardness
HOS.14.4	and love them freely,
HOS.14.4	for my anger will turn
HOS.14.5	 I will be like the dew to Israel;
HOS.14.5	he will blossom like a lily,
HOS.14.5	he will send down his roots like a cedar of
HOS.14.6	 His young shoots will grow;
HOS.14.6	his splendor will be like an olive tree,
HOS.14.6	his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon.
HOS.14.7	 People will reside again
HOS.14.7	they will plant and harvest grain in abundance.
HOS.14.7	They will blossom like a vine,
HOS.14.7	and his fame will be like the wine from Lebanon.
HOS.14.8	 O Ephraim, I do not want to have anything to do
HOS.14.8	I will answer him and care for him.
HOS.14.8	I am like
HOS.14.8	your fruitfulness comes from me!
HOS.14.9	 Who is wise? 
HOS.14.9	Let him discern
HOS.14.9	Who is discerning? 
HOS.14.9	Let him understand them!
HOS.14.9	For the ways of the 
HOS.14.9	the godly walk in them,
HOS.14.9	but in them the rebellious stumble.
JOL.1.1	 This

JOL.1.10	 The crops of the fields
JOL.1.10	The ground is in mourning because the grain has perished.
JOL.1.10	The fresh wine has dried up;
JOL.1.10	the olive oil languishes.
JOL.1.11	 Be distressed,
JOL.1.11	wail, vinedressers, over the wheat and the barley.
JOL.1.11	For the harvest of the field has perished. 
JOL.1.12	 The vine has dried up;
JOL.1.12	the fig tree languishes –

JOL.1.13	Wail, you who minister at the altar!
JOL.1.13	Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you servants of my God,

JOL.1.16	 Our food has been cut off right before our eyes!
JOL.1.16	There is no longer any joy or gladness in the temple of our God!
JOL.1.17	 The grains of seed
JOL.1.17	Storehouses have been decimated
JOL.1.17	and granaries have been torn down, for the grain has dried up.
JOL.1.18	 Listen to the cattle groan!

JOL.2.3	 Like fire they devour everything in their path;

JOL.2.3	The land looks like the Garden of Eden
JOL.2.3	but behind them there is only a desolate wilderness – 
JOL.2.3	for nothing escapes them!
JOL.2.4	 They look like horses;

JOL.2.5	 They sound like
JOL.2.5	like the crackling
JOL.2.5	like the noise of
JOL.2.6	 People

JOL.2.27	 You will be convinced that I am in the midst of Israel.
JOL.2.27	I am the

JOL.2.28	I will pour out my Spirit
JOL.2.28	Your sons and daughters will prophesy.
JOL.2.28	Your elderly will have revelatory dreams;
JOL.2.28	your young men will see prophetic visions.
JOL.2.29	 Even on male and female servants
JOL.2.29	I will pour out my Spirit in those days.
JOL.2.30	 I will produce portents both in the sky
JOL.2.30	blood, fire, and columns of smoke.
JOL.2.31	 The sunlight will be turned to darkness

JOL.2.32	just as the 
JOL.2.32	the remnant
JOL.3.1	I will return the exiles
JOL.3.2	 Then I will gather all the nations,
JOL.3.2	and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat.
JOL.3.2	I will enter into judgment
JOL.3.2	concerning my people Israel who are my inheritance,
JOL.3.2	whom they scattered among the nations.
JOL.3.2	They partitioned my land,
JOL.3.3	 and they cast lots for my people.
JOL.3.3	They traded
JOL.3.3	they sold a little girl for wine so they could drink.
JOL.3.4	 Why are you doing these things to me, Tyre and Sidon?
JOL.3.4	Are you trying to get even with me, land of Philistia?
JOL.3.4	I will very quickly repay you for what you have done!
JOL.3.5	 For you took my silver and my gold
JOL.3.5	and brought my precious valuables to your own palaces.
JOL.3.6	 You sold Judeans and Jerusalemites to the Greeks,
JOL.3.6	removing them far from their own country.
JOL.3.7	 Look! I am rousing them from that place to which you sold them.
JOL.3.7	I will repay you for what you have done!

JOL.3.19	 Egypt will be desolate
JOL.3.19	and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,
JOL.3.19	because of the violence they did to the people of Judah,
JOL.3.19	in whose land they shed innocent blood.
JOL.3.20	 But Judah will reside securely forever,
JOL.3.20	and Jerusalem will be secure
JOL.3.21	 I will avenge
JOL.3.21	It is the 
AMO.1.1	 The following is a record of what Amos prophesied.
AMO.1.2	 Amos
AMO.1.2	“The 
AMO.1.2	from Jerusalem
AMO.1.2	The shepherds’ pastures wilt;
AMO.1.2	the summit of Carmel
AMO.1.3	 This is what the 
AMO.1.3	“Because Damascus has committed three crimes
AMO.1.3	make that four!
AMO.1.3	decree of judgment.
AMO.1.3	They ripped through Gilead like threshing sledges with iron teeth.
AMO.1.4	 So I will set Hazael’s house
AMO.1.4	fire
AMO.1.5	 I will break the bar
AMO.1.5	I will remove
AMO.1.5	the one who holds the royal scepter from Beth Eden.
AMO.1.5	The people of Aram will be deported to Kir.”
AMO.1.5	The 
AMO.1.6	 This is what the 
AMO.1.6	“Because Gaza
AMO.1.6	make that four!
AMO.1.6	They deported a whole community
AMO.1.7	 So I will set Gaza’s city wall
AMO.1.7	fire
AMO.1.8	 I will remove
AMO.1.8	the one who holds the royal scepter from Ashkelon.
AMO.1.8	I will strike Ekron
AMO.1.8	the rest of the Philistines will also die.”
AMO.1.8	The sovereign 
AMO.1.9	 This is what the 
AMO.1.9	“Because Tyre has committed three crimes
AMO.1.9	make that four!
AMO.1.9	They sold
AMO.1.9	they failed to observe
AMO.1.10	 So I will set fire to Tyre’s city wall;
AMO.1.10	 fire
AMO.1.11	 This is what the 
AMO.1.11	“Because Edom has committed three crimes
AMO.1.11	make that four!
AMO.1.11	He chased his brother
AMO.1.11	he wiped out his allies.
AMO.1.11	In his anger he tore them apart without stopping to rest;
AMO.1.11	in his fury he relentlessly attacked them.
AMO.1.12	 So I will set Teman
AMO.1.12	fire
AMO.1.13	 This is what the 
AMO.1.13	“Because the Ammonites have committed three crimes
AMO.1.13	make that four!
AMO.1.13	They ripped open Gilead’s pregnant women
AMO.1.13	so they could expand their territory.
AMO.1.14	 So I will set fire to Rabbah’s
AMO.1.14	fire
AMO.1.14	War cries will be heard on the day of battle;
AMO.1.14	a strong gale will blow on the day of the windstorm.
AMO.1.15	 Ammon’s

AMO.1.15	The 
AMO.2.1	 This is what the 
AMO.2.1	“Because Moab has committed three crimes
AMO.2.1	make that four!
AMO.2.1	They burned the bones of Edom’s king into lime.
AMO.2.2	 So I will set Moab on fire,
AMO.2.2	and it will consume Kerioth’s
AMO.2.2	Moab will perish
AMO.2.2	amid war cries and the blaring
AMO.2.3	 I will remove
AMO.2.3	I will kill all Moab’s

AMO.2.4	They rejected the 
AMO.2.4	they did not obey his commands.
AMO.2.4	Their false gods,
AMO.2.4	to which their fathers were loyal,
AMO.2.4	led them astray.
AMO.2.5	 So I will set Judah on fire,
AMO.2.5	and it will consume Jerusalem’s fortresses.”
AMO.2.6	 This is what the 
AMO.2.6	“Because Israel has committed three covenant transgressions
AMO.2.6	make that four!
AMO.2.6	They sold the innocent
AMO.2.6	the needy for a pair of sandals.
AMO.2.7	 They trample
AMO.2.7	they push the destitute away.
AMO.2.7	A man and his father go to the same girl;
AMO.2.7	in this way they show disrespect
AMO.2.8	 They stretch out on clothing seized as collateral; 
AMO.2.8	they do so right
AMO.2.8	They drink wine bought with the fines they have levied;
AMO.2.8	they do so right in the temple
AMO.2.9	 For Israel’s sake I destroyed the Amorites.
AMO.2.9	They were as tall as cedars
AMO.2.9	and as strong as oaks,
AMO.2.9	but I destroyed the fruit on their branches
AMO.2.9	and their roots in the ground.
AMO.2.10	 I brought you up from the land of Egypt;
AMO.2.10	I led you through the wilderness for forty years
AMO.2.10	so you could take the Amorites’ land as your own.
AMO.2.11	 I made some of your sons prophets
AMO.2.11	and some of your young men Nazirites.
AMO.2.11	Is this not true, you Israelites?”
AMO.2.11	The 
AMO.2.12	 “But you made the Nazirites drink wine;
AMO.2.12	you commanded the prophets, ‘Do not prophesy!’
AMO.2.13	 Look! I will press you down,
AMO.2.13	like a cart loaded down with grain presses down.
AMO.2.14	 Fast runners will find no place to hide;
AMO.2.14	strong men will have no strength left;
AMO.2.14	warriors will not be able to save their lives.
AMO.2.15	 Archers
AMO.2.15	fast runners will not save their lives,
AMO.2.15	nor will those who ride horses.
AMO.2.16	 Bravehearted
AMO.2.16	The 
AMO.3.1	 Listen, you Israelites, to this message which the 
AMO.3.2	 “I have chosen
AMO.3.3	 Do two walk together without having met?
AMO.3.4	 Does a lion roar in the woods if he has not cornered his prey?
AMO.3.4	Does a young lion bellow from his den if he has not caught something?
AMO.3.5	 Does a bird swoop down into a trap on the ground if there is no bait?
AMO.3.5	Does a trap spring up from the ground unless it has surely caught something?
AMO.3.6	 If an alarm sounds
AMO.3.6	If disaster overtakes a

AMO.3.8	 A lion has roared!
AMO.3.8	The sovereign 
AMO.3.9	 Make this announcement in
AMO.3.9	and in the fortresses in the land of Egypt.
AMO.3.9	Say this:
AMO.3.9	“Gather on the hills around Samaria!
AMO.3.9	Observe the many acts of violence
AMO.3.9	the oppressive deeds
AMO.3.10	 “They do not know how to do what is right.” (The 
AMO.3.10	“They store up
AMO.3.11	 Therefore,” says the sovereign 
AMO.3.11	He will take away your power;
AMO.3.11	your fortresses will be looted.”
AMO.3.12	 This is what the 
AMO.3.12	“Just as a shepherd salvages from the lion’s mouth a couple of leg bones or a piece of an ear,
AMO.3.12	so the Israelites who live in Samaria will be salvaged.
AMO.3.12	They will be left with just a corner of a bed,
AMO.3.12	and a part
AMO.3.13	 Listen and warn
AMO.3.13	The sovereign 
AMO.3.14	 “Certainly when
AMO.3.14	I will destroy
AMO.3.14	The horns
AMO.3.15	 I will destroy both the winter and summer houses.
AMO.3.15	The houses filled with ivory

AMO.3.15	The 
AMO.4.1	 Listen to this message, you cows of Bashan
AMO.4.1	You
AMO.4.1	you crush the needy.
AMO.4.1	You say to your

AMO.4.2	 The sovereign 
AMO.4.2	“Certainly the time is approaching
AMO.4.2	when you will be carried away
AMO.4.2	every last one of you
AMO.4.3	 Each of you will go straight through the gaps in the walls;

AMO.4.5	Make a public display of your voluntary offerings!
AMO.4.5	For you love to do this, you Israelites.”
AMO.4.5	The sovereign 
AMO.4.6	 “But surely I gave
AMO.4.6	you lacked food everywhere you live.
AMO.4.6	Still you did not come back to me.”
AMO.4.6	The 
AMO.4.7	 “I withheld rain from you three months before the harvest.
AMO.4.7	I gave rain to one city, but not to another. 
AMO.4.7	One field

AMO.4.8	Still you did not come back to me.” 
AMO.4.8	The 
AMO.4.9	 “I destroyed your crops
AMO.4.9	Locusts kept
AMO.4.9	Still you did not come back to me.” 
AMO.4.9	The 
AMO.4.10	 “I sent against you a plague like one of the Egyptian plagues.
AMO.4.10	I killed your young men with the sword, 
AMO.4.10	along with the horses you had captured. 
AMO.4.10	I made the stench from the corpses
AMO.4.10	Still you did not come back to me.” 
AMO.4.10	The 
AMO.4.11	 “I overthrew some of you the way God
AMO.4.11	You were like a burning stick

AMO.4.11	The 
AMO.4.12	 “Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel. 
AMO.4.12	Because I will do this to you, 
AMO.4.12	prepare to meet your God, Israel!
AMO.4.13	 For here he is! 
AMO.4.13	He
AMO.4.13	He reveals
AMO.4.13	He turns the dawn into darkness
AMO.4.13	and marches on the heights of the earth. 
AMO.4.13	The 
AMO.5.1	 Listen to this funeral song I am ready to sing about you,
AMO.5.2	 “The virgin
AMO.5.2	She is abandoned on her own land 
AMO.5.2	with no one to help her get up.”
AMO.5.3	 The sovereign 
AMO.5.3	“The city that marches out with a thousand soldiers
AMO.5.3	the town
AMO.5.4	 The 
AMO.5.4	“Seek me
AMO.5.5	 Do not seek Bethel!
AMO.5.5	Do not visit Gilgal!

AMO.5.5	For the people of Gilgal

AMO.5.6	 Seek the 
AMO.5.6	Otherwise he will break out
AMO.5.6	the fire
AMO.5.6	and no one will be able to quench it and save Bethel.
AMO.5.7	 The Israelites
AMO.5.7	they throw what is fair and right
AMO.5.8	 (But there is one who made the constellations Pleiades and Orion;
AMO.5.8	he can turn the darkness into morning
AMO.5.8	and daylight
AMO.5.8	He summons the water of the seas
AMO.5.8	and pours it out on the earth’s surface.
AMO.5.8	The 
AMO.5.9	 He flashes
AMO.5.9	so that destruction overwhelms
AMO.5.10	 The Israelites
AMO.5.10	they despise anyone who speaks honestly.
AMO.5.11	 Therefore, because you make the poor pay taxes on their crops
AMO.5.11	and exact a grain tax from them,
AMO.5.11	you will not live in the houses you built with chiseled stone,
AMO.5.11	nor will you drink the wine from the fine

AMO.5.18	 Woe
AMO.5.18	Why do you want the 
AMO.5.18	It will bring darkness, not light.
AMO.5.19	 Disaster will be inescapable,
AMO.5.19	as if a man ran from a lion only to meet a bear, 
AMO.5.19	then escaped
AMO.5.19	leaned his hand against the wall, 
AMO.5.19	and was bitten by a poisonous snake.
AMO.5.20	 Don’t you realize the 
AMO.5.20	gloomy blackness, not bright light? 
AMO.5.21	 “I absolutely despise

AMO.5.27	He is called the God who commands armies!
AMO.6.1	 Woe
AMO.6.1	to those who feel secure on Mount Samaria.
AMO.6.1	They think of themselves as
AMO.6.1	The family

AMO.6.2	“Journey over to Calneh and look at it!
AMO.6.2	Then go from there to Hamath-Rabbah!
AMO.6.2	Then go down to Gath of the Philistines!
AMO.6.2	Are they superior to our two
AMO.6.2	Is their territory larger than yours?”
AMO.6.3	 You refuse to believe a day of disaster will come,
AMO.6.3	but you establish a reign of violence.
AMO.6.4	 They lie around on beds decorated with ivory,
AMO.6.4	and sprawl out on their couches.
AMO.6.4	They eat lambs from the flock,
AMO.6.4	and calves from the middle of the pen.
AMO.6.5	 They sing
AMO.6.5	like David they invent
AMO.6.6	 They drink wine from sacrificial bowls,
AMO.6.6	and pour the very best oils on themselves.
AMO.6.6	Yet they are not concerned over
AMO.6.7	 Therefore they will now be the first to go into exile,
AMO.6.7	and the religious banquets

AMO.6.8	The 
AMO.6.8	“I despise Jacob’s arrogance;

AMO.6.11	and the small house into little pieces.
AMO.6.12	 Can horses run on rocky cliffs?
AMO.6.12	Can one plow the sea with oxen?
AMO.6.12	Yet you have turned justice into a poisonous plant,
AMO.6.12	and the fruit of righteous actions into a bitter plant.
AMO.6.13	 You are happy because you conquered Lo-Debar.
AMO.6.13	You say, “Did we not conquer Karnaim

AMO.7.8	I will no longer overlook their sin.
AMO.7.9	 Isaac’s centers of worship

AMO.7.9	I will attack Jeroboam’s dynasty with the sword.”
AMO.7.10	 Amaziah the priest of Bethel
AMO.7.11	 As a matter of fact,
AMO.7.12	 Amaziah then said to Amos, “Leave, you visionary!
AMO.7.13	 Don’t prophesy at Bethel

AMO.7.15	 Then the 
AMO.7.16	 So now listen to the 
AMO.7.17	 “Therefore this is what the

AMO.8.9	and make the earth dark in the middle of the day.
AMO.8.10	 I will turn your festivals into funerals,
AMO.8.10	and all your songs into funeral dirges.
AMO.8.10	I will make everyone wear funeral clothes
AMO.8.10	and cause every head to be shaved bald.
AMO.8.10	I will make you mourn as if you had lost your only son;
AMO.8.10	when it ends it will indeed have been a bitter day.

MIC.1.4	 The mountains will disintegrate

MIC.1.4	The mountains will melt
MIC.1.4	the rocks will slide down like water cascading down a steep slope.
MIC.1.5	 All this is because of Jacob’s rebellion
MIC.1.5	and
MIC.1.5	How has Jacob rebelled, you ask?
MIC.1.5	Samaria epitomizes their rebellion!
MIC.1.5	Where are Judah’s pagan worship centers, you ask?
MIC.1.5	They are right in Jerusalem!
MIC.1.6	 “I will turn Samaria

MIC.1.7	all her metal cult statues will be destroyed by fire.
MIC.1.7	I will make a waste heap
MIC.1.7	Since

MIC.1.8	 For this reason I

MIC.1.12	 Indeed, the residents of Maroth
MIC.1.12	though the 
MIC.1.13	 Residents of Lachish,
MIC.1.13	You
MIC.1.13	for Israel’s rebellious deeds can be traced back
MIC.1.14	 Therefore you
MIC.1.14	The residents
MIC.1.14	as a dried up well
MIC.1.15	 Residents of Mareshah,
MIC.1.15	the leaders of Israel shall flee to Adullam.
MIC.1.16	 Shave your heads bald as you mourn for the children you love;
MIC.1.16	shave your foreheads as bald

MIC.2.1	 Those who devise sinful plans are as good as dead,
MIC.2.1	those who dream about doing evil as they lie in bed.
MIC.2.1	As soon as morning dawns they carry out their plans,
MIC.2.1	because they have the power to do so.
MIC.2.2	 They confiscate the fields they desire,
MIC.2.2	and seize the houses they want.
MIC.2.2	They defraud people of their homes,
MIC.2.2	and deprive people of the land they have inherited.
MIC.2.3	 Therefore the 
MIC.2.3	It will be like a yoke from which you cannot free your neck.
MIC.2.3	You will no longer
MIC.2.3	for it will be a time of catastrophe.
MIC.2.4	 In that day people will sing this taunt song to you – 
MIC.2.4	they will mock you with this lament:
MIC.2.4	‘We are completely destroyed;
MIC.2.4	they sell off
MIC.2.4	How they remove it from me!
MIC.2.4	They assign our fields to the conqueror.’
MIC.2.5	 Therefore no one will assign you land in the 
MIC.2.6	 ‘Don’t preach with such impassioned rhetoric,’ they say excitedly.
MIC.2.6	‘These prophets should not preach of such things;
MIC.2.6	we will not be overtaken by humiliation.’
MIC.2.7	 Does the family
MIC.2.7	‘The 
MIC.2.7	he would never do such things’?
MIC.2.7	To be sure, my commands bring a reward
MIC.2.7	for those who obey them,
MIC.2.8	 but you rise up as an enemy against my people.
MIC.2.8	You steal a robe from a friend,
MIC.2.8	from those who pass by peacefully as if returning from a war.
MIC.2.9	 You wrongly evict widows
MIC.2.9	You defraud their children
MIC.2.10	 But you are the ones who will be forced to leave!
MIC.2.10	For this land is not secure!
MIC.2.10	Sin will thoroughly destroy it!
MIC.2.11	 If a lying windbag should come and say,
MIC.2.11	‘I’ll promise you blessings of wine and beer,’
MIC.2.11	he would be just the right preacher for these people!
MIC.2.12	 I will certainly gather all of you, O Jacob,
MIC.2.12	I will certainly assemble those Israelites who remain.
MIC.2.12	I will bring them together like sheep in a fold,
MIC.2.12	like a flock in the middle of a pasture;
MIC.2.12	they will be so numerous that they will make a lot of noise.
MIC.2.13	 The one who can break through barriers will lead them out
MIC.2.13	they will break out, pass through the gate, and leave.
MIC.2.13	Their king will advance
MIC.2.13	The 
MIC.3.1	 I said,
MIC.3.1	“Listen, you leaders
MIC.3.1	you rulers of the nation
MIC.3.1	You ought to know what is just,
MIC.3.2	 yet you
MIC.3.2	and love what is evil.
MIC.3.2	You flay my people’s skin
MIC.3.2	and rip the flesh from their bones.
MIC.3.3	 You
MIC.3.3	strip off their skin,
MIC.3.3	and crush their bones.
MIC.3.3	You chop them up like flesh in a pot
MIC.3.3	like meat in a kettle.
MIC.3.4	 Someday these sinners will cry to the 
MIC.3.4	but he will not answer them.
MIC.3.4	He will hide his face from them at that time,
MIC.3.4	because they have done such wicked deeds.”
MIC.3.5	 This is what the 
MIC.3.5	are as good as dead.
MIC.3.5	If someone gives them enough to eat,
MIC.3.5	they offer an oracle of peace.
MIC.3.5	But if someone does not give them food,
MIC.3.5	they are ready to declare war on him.
MIC.3.6	 Therefore night will fall, and you will receive no visions;
MIC.3.6	it will grow dark, and you will no longer be able to read the omens.
MIC.3.6	The sun will set on these prophets,
MIC.3.6	and the daylight will turn to darkness over their heads.
MIC.3.7	 The prophets
MIC.3.7	the omen readers will be humiliated.
MIC.3.7	All of them will cover their mouths,
MIC.3.7	for they will receive no divine oracles.”
MIC.3.8	 But I
MIC.3.8	and have a strong commitment to justice.
MIC.3.8	This enables me to confront Jacob with its rebellion,
MIC.3.8	and Israel with its sin.
MIC.3.9	 Listen to this, you leaders of the family
MIC.3.9	you rulers of the nation
MIC.3.9	You
MIC.3.9	and pervert all that is right.
MIC.3.10	 You
MIC.3.10	Jerusalem
MIC.3.11	 Her
MIC.3.11	her priests proclaim rulings for profit,
MIC.3.11	and her prophets read omens for pay.
MIC.3.11	Yet they claim to trust
MIC.3.11	“The 
MIC.3.11	Disaster will not overtake
MIC.3.12	 Therefore, because of you,
MIC.3.12	Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins,
MIC.3.12	and the Temple Mount
MIC.4.1	 In the future
MIC.4.1	it will be more prominent than other hills.
MIC.4.1	People will stream to it.
MIC.4.2	 Many nations will come, saying,
MIC.4.2	“Come on! Let’s go up to the 
MIC.4.2	to the temple
MIC.4.2	so he can teach us his commands
MIC.4.2	and we can live by his laws.”
MIC.4.2	For Zion will be the source of instruction;
MIC.4.2	the 
MIC.4.3	 He will arbitrate
MIC.4.3	and settle disputes between many
MIC.4.3	They will beat their swords into plowshares,
MIC.4.3	and their spears into pruning hooks.
MIC.4.3	Nations will not use weapons
MIC.4.3	and they will no longer train for war.
MIC.4.4	 Each will sit under his own grapevine
MIC.4.4	or under his own fig tree without any fear.
MIC.4.4	The 
MIC.4.5	 Though all the nations follow their respective gods,
MIC.4.5	we will follow
MIC.4.6	 “In that day,” says the 
MIC.4.6	and assemble the outcasts whom I injured.
MIC.4.7	 I will transform the lame into the nucleus of a new nation,
MIC.4.7	and those far off
MIC.4.7	The 
MIC.4.7	from that day forward and forevermore.”
MIC.4.8	 As for you, watchtower for the flock,
MIC.4.8	fortress of Daughter Zion
MIC.4.8	your former dominion will be restored,
MIC.4.8	the sovereignty that belongs to Daughter Jerusalem.
MIC.4.9	 Jerusalem, why are you
MIC.4.9	Has your king disappeared?
MIC.4.9	Has your wise leader
MIC.4.9	Is this why
MIC.4.10	 Twist and strain,
MIC.4.10	For you will leave the city
MIC.4.10	and live in the open field.
MIC.4.10	You will go to Babylon,
MIC.4.10	but there you will be rescued.
MIC.4.10	There the 
MIC.4.10	from the power
MIC.4.11	 Many nations have now assembled against you.
MIC.4.11	They say, “Jerusalem must be desecrated,
MIC.4.11	so we can gloat over Zion!”
MIC.4.12	 But they do not know what the 
MIC.4.12	they do not understand his strategy.
MIC.4.12	He has gathered them like stalks of grain to be threshed
MIC.4.13	 “Get up and thresh, Daughter Zion!
MIC.4.13	For I will give you iron horns;
MIC.4.13	I will give you bronze hooves,
MIC.4.13	and you will crush many nations.”
MIC.4.13	You will devote to the 
MIC.4.13	and dedicate their wealth to the sovereign Ruler
MIC.5.1	We are besieged!
MIC.5.1	With a scepter
MIC.5.1	on the side of his face.
MIC.5.2	seemingly insignificant
MIC.5.2	from you a king will emerge who will rule over Israel on my behalf,

MIC.5.7	 Those survivors from

MIC.5.7	They will be like the dew the 
MIC.5.7	like the rain on the grass,
MIC.5.7	that does not hope for men to come
MIC.5.7	or wait around for humans to arrive.
MIC.5.8	 Those survivors from Jacob will live among the nations,
MIC.5.8	in the midst of many peoples.
MIC.5.8	They will be like a lion among the animals of the forest,
MIC.5.8	like a young lion among the flocks of sheep,
MIC.5.8	which attacks when it passes through;
MIC.5.8	it rips its prey
MIC.5.9	 Lift your hand triumphantly against your adversaries;
MIC.5.9	may all your enemies be destroyed!
MIC.5.10	 “In that day,” says the 
MIC.5.10	“I will destroy
MIC.5.10	and smash your chariots.
MIC.5.11	 I will destroy the cities of your land,
MIC.5.11	and tear down all your fortresses.
MIC.5.12	 I will remove the sorcery
MIC.5.12	and you will no longer have omen readers living among you.
MIC.5.13	 I will remove your idols and sacred pillars from your midst;
MIC.5.13	you will no longer worship what your own hands made.
MIC.5.14	 I will uproot your images of Asherah
MIC.5.14	and destroy your idols.
MIC.5.15	 I will angrily seek vengeance
MIC.5.15	on the nations that do not obey me.”
MIC.6.1	 Listen to what the 
MIC.6.1	“Get up! Defend yourself
MIC.6.1	Present your case before the hills!”
MIC.6.2	 Hear the 
MIC.6.2	you enduring foundations of the earth!
MIC.6.2	For the

MIC.6.3	 “My people, how have I wronged you?
MIC.6.3	How have I wearied you? Answer me!
MIC.6.4	 In fact, I brought you up from the land of Egypt,
MIC.6.4	I delivered you from that place of slavery.
MIC.6.4	I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.
MIC.6.5	 My people, recall how King Balak of Moab planned to harm you,
MIC.6.5	how Balaam son of Beor responded to him.
MIC.6.5	Recall how you journeyed from Shittim to Gilgal,
MIC.6.5	so you might acknowledge that the

MIC.6.6	with year-old calves?
MIC.6.7	 Will the 
MIC.6.7	or ten thousand streams of olive oil?
MIC.6.7	Should I give him my firstborn child as payment for my rebellion,
MIC.6.7	my offspring – my own flesh and blood – for my sin?
MIC.6.8	 He has told you, O man, what is good,
MIC.6.8	and what the 
MIC.6.8	He wants you to
MIC.6.8	and to live obediently before
MIC.6.9	 Listen! The 
MIC.6.9	It is wise to respect your authority, O 
MIC.6.9	Listen, O nation, and those assembled in the city!
MIC.6.10	 “I will not overlook,
MIC.6.10	or the smaller-than-standard measure I hate so much.
MIC.6.11	 I do not condone the use of rigged scales,
MIC.6.11	or a bag of deceptive weights.
MIC.6.12	 The city’s rich men think nothing of resorting to violence;
MIC.6.12	her inhabitants lie,
MIC.6.12	their tongues speak deceptive words.
MIC.6.13	 I will strike you brutally
MIC.6.13	and destroy you because of your sin.
MIC.6.14	 You will eat, but not be satisfied.
MIC.6.14	Even if you have the strength
MIC.6.14	you will not be able to carry it away;
MIC.6.14	if you do happen to carry away something, 
MIC.6.14	I will deliver it over to the sword.
MIC.6.15	 You will plant crops, but will not harvest them;
MIC.6.15	you will squeeze oil from the olives,
MIC.6.15	you will squeeze juice from the grapes, but you will have no wine to drink.
MIC.6.16	 You implement the regulations of Omri, 
MIC.6.16	and all the practices of Ahab’s dynasty;
MIC.6.16	you follow their policies.
MIC.6.16	Therefore I will make you an appalling sight,
MIC.6.16	the city’s
MIC.6.16	and nations will mock all of you.”
MIC.7.1	 I am depressed!
MIC.7.1	Indeed,
MIC.7.1	and the grapes have been harvested.
MIC.7.1	There is no grape cluster to eat,
MIC.7.1	no fresh figs that I crave so much.
MIC.7.2	 Faithful men have disappeared
MIC.7.2	there are no godly men left.
MIC.7.2	They all wait in ambush so they can shed blood;
MIC.7.2	they hunt their own brother with a net.
MIC.7.3	 They are determined to be experts at doing evil;
MIC.7.3	government officials and judges take bribes,
MIC.7.3	prominent men make demands, 
MIC.7.3	and they all do what is necessary to satisfy them.
MIC.7.4	 The best of them is like a thorn;
MIC.7.4	the most godly among them are more dangerous than a row of thorn bushes.
MIC.7.4	The day you try to avoid by posting watchmen – 
MIC.7.4	your appointed time of punishment – is on the way,
MIC.7.4	and then you will experience confusion.
MIC.7.5	 Do not rely on a friend;
MIC.7.5	do not trust a companion!
MIC.7.5	Don’t even share secrets with the one who lies in your arms!
MIC.7.6	 For a son thinks his father is a fool,
MIC.7.6	a daughter challenges
MIC.7.6	and a daughter-in-law her mother-in-law;
MIC.7.6	a man’s enemies are his own servants.

HAB.1.2	I call out to you, “Violence!”

HAB.1.3	 Why do you force me to witness injustice?
HAB.1.3	Why do you put up with wrongdoing?
HAB.1.3	Destruction and violence confront
HAB.1.3	conflict is present and one must endure strife.
HAB.1.4	 For this reason the law lacks power,

HAB.1.4	Indeed,

HAB.1.10	They laugh at every fortified city;

HAB.1.11	 They sweep by like the wind and pass on.

HAB.1.13	So why do you put up with such treacherous people?
HAB.1.13	Why do you say nothing when the wicked devour

HAB.2.10	 Your schemes will bring shame to your house.
HAB.2.10	Because you destroyed many nations, you will self-destruct.

HAB.2.11	and the wooden rafters will answer back.
HAB.2.12	 The one who builds a city by bloodshed is as good as dead
HAB.2.12	he who starts
HAB.2.13	 Be sure of this! The 
HAB.2.13	The nations’ efforts will go up in smoke; 
HAB.2.13	their exhausting work will be for nothing.
HAB.2.14	 For recognition of the 
HAB.2.14	just as the waters fill up the sea.
HAB.2.15	 “You who force your neighbor to drink wine
HAB.2.15	you who make others intoxicated by forcing them to drink from the bowl of your furious anger,
HAB.2.15	so you can look at their genitals.

HAB.2.16	The cup of wine in the 
HAB.2.16	and disgrace will replace your majestic glory!
HAB.2.17	 For you will pay in full for your violent acts against Lebanon;
HAB.2.17	terrifying judgment will come upon you because of the way you destroyed the wild animals living there.
HAB.2.17	You have shed human blood
HAB.2.17	and committed violent acts against lands, cities, and those who live in them.
HAB.2.18	 What good
HAB.2.18	What good is a metal image that gives misleading oracles?
HAB.2.18	Why would its creator place his trust in it

HAB.2.20	 But the 
HAB.2.20	The whole earth is speechless in his presence!”
HAB.3.1	 This is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet:
HAB.3.2	I am awed,
HAB.3.2	In our time
HAB.3.2	in our time reveal them again.
HAB.3.2	But when you cause turmoil, remember to show us mercy!
HAB.3.3	 God comes
HAB.3.3	the sovereign
HAB.3.3	His splendor covers the skies,
HAB.3.3	his glory
HAB.3.4	 He is as bright as lightning;
HAB.3.4	a two-pronged lightning bolt flashes from his hand.
HAB.3.4	This is the outward display of his power.
HAB.3.5	 Plague goes before him;
HAB.3.5	pestilence
HAB.3.6	 He takes his battle position
HAB.3.6	with a mere look he frightens
HAB.3.6	The ancient mountains disintegrate;
HAB.3.6	the primeval hills are flattened.
HAB.3.6	He travels on the ancient roads.
HAB.3.7	 I see the tents of Cushan overwhelmed by trouble;
HAB.3.7	the tent curtains of the land of Midian are shaking.
HAB.3.8	 Is the 
HAB.3.8	Are you angry with the rivers?
HAB.3.8	Are you enraged at the sea?
HAB.3.8	Is this why
HAB.3.8	your victorious chariots?
HAB.3.9	 Your bow is ready for action;
HAB.3.9	you commission your arrows.
HAB.3.9	You cause flash floods on the earth’s surface.
HAB.3.10	 When the mountains see you, they shake.
HAB.3.10	The torrential downpour sweeps through.
HAB.3.10	The great deep
HAB.3.10	it lifts its hands high.
HAB.3.11	 The sun and moon stand still in their courses;
HAB.3.11	the flash of your arrows drives them away,
HAB.3.11	the bright light of your lightning-quick spear.
HAB.3.12	 You furiously stomp on the earth,
HAB.3.12	you angrily trample down the nations.
HAB.3.13	 You march out to deliver your people,
HAB.3.13	to deliver your special servant.
HAB.3.13	You strike the leader of the wicked nation,
HAB.3.13	laying him open from the lower body to the neck.
HAB.3.14	 You pierce the heads of his warriors
HAB.3.14	They storm forward to scatter us;
HAB.3.14	they shout with joy as if they were plundering the poor with no opposition.
HAB.3.15	 But you trample on the sea with your horses,
HAB.3.15	on the surging, raging waters.
HAB.3.16	 I listened and my stomach churned;
HAB.3.16	the sound made my lips quiver.
HAB.3.16	My frame went limp, as if my bones were decaying,
HAB.3.16	and I shook as I tried to walk.
HAB.3.16	I long
HAB.3.16	to come upon

HAG.1.4	 “Is it right for you to live in richly paneled houses
HAG.1.5	 Here then is what the 
HAG.1.6	 You have planted much, but have harvested little. You eat, but are never filled. You drink, but are still thirsty. You put on clothes, but are not warm. Those who earn wages end up with holes in their money bags.’”
HAG.1.7	 “Moreover, the

HAG.1.12	 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak,
HAG.1.13	 Then Haggai, the 
HAG.1.14	 So the 
HAG.1.15	 This took place on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month of King Darius’ second year.
HAG.2.1	 On the twenty-first day of the seventh month,
HAG.2.2	 “Ask the following questions to
HAG.2.3	 ‘Who among you survivors saw the former splendor of this temple?
HAG.2.4	 Even so, take heart, Zerubbabel,’ says the

HAG.2.11	 “The 
HAG.2.12	 If someone carries holy meat in a fold of his garment and that fold touches bread, a boiled dish, wine, olive oil, or any other food, will that item become holy?’”
HAG.2.13	 Then Haggai asked, “If a person who is ritually unclean because of touching a dead body
HAG.2.14	 Then Haggai responded, “‘The people of this nation are unclean in my sight,’
HAG.2.15	 Now therefore reflect carefully on the recent past,
HAG.2.16	 From that time
HAG.2.17	 I struck all the products of your labor
HAG.2.18	 ‘Think carefully about the past:
HAG.2.19	 The seed is still in the storehouse, isn’t it? And the vine, fig tree, pomegranate, and olive tree have not produced. Nevertheless, from today on I will bless you.’”
HAG.2.20	 Then the 
HAG.2.21	 Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah: ‘I am ready
HAG.2.22	 I will overthrow royal thrones and shatter the might of earthly kingdoms.
HAG.2.23	 On that day,’
ZEC.1.1	 In the eighth month of Darius’

ZEC.1.3	 Therefore say to the people:
ZEC.1.4	 “Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the former prophets called out, saying, ‘The 
ZEC.1.5	 “As for your ancestors, where are they? And did the prophets live forever? 
ZEC.1.6	 But have my words and statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, not outlived your fathers?
ZEC.1.7	 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month 
ZEC.1.8	 I was attentive that night and saw a man seated
ZEC.1.9	 Then I asked one nearby, “What are these, sir?” The angelic messenger
ZEC.1.10	 Then the man standing among the myrtle trees spoke up and said, “These are the ones whom the 
ZEC.1.11	 The riders then agreed with the angel of the 
ZEC.1.12	 The angel of the 
ZEC.1.13	 The 
ZEC.1.14	 Turning to me, the messenger then said, “Cry out that the 
ZEC.1.15	 But I am greatly displeased with the nations that take my grace for granted.
ZEC.1.16	 “‘Therefore,’ says the 
ZEC.1.17	 Speak up again with the message of the 
ZEC.1.18	 (2:1)
ZEC.1.19	 So I asked the angelic messenger
ZEC.1.20	 Next the 
ZEC.1.21	 I asked, “What are these going to do?” He answered, “These horns are the ones that have scattered Judah so that there is no one to be seen.
ZEC.2.1	 (2:5) I looked again, and there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
ZEC.2.2	 I asked, “Where are you going?” He replied, “To measure Jerusalem

ZEC.2.4	 and said to him, “Hurry, speak to this young man
ZEC.2.5	 But I (the 
ZEC.2.6	 “You there!

ZEC.3.2	 The 
ZEC.3.3	 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes
ZEC.3.4	 The angel
ZEC.3.5	 Then I spoke up, “Let a clean turban be put on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the 
ZEC.3.6	 Then the angel of the 
ZEC.3.7	 “The 
ZEC.3.8	 Listen now, Joshua the high priest, both you and your colleagues who are sitting before you, all of you
ZEC.3.9	 As for the stone
ZEC.3.10	 In that day,’ says the 
ZEC.4.1	 The angelic messenger
ZEC.4.2	 He asked me, “What do you see?” I replied,
ZEC.4.3	 There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the receptacle and the other on the left.”
ZEC.4.4	 Then I asked the messenger who spoke with me, “What are these,
ZEC.4.5	 He replied, “Don’t you know what these are?” So I responded, “No, sir.” 
ZEC.4.6	 Therefore he told me, “These signify the word of the 
ZEC.4.7	 “What are you, you great mountain?
ZEC.4.8	 Moreover, the word of the 
ZEC.4.9	 “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations of this temple,
ZEC.4.10	 For who dares make light of small beginnings? These seven eyes
ZEC.4.11	 Next I asked the messenger, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the menorah?” 
ZEC.4.12	 Before he could reply I asked again, “What are these two extensions
ZEC.4.13	 He replied, “Don’t you know what these are?” And I said, “No, sir.” 
ZEC.4.14	 So he said, “These are the two anointed ones
ZEC.5.1	 Then I turned to look, and there was a flying scroll! 
ZEC.5.2	 Someone asked me, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a flying scroll thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide.”
ZEC.5.3	 The speaker went on to say, “This is a curse
ZEC.5.4	 “I will send it out,” says the 
ZEC.5.5	 After this the angelic messenger
ZEC.5.6	 I asked, “What is it?” And he replied, “It is a basket for measuring grain
ZEC.5.7	 Then a round lead cover was raised up, revealing a woman sitting inside the basket. 
ZEC.5.8	 He then said, “This woman represents wickedness,” and he pushed her down into the basket and placed the lead cover on top. 
ZEC.5.9	 Then I looked again and saw two women
ZEC.5.10	 I asked the messenger who was speaking to me, “Where are they taking the basket?” 
ZEC.5.11	 He replied, “To build a temple
ZEC.6.1	 Once more I looked, and this time I saw four chariots emerging from between two mountains of bronze.
ZEC.6.2	 Harnessed to the first chariot were red horses, to the second black horses, 
ZEC.6.3	 to the third white horses, and to the fourth spotted horses, all of them strong.
ZEC.6.4	 Then I asked the angelic messenger
ZEC.6.5	 The messenger replied, “These are the four spirits
ZEC.6.6	 The chariot with the black horses is going to the north country and the white ones are going after them, but the spotted ones are going to the south country. 
ZEC.6.7	 All these strong ones

ZEC.6.10	 “Choose some people

ZEC.7.7	 Should you not have obeyed the words that the

ZEC.7.11	 “But they refused to pay attention, turning away stubbornly and stopping their ears so they could not hear. 
ZEC.7.12	 Indeed, they made their heart as hard as diamond,

ZEC.8.2	 “The 
ZEC.8.3	 The Lord says, ‘I have returned to Zion and will live within Jerusalem.
ZEC.8.4	 Moreover, the 
ZEC.8.5	 And the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing.
ZEC.8.6	 And,’ says the 
ZEC.8.7	 “The 
ZEC.8.8	 And I will bring them to settle within Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God,

ZEC.8.10	 Before that time there was no compensation for man or animal, nor was there any relief from adversity for those who came and went, because I had pitted everybody – each one – against everyone else. 
ZEC.8.11	 But I will be different now to this remnant of my people from the way I was in those days,’ says the 
ZEC.8.12	 ‘for there will be a peaceful time of sowing, the vine will produce its fruit and the ground its yield, and the skies
ZEC.8.13	 And it will come about that just as you (both Judah and Israel) were a curse to the nations, so I will save you and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid! Instead, be strong!’
ZEC.8.14	 “For the 
ZEC.8.15	 so, to the contrary, I have planned in these days to do good to Jerusalem and Judah – do not fear! 
ZEC.8.16	 These are the things you must do: Speak the truth, each of you, to one another. Practice true and righteous judgment in your courts.
ZEC.8.17	 Do not plan evil in your hearts against one another. Do not favor a false oath – these are all things that I hate,’ says the 
ZEC.8.18	 The word of the 
ZEC.8.19	 “The 
ZEC.8.20	 The 
ZEC.8.21	 The inhabitants of one will go to another and say, “Let’s go up at once to ask the favor of the

ZEC.9.2	 as are those of Hamath also, which adjoins Damascus, and Tyre
ZEC.9.3	 Tyre built herself a fortification and piled up silver like dust and gold like the mud of the streets! 
ZEC.9.4	 Nevertheless the Lord will evict her and shove her fortifications
ZEC.9.5	 Ashkelon will see and be afraid; Gaza will be in great anguish, as will Ekron, for her hope will have been dried up.
ZEC.9.6	 A mongrel people will live in Ashdod, for I will greatly humiliate the Philistines. 
ZEC.9.7	 I will take away their abominable religious practices;
ZEC.9.8	 Then I will surround my temple
ZEC.9.9	 Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!
ZEC.9.9	Shout, daughter of Jerusalem!
ZEC.9.9	Look! Your king is coming to you:
ZEC.9.9	he is legitimate
ZEC.9.9	humble and riding on a donkey
ZEC.9.9	on a young donkey, the foal of a female donkey.
ZEC.9.10	 I will remove
ZEC.9.10	and the warhorse from Jerusalem,
ZEC.9.10	and the battle bow will be removed.
ZEC.9.10	Then he will announce peace to the nations.
ZEC.9.10	His dominion will be from sea to sea
ZEC.9.10	and from the Euphrates River
ZEC.9.11	 Moreover, as for you, because of our covenant relationship secured with blood, I will release your prisoners from the waterless pit. 
ZEC.9.12	 Return to the stronghold, you prisoners, with hope; today I declare that I will return double what was taken from you. 
ZEC.9.13	 I will bend Judah as my bow; I will load the bow with Ephraim, my arrow!
ZEC.9.14	 Then the 
ZEC.9.15	 The 
ZEC.9.16	 On that day the 
ZEC.9.17	 How precious and fair!
ZEC.10.1	 Ask the 
ZEC.10.2	 For the household gods
ZEC.10.3	 I am enraged at the shepherds and will punish the lead-goats.
ZEC.10.3	For the 
ZEC.10.4	 From him will come the cornerstone,
ZEC.10.5	 And they will be like warriors trampling the mud of the streets in battle. They will fight, for the 
ZEC.10.6	 “I (says the 
ZEC.10.7	 The Ephraimites will be like warriors and will rejoice as if they had drunk wine. Their children will see it and rejoice; they will celebrate in the things of the 
ZEC.10.8	 I will signal for them and gather them, for I have already redeemed them; then they will become as numerous as they were before. 
ZEC.10.9	 Though I scatter
ZEC.10.10	 I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria.
ZEC.10.11	 The 
ZEC.10.12	 Thus I will strengthen them by my power,
ZEC.11.1	 Open your gates, Lebanon,
ZEC.11.1	so that the fire may consume your cedars.
ZEC.11.2	 Howl, fir tree,
ZEC.11.2	because the cedar has fallen;
ZEC.11.2	the majestic trees have been destroyed.
ZEC.11.2	Howl, oaks of Bashan,
ZEC.11.2	because the impenetrable forest has fallen.
ZEC.11.3	 Listen to the howling of shepherds,
ZEC.11.3	because their magnificence has been destroyed.
ZEC.11.3	Listen to the roaring of young lions,
ZEC.11.3	because the thickets of the Jordan have been devastated.
ZEC.11.4	 The 
ZEC.11.5	 Those who buy them
ZEC.11.6	 Indeed, I will no longer have compassion on the people of the land,” says the 
ZEC.11.7	 So I
ZEC.11.8	 Next I eradicated the three shepherds in one month,
ZEC.11.9	 I then said, “I will not shepherd you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be eradicated, let it be eradicated. As for those who survive, let them eat each other’s flesh!”
ZEC.11.10	 Then I took my staff “Pleasantness” and cut it in two to annul my covenant that I had made with all the people. 
ZEC.11.11	 So it was annulled that very day, and then the most afflicted of the flock who kept faith with me knew that that was the word of the 
ZEC.11.12	 Then I
ZEC.11.13	 The 
ZEC.11.14	 Then I cut the second staff “Binders” in two in order to annul the covenant of brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
ZEC.11.15	 Again the 
ZEC.11.16	 Indeed, I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not take heed to the sheep headed to slaughter, will not seek the scattered, and will not heal the injured.
ZEC.11.17	 Woe to the worthless shepherd
ZEC.11.17	who abandons the flock!
ZEC.11.17	May a sword fall on his arm and his right eye!
ZEC.11.17	May his arm wither completely away,
ZEC.11.17	and his right eye become completely blind!”
ZEC.12.1	 The revelation of the word of the 
ZEC.12.2	 “I am about to make Jerusalem
ZEC.12.3	 Moreover, on that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy burden
ZEC.12.4	 In that day,” says the 
ZEC.12.5	 Then the leaders of Judah will say to themselves, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are a means of strength to us through their God, the 
ZEC.12.6	 On that day
ZEC.12.7	 The 
ZEC.12.8	 On that day the 
ZEC.12.9	 So on that day I will set out to destroy all the nations
ZEC.12.10	 “I will pour out on the kingship
ZEC.12.11	 On that day the lamentation in Jerusalem will be as great as the lamentation at Hadad-Rimmon
ZEC.12.12	 The land will mourn, clan by clan – the clan of the royal household of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the clan of the family of Nathan
ZEC.12.13	 the clan of the descendants of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; and the clan of the Shimeites
ZEC.12.14	 all the clans that remain, each separately with their wives.”
ZEC.13.1	 “In that day there will be a fountain opened up for the dynasty
ZEC.13.2	 And also on that day,” says the 
ZEC.13.3	 Then, if anyone prophesies in spite of this, his father and mother to whom he was born will say to him, ‘You cannot live, for you lie in the name of the 
ZEC.13.4	 “Therefore, on that day each prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies and will no longer wear the hairy garment
ZEC.13.5	 Instead he will say, ‘I am no prophet – indeed, I am a farmer, for a man has made me his indentured servant since my youth.’
ZEC.13.6	 Then someone will ask him, ‘What are these wounds on your chest?’
ZEC.13.7	 “Awake, sword, against my shepherd,
ZEC.13.7	against the man who is my associate,”
ZEC.13.7	says the 
ZEC.13.7	Strike the shepherd that the flock may be scattered;
ZEC.13.7	I will turn my hand against the insignificant ones.
ZEC.13.8	 It will happen in all the land, says the 
ZEC.13.8	that two-thirds of the people
ZEC.13.8	but one-third will be left in it.
ZEC.13.9	 Then I will bring the remaining third into the fire;
ZEC.13.9	I will refine them like silver is refined
ZEC.13.9	and will test them like gold is tested.
ZEC.13.9	They will call on my name and I will answer;
ZEC.13.9	I will say, ‘These are my people,’
ZEC.13.9	and they will say, ‘The 
ZEC.14.1	 A day of the 
ZEC.14.2	 For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem

ZEC.14.4	 On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which lies to the east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in half from east to west, leaving a great valley. Half the mountain will move northward and the other half southward.
ZEC.14.5	 Then you will escape

ZEC.14.10	 All the land will change and become like the Arabah

ZEC.14.12	 But this will be the nature of the plague with which the 
ZEC.14.13	 On that day there will be great confusion from the 
ZEC.14.14	 Moreover, Judah will fight at
ZEC.14.15	 This is the kind of plague that will devastate horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the other animals in those camps.
ZEC.14.16	 Then all who survive from all the nations that came to attack Jerusalem will go up annually to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.17	 But if any of the nations anywhere on earth refuse to go up to Jerusalem
ZEC.14.18	 If the Egyptians will not do so, they will get no rain – instead there will be the kind of plague which the 
ZEC.14.19	 This will be the punishment of Egypt and of all nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.

MAT.1.2	 Abraham was the father
MAT.1.3	 Judah the father of Perez and Zerah (by Tamar), Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram, 
MAT.1.4	 Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon, 
MAT.1.5	 Salmon the father of Boaz (by Rahab), Boaz the father of Obed (by Ruth), Obed the father of Jesse, 
MAT.1.6	 and Jesse the father of David the king.
MAT.1.6	David was the father of Solomon (by the wife of Uriah
MAT.1.7	 Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,
MAT.1.8	 Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah,

MAT.1.15	 Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob, 
MAT.1.16	 and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom
MAT.1.17	 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to Christ,
MAT.1.18	 Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together,
MAT.1.19	 Because Joseph, her husband to be,
MAT.1.20	 When he had contemplated this, an
MAT.1.21	 She will give birth to a son and you will name him
MAT.1.22	 This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled: 
MAT.1.23	 “
MAT.1.24	 When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord
MAT.1.25	 but did not have marital relations
MAT.2.1	 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem
MAT.2.2	 saying, “Where is the one who is born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose
MAT.2.3	 When King Herod
MAT.2.4	 After assembling all the chief priests and experts in the law,
MAT.2.5	 “In Bethlehem of Judea,” they said, “for it is written this way by the prophet:

MAT.2.6	’”
MAT.2.7	 Then Herod
MAT.2.8	 He
MAT.2.9	 After listening to the king they left, and once again
MAT.2.10	 When they saw the star they shouted joyfully.
MAT.2.11	 As they came into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, they bowed down

MAT.2.18	”
MAT.2.19	 After Herod
MAT.2.20	 saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child’s life are dead.” 
MAT.2.21	 So
MAT.2.22	 But when he heard that Archelaus
MAT.2.23	 He came to a town called Nazareth
MAT.3.1	 In those days John the Baptist came into the wilderness
MAT.3.2	 “Repent,
MAT.3.3	 For he is the one about whom Isaiah the prophet had spoken:
MAT.3.3	“
MAT.3.3	‘
MAT.3.4	 Now John wore clothing made from camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.
MAT.3.5	 Then people from Jerusalem,
MAT.3.6	 and he was baptizing them
MAT.3.7	 But when he saw many Pharisees
MAT.3.8	 Therefore produce fruit
MAT.3.9	 and don’t think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones! 
MAT.3.10	 Even now the ax is laid at

MAT.3.13	 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John to be baptized by him in the Jordan River.
MAT.3.14	 But John
MAT.3.15	 So Jesus replied
MAT.3.16	 After
MAT.3.17	 And
MAT.4.1	 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
MAT.4.2	 After he fasted forty days and forty nights he was famished.
MAT.4.3	 The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.”
MAT.4.4	 But he answered,
MAT.4.5	 Then the devil took him to the holy city,
MAT.4.6	 and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, ‘
MAT.4.7	 Jesus said to him, “Once again it is written: ‘
MAT.4.8	 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their grandeur.
MAT.4.9	 And he said to him, “I will give you all these things if you throw yourself to the ground and worship
MAT.4.10	 Then Jesus said to him, “Go away,
MAT.4.11	 Then the devil left him, and angels
MAT.4.12	 Now when Jesus
MAT.4.13	 While in Galilee, he moved from Nazareth
MAT.4.14	 so that what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled:
MAT.4.15	 “
MAT.4.16	”
MAT.4.17	 From that time Jesus began to preach this message:
MAT.4.18	 As
MAT.4.19	 He said to them, “Follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people.”
MAT.4.20	 They
MAT.4.21	 Going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat
MAT.4.22	 They
MAT.4.23	 Jesus
MAT.4.24	 So a report about him spread throughout Syria. People
MAT.4.25	 And large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis,
MAT.5.1	 When
MAT.5.2	 Then
MAT.5.3	 “Blessed
MAT.5.4	 “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
MAT.5.5	 “Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
MAT.5.6	 “Blessed are those who hunger

MAT.5.8	 “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
MAT.5.9	 “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children
MAT.5.10	 “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
MAT.5.11	 “Blessed are you when people
MAT.5.12	 Rejoice and be glad because your reward is great in heaven, for they persecuted the prophets before you in the same way.
MAT.5.13	 “You are the salt
MAT.5.14	 You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill cannot be hidden. 
MAT.5.15	 People
MAT.5.16	 In the same way, let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good deeds and give honor to your Father in heaven.
MAT.5.17	 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them.
MAT.5.18	 I
MAT.5.19	 So anyone who breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others
MAT.5.20	 For I tell you, unless your righteousness goes beyond that of the experts in the law
MAT.5.21	 “You have heard that it was said to an older generation,
MAT.5.22	 But I say to you that anyone who is angry with a brother
MAT.5.23	 So then, if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 
MAT.5.24	 leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your gift. 
MAT.5.25	 Reach agreement
MAT.5.26	 I tell you the truth,
MAT.5.27	 “You have heard that it was said, ‘
MAT.5.28	 But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 
MAT.5.29	 If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away! It is better to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
MAT.5.30	 If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away! It is better to lose one of your members than to have your whole body go into hell.
MAT.5.31	 “It was said, ‘
MAT.5.32	 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
MAT.5.33	 “Again, you have heard that it was said to an older generation,
MAT.5.34	 But I say to you, do not take oaths at all – not by heaven, because it is the throne of God, 
MAT.5.35	 not by earth, because it is his footstool, and not by Jerusalem,
MAT.5.36	 Do not take an oath by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black. 
MAT.5.37	 Let your word be ‘Yes, yes’ or ‘No, no.’ More than this is from the evil one.
MAT.5.38	 “You have heard that it was said, ‘
MAT.5.39	 But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer.
MAT.5.40	 And if someone wants to sue you and to take your tunic,
MAT.5.41	 And if anyone forces you to go one mile,
MAT.5.42	 Give to the one who asks you,
MAT.5.43	 “You have heard that it was said, ‘
MAT.5.44	 But I say to you, love your enemy and
MAT.5.45	 so that you may be like
MAT.5.46	 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Even the tax collectors
MAT.5.47	 And if you only greet your brothers, what more do you do? Even the Gentiles do the same, don’t they? 
MAT.5.48	 So then, be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
MAT.6.1	 “Be
MAT.6.2	 Thus whenever you do charitable giving,
MAT.6.3	 But when you do your giving, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 
MAT.6.4	 so that your gift may be in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.
MAT.6.5	 “Whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray while standing in synagogues
MAT.6.6	 But whenever you pray, go into your room,
MAT.6.7	 When
MAT.6.8	 Do
MAT.6.9	 So pray this way:
MAT.6.9	Our Father
MAT.6.10	 may your kingdom come,
MAT.6.10	may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. 
MAT.6.11	 Give us today our daily bread,
MAT.6.12	 and forgive us our debts, as we ourselves
MAT.6.13	 And do not lead us into temptation,

MAT.6.19	 “Do not accumulate for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth
MAT.6.20	 But accumulate for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. 
MAT.6.21	 For where your

MAT.6.26	 Look at the birds in the sky:
MAT.6.27	 And which of you by worrying can add even one hour to his life?
MAT.6.28	 Why do you worry about clothing? Think about how the flowers
MAT.6.29	 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these! 
MAT.6.30	 And if this is how God clothes the wild grass,
MAT.6.31	 So then, don’t worry saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ 
MAT.6.32	 For the unconverted
MAT.6.33	 But above all pursue his kingdom
MAT.6.34	 So then, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.
MAT.7.1	 “Do not judge so that you will not be judged.
MAT.7.2	 For by the standard you judge you will be judged, and the measure you use will be the measure you receive.
MAT.7.3	 Why
MAT.7.4	 Or how can you say
MAT.7.5	 You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye. 
MAT.7.6	 Do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs; otherwise they will trample them under their feet and turn around and tear you to pieces.
MAT.7.7	 “Ask
MAT.7.8	 For everyone who asks
MAT.7.9	 Is

MAT.7.14	 But the gate is narrow and the way is difficult that leads to life, and there are few who find it.
MAT.7.15	 “Watch out for false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are voracious wolves.
MAT.7.16	 You will recognize them by their fruit. Grapes are not gathered
MAT.7.17	 In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad
MAT.7.18	 A good tree is not able to bear bad fruit, nor a bad tree to bear good fruit. 
MAT.7.19	 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 
MAT.7.20	 So then, you will recognize them by their fruit.
MAT.7.21	 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’
MAT.7.22	 On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons and do
MAT.7.23	 Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you. Go away from me, you lawbreakers!’
MAT.7.24	 “Everyone
MAT.7.25	 The rain fell, the flood
MAT.7.26	 Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 
MAT.7.27	 The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, and it collapsed; it was utterly destroyed!”
MAT.7.28	 When
MAT.7.29	 because he taught them like one who had authority,
MAT.8.1	 After he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him. 
MAT.8.2	 And a leper
MAT.8.3	 He stretched out his hand and touched
MAT.8.4	 Then Jesus said to him, “See that you do not speak to anyone,
MAT.8.5	 When he entered Capernaum,
MAT.8.6	 “Lord,
MAT.8.7	 Jesus
MAT.8.8	 But the centurion replied,
MAT.8.9	 For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me.
MAT.8.10	 When
MAT.8.11	 I tell you, many will come from the east and west to share the banquet
MAT.8.12	 but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
MAT.8.13	 Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; just as you believed, it will be done for you.” And the servant
MAT.8.14	 Now
MAT.8.15	 He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then
MAT.8.16	 When it was evening, many demon-possessed people were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
MAT.8.17	 In this way what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled:
MAT.8.17	“
MAT.8.18	 Now when Jesus saw a large crowd
MAT.8.19	 Then
MAT.8.20	 Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens, and the birds in the sky
MAT.8.21	 Another
MAT.8.22	 But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”
MAT.8.23	 As he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
MAT.8.24	 And a great storm developed on the sea so that the waves began to swamp the boat. But he was asleep. 
MAT.8.25	 So they came
MAT.8.26	 But

MAT.9.1	 After getting into a boat he crossed to the other side and came to his own town.
MAT.9.2	 Just then
MAT.9.3	 Then
MAT.9.4	 When Jesus saw their reaction he said, “Why do you respond with evil in your hearts? 
MAT.9.5	 Which is easier,
MAT.9.6	 But so that you may know
MAT.9.7	 And he stood up and went home.
MAT.9.8	 When
MAT.9.9	 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth.
MAT.9.10	 As
MAT.9.11	 When the Pharisees
MAT.9.12	 When
MAT.9.13	 Go and learn what this saying means: ‘
MAT.9.14	 Then John’s
MAT.9.15	 Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests
MAT.9.16	 No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, because the patch will pull away from the garment and the tear will be worse. 
MAT.9.17	 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins;
MAT.9.18	 As he was saying these things, a ruler came, bowed low before him, and said, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her and she will live.” 
MAT.9.19	 Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him. 
MAT.9.20	 But
MAT.9.21	 For she kept saying to herself,
MAT.9.22	 But when Jesus turned and saw her he said, “Have courage, daughter! Your faith has made you well.”
MAT.9.23	 When Jesus entered the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly crowd, 
MAT.9.24	 he said, “Go away, for the girl is not dead but asleep.” And they began making fun of him.
MAT.9.25	 But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and gently took her by the hand, and the girl got up. 
MAT.9.26	 And the news of this spread throughout that region.
MAT.9.27	 As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting,
MAT.9.28	 When
MAT.9.29	 Then he touched their eyes saying, “Let it be done for you according to your faith.” 
MAT.9.30	 And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly warned them, “See that no one knows about this.” 
MAT.9.31	 But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that entire region.
MAT.9.32	 As
MAT.9.33	 After the demon was cast out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowds were amazed and said, “Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!” 
MAT.9.34	 But the Pharisees
MAT.9.35	 Then Jesus went throughout all the towns
MAT.9.36	 When
MAT.9.37	 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. 
MAT.9.38	 Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest
MAT.10.1	 Jesus
MAT.10.2	 Now these are the names of the twelve apostles:
MAT.10.3	 Philip and Bartholomew;
MAT.10.4	 Simon the Zealot
MAT.10.5	 Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them as follows:
MAT.10.6	 Go
MAT.10.7	 As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near!’ 
MAT.10.8	 Heal the sick, raise the dead,
MAT.10.9	 Do not take gold, silver, or copper in your belts, 
MAT.10.10	 no bag
MAT.10.11	 Whenever
MAT.10.12	 As you enter the house, give it greetings.
MAT.10.13	 And if the house is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
MAT.10.14	 And if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your message, shake the dust off
MAT.10.15	 I tell you the truth,
MAT.10.16	 “I
MAT.10.17	 Beware
MAT.10.18	 And you will be brought before governors and kings
MAT.10.19	 Whenever

MAT.10.23	 Whenever
MAT.10.24	 “A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a slave
MAT.10.25	 It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the head of the house ‘Beelzebul,’ how much more will they defame the members of his household!
MAT.10.26	 “Do

MAT.11.1	 When
MAT.11.2	 Now when John
MAT.11.3	 “Are you the one who is to come,
MAT.11.4	 Jesus answered them,
MAT.11.5	 The blind see, the

MAT.11.7	 While they were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness
MAT.11.8	 What
MAT.11.9	 What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more
MAT.11.10	 This is the one about whom it is written:

MAT.11.19	 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at him,

MAT.11.21	 “Woe to you, Chorazin!
MAT.11.22	 But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you! 
MAT.11.23	 And you, Capernaum,
MAT.11.24	 But I tell you, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom
MAT.11.25	 At that time Jesus said,
MAT.11.26	 Yes, Father, for this was your gracious will.
MAT.11.27	 All things have been handed over to me by my Father.
MAT.11.28	 Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 
MAT.11.29	 Take my yoke
MAT.11.30	 For my yoke is easy to bear, and my load is not hard to carry.”
MAT.12.1	 At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on a Sabbath. His
MAT.12.2	 But when the Pharisees
MAT.12.3	 He
MAT.12.4	 how he entered the house of God and they ate
MAT.12.5	 Or have you not read in the law that the priests in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are not guilty? 
MAT.12.6	 I
MAT.12.7	 If
MAT.12.8	 For the Son of Man is lord
MAT.12.9	 Then
MAT.12.10	 A
MAT.12.11	 He said to them, “Would not any one of you, if he had one sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath, take hold of it and lift it out? 
MAT.12.12	 How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.” 
MAT.12.13	 Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out and it was restored,
MAT.12.14	 But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, as to how they could assassinate
MAT.12.15	 Now when Jesus learned of this, he went away from there. Great
MAT.12.16	 But he sternly warned them not to make him known. 
MAT.12.17	 This fulfilled what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet:
MAT.12.18	 “
MAT.12.22	 Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute. Jesus
MAT.12.23	 All the crowds were amazed and said, “Could this one be the Son of David?” 
MAT.12.24	 But when the Pharisees
MAT.12.25	 Now when Jesus
MAT.12.26	 So if
MAT.12.27	 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons
MAT.12.28	 But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God
MAT.12.29	 How
MAT.12.30	 Whoever is not with me is against me,
MAT.12.31	 For this reason I tell you, people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy,
MAT.12.32	 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven.
MAT.12.33	 “Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad
MAT.12.34	 Offspring of vipers! How are you able to say anything good, since you are evil? For the mouth speaks from what fills the heart. 
MAT.12.35	 The good person
MAT.12.36	 I
MAT.12.37	 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”
MAT.12.38	 Then some of the experts in the law
MAT.12.39	 But he answered them,
MAT.12.40	 For just as Jonah was 
MAT.12.41	 The people
MAT.12.42	 The queen of the South
MAT.12.43	 “When
MAT.12.44	 Then it says, ‘I will return to the home I left.’
MAT.12.45	 Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there, so
MAT.12.46	 While Jesus
MAT.12.47	 Someone
MAT.12.48	 To the one who had said this, Jesus
MAT.12.49	 And pointing
MAT.12.50	 For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is
MAT.13.1	 On that day after Jesus went out of the house, he sat by the lake. 
MAT.13.2	 And such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat to sit while
MAT.13.3	 He
MAT.13.4	 And as he sowed, some seeds
MAT.13.5	 Other
MAT.13.6	 But when the sun came up, they were scorched, and because they did not have sufficient root, they withered. 
MAT.13.7	 Other seeds fell among the thorns,
MAT.13.8	 But other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. 
MAT.13.9	 The one who has ears had better listen!”
MAT.13.10	 Then
MAT.13.11	 He replied,
MAT.13.12	 For whoever has will be given more, and will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
MAT.13.13	 For this reason I speak to them in parables: Although they see they do not see, and although they hear they do not hear nor do they understand. 
MAT.13.14	 And concerning them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: 
MAT.13.14	‘
MAT.13.15	’
MAT.13.16	 “But your eyes are blessed
MAT.13.17	 For I tell you the truth,
MAT.13.18	 “So listen to the parable of the sower: 
MAT.13.19	 When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one
MAT.13.20	 The
MAT.13.21	 But he has no root in himself and does not endure;
MAT.13.22	 The
MAT.13.23	 But as for the seed sown on good soil, this is the person who hears the word and understands. He bears fruit, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.”
MAT.13.24	 He presented them with another parable:
MAT.13.25	 But while everyone was sleeping, an enemy came and sowed weeds
MAT.13.26	 When
MAT.13.27	 So the slaves
MAT.13.28	 He said, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So
MAT.13.29	 But he said, ‘No, since in gathering the weeds you may uproot the wheat with them. 
MAT.13.30	 Let both grow together until the harvest. At
MAT.13.31	 He gave
MAT.13.32	 It is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest garden plant and becomes a tree,
MAT.13.33	 He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with
MAT.13.34	 Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds; he did not speak to them without a parable. 
MAT.13.35	 This fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet:
MAT.13.35	“
MAT.13.35	”
MAT.13.36	 Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.” 
MAT.13.37	 He
MAT.13.38	 The field is the world and the good seed are the people
MAT.13.39	 and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. 
MAT.13.40	 As
MAT.13.41	 The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom everything that causes sin as well as all lawbreakers.
MAT.13.42	 They will 
MAT.13.43	 Then 
MAT.13.44	 “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure, hidden in a field, that a person found and hid. Then because of joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
MAT.13.45	 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls. 
MAT.13.46	 When he found a pearl of great value, he went out and sold everything he had and bought it.
MAT.13.47	 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea that caught all kinds of fish. 
MAT.13.48	 When it was full, they pulled it ashore, sat down, and put the good fish into containers and threw the bad away. 
MAT.13.49	 It will be this way at the end of the age. Angels will come and separate the evil from the righteous 
MAT.13.50	 and 
MAT.13.51	 “Have you understood all these things?” They replied, “Yes.” 
MAT.13.52	 Then he said to them, “Therefore every expert in the law
MAT.13.53	 Now when
MAT.13.54	 Then
MAT.13.55	 Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother named Mary?
MAT.13.56	 And aren’t all his sisters here with us? Where did he get all this?”
MAT.13.57	 And so they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own house.” 
MAT.13.58	 And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.1	 At that time Herod the tetrarch
MAT.14.2	 and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead! And because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him.” 
MAT.14.3	 For Herod had arrested John, bound him,
MAT.14.4	 because John had repeatedly told
MAT.14.5	 Although
MAT.14.6	 But on Herod’s birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod, 
MAT.14.7	 so much that he promised with an oath
MAT.14.8	 Instructed by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.” 
MAT.14.9	 Although it grieved the king,
MAT.14.10	 So
MAT.14.11	 His
MAT.14.12	 Then John’s
MAT.14.13	 Now when Jesus heard this he went away from there privately in a boat to an isolated place. But when the crowd heard about it,
MAT.14.14	 As he got out he saw the large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. 
MAT.14.15	 When evening arrived, his disciples came to him saying, “This is an isolated place
MAT.14.16	 But he
MAT.14.17	 They
MAT.14.18	 “Bring them here to me,” he replied. 
MAT.14.19	 Then
MAT.14.20	 They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, twelve baskets full. 
MAT.14.21	 Not counting women and children, there were about five thousand men who ate.
MAT.14.22	 Immediately Jesus
MAT.14.23	 And after he sent the crowds away, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone. 
MAT.14.24	 Meanwhile the boat, already far from land,
MAT.14.25	 As the night was ending,
MAT.14.26	 When
MAT.14.27	 But immediately Jesus
MAT.14.28	 Peter
MAT.14.29	 So he said, “Come.” Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	 But when he saw the strong wind he became afraid. And starting to sink, he cried out,
MAT.14.31	 Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” 
MAT.14.32	 When they went up into the boat, the wind ceased. 
MAT.14.33	 Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”
MAT.14.34	 After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
MAT.14.35	 When the people
MAT.14.36	 They begged him if
MAT.15.1	 Then Pharisees
MAT.15.2	 “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their
MAT.15.3	 He answered them,
MAT.15.4	 For God said,
MAT.15.5	 But you say, ‘If someone tells his father or mother, “Whatever help you would have received from me is given to God,”
MAT.15.6	 he does not need to honor his father.’
MAT.15.7	 Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said, 
MAT.15.8	 ‘
MAT.15.9	’”
MAT.15.10	 Then he called the crowd to him and said,
MAT.15.11	 What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth; it is what
MAT.15.12	 Then the disciples came to him and said, “Do you know that when the Pharisees
MAT.15.13	 And he replied,
MAT.15.14	 Leave them! They are blind guides.
MAT.15.15	 But Peter
MAT.15.16	 Jesus
MAT.15.17	 Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and then passes out into the sewer?
MAT.15.18	 But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a person. 
MAT.15.19	 For out of the heart come evil ideas, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. 
MAT.15.20	 These are the things that defile a person; it is not eating with unwashed hands that defiles a person.”
MAT.15.21	 After going out from there, Jesus went to the region of Tyre
MAT.15.22	 A
MAT.15.23	 But he did not answer her a word. Then
MAT.15.24	 So
MAT.15.25	 But she came and bowed down
MAT.15.26	 “It is not right
MAT.15.27	 “Yes, Lord,” she replied,
MAT.15.28	 Then
MAT.15.29	 When he left there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain, where he sat down. 
MAT.15.30	 Then
MAT.15.31	 As a result, the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.
MAT.15.32	 Then Jesus called the
MAT.15.33	 The disciples said to him, “Where can we get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?” 
MAT.15.34	 Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven – and a few small fish.” 
MAT.15.35	 After instructing the crowd to sit down on the ground, 
MAT.15.36	 he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowds.
MAT.15.37	 They
MAT.15.38	 Not counting children and women,
MAT.15.39	 After sending away the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
MAT.16.1	 Now when the Pharisees
MAT.16.2	 He
MAT.16.3	 and in the morning, ‘It will be stormy today, because the sky is red and darkening.’
MAT.16.4	 A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” Then
MAT.16.5	 When the disciples went to the other side, they forgot to take bread. 
MAT.16.6	 “Watch out,” Jesus said to them, “beware of the yeast of the Pharisees
MAT.16.7	 So
MAT.16.8	 When Jesus learned of this,
MAT.16.9	 Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up? 
MAT.16.10	 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up? 
MAT.16.11	 How could you not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!” 
MAT.16.12	 Then they understood that he had not told them to be on guard against the yeast in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	 When
MAT.16.14	 They answered, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah,
MAT.16.15	 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” 
MAT.16.16	 Simon Peter answered,
MAT.16.17	 And Jesus answered him,
MAT.16.18	 And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades
MAT.16.19	 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.” 
MAT.16.20	 Then he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.
MAT.16.21	 From that time on
MAT.16.22	 So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him:
MAT.16.23	 But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.”
MAT.16.24	 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to become my follower,
MAT.16.25	 For whoever wants to save his life
MAT.16.26	 For what does it benefit a person
MAT.16.27	 For the Son of Man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then 
MAT.16.28	 I tell you the truth,
MAT.17.1	 Six days later
MAT.17.2	 And he was transfigured before them.
MAT.17.3	 Then Moses
MAT.17.4	 So
MAT.17.5	 While he was still speaking, a
MAT.17.6	 When the disciples heard this, they were overwhelmed with fear and threw themselves down with their faces to the ground.
MAT.17.7	 But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Do not be afraid.” 
MAT.17.8	 When
MAT.17.9	 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them,
MAT.17.10	 The disciples asked him,
MAT.17.11	 He
MAT.17.12	 And I tell you that Elijah has already come. Yet they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted. In
MAT.17.13	 Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	 When
MAT.17.15	 and said, “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he has seizures
MAT.17.16	 I brought him to your disciples, but
MAT.17.17	 Jesus answered,
MAT.17.18	 Then
MAT.17.19	 Then the disciples came
MAT.17.20	 He told them, “It was because of your little faith. I tell you the truth,
MAT.17.22	 When
MAT.17.23	 They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised.” And they became greatly distressed.
MAT.17.24	 After
MAT.17.25	 He said, “Yes.” When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first,
MAT.17.26	 After he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons
MAT.17.27	 But so that we don’t offend them, go to the lake and throw out a hook. Take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth, you will find a four drachma coin.
MAT.18.1	 At that time the disciples came to Jesus saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 
MAT.18.2	 He called a child, had him stand among them, 
MAT.18.3	 and said, “I tell you the truth,
MAT.18.4	 Whoever then humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.18.5	 And whoever welcomes
MAT.18.6	 “But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin,
MAT.18.7	 Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! It
MAT.18.8	 If
MAT.18.9	 And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have
MAT.18.10	 “See that you do not disdain one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
MAT.18.12	 What do you think? If someone
MAT.18.13	 And if he finds it, I tell you the truth,
MAT.18.14	 In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that one of these little ones be lost.
MAT.18.15	 “If
MAT.18.16	 But if he does not listen, take one or two others with you, so that 
MAT.18.17	 If
MAT.18.18	 “I tell you the truth,
MAT.18.19	 Again, I tell you the truth,
MAT.18.20	 For where two or three are assembled in my name, I am there among them.”
MAT.18.21	 Then Peter came to him and said, “Lord, how many times must I forgive my brother
MAT.18.22	 Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, I tell you, but seventy-seven times!
MAT.18.23	 “For this reason, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.
MAT.18.24	 As
MAT.18.25	 Because
MAT.18.26	 Then the slave threw himself to the ground
MAT.18.27	 The lord had compassion on that slave and released him, and forgave him the debt. 
MAT.18.28	 After
MAT.18.29	 Then his fellow slave threw himself down and begged him,
MAT.18.30	 But he refused. Instead, he went out and threw him in prison until he repaid the debt. 
MAT.18.31	 When
MAT.18.32	 Then his lord called the first slave
MAT.18.33	 Should you not have shown mercy to your fellow slave, just as I showed it to you?’ 
MAT.18.34	 And in anger his lord turned him over to the prison guards to torture him
MAT.18.35	 So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if each of you does not forgive your
MAT.19.1	 Now when
MAT.19.2	 Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
MAT.19.3	 Then some Pharisees
MAT.19.4	 He answered, “Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator 
MAT.19.5	 and said, ‘
MAT.19.6	 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.” 
MAT.19.7	 They said to him, “Why then did Moses command us 
MAT.19.8	 Jesus
MAT.19.9	 Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another commits adultery.” 
MAT.19.10	 The
MAT.19.11	 He
MAT.19.12	 For there are some eunuchs who were that way from birth,
MAT.19.13	 Then little children were brought to him for him to lay his hands on them and pray.
MAT.19.14	 But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”
MAT.19.15	 And he placed his hands on them and went on his way.
MAT.19.16	 Now
MAT.19.17	 He said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” 
MAT.19.18	 “Which ones?” he asked. Jesus replied, “
MAT.19.20	 The young man said to him, “I have wholeheartedly obeyed
MAT.19.21	 Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go sell your possessions and give the money
MAT.19.22	 But when the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.
MAT.19.23	 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “I tell you the truth,
MAT.19.24	 Again I say,
MAT.19.25	 The
MAT.19.26	 Jesus
MAT.19.27	 Then Peter said
MAT.19.28	 Jesus
MAT.19.29	 And whoever has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much
MAT.19.30	 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
MAT.20.1	 “For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner
MAT.20.2	 And after agreeing with the workers for the standard wage,
MAT.20.3	 When it was about nine o’clock in the morning,
MAT.20.4	 He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and I will give you whatever is right.’ 
MAT.20.5	 So they went. When
MAT.20.6	 And about five o’clock that afternoon
MAT.20.7	 They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go and work in the vineyard too.’ 
MAT.20.8	 When
MAT.20.9	 When those hired about five o’clock came, each received a full day’s pay.
MAT.20.10	 And when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more. But each one also received the standard wage. 
MAT.20.11	 When
MAT.20.12	 saying, ‘These last fellows worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the hardship and burning heat of the day.’ 
MAT.20.13	 And the landowner
MAT.20.14	 Take what is yours and go. I
MAT.20.15	 Am I not
MAT.20.16	 So the last will be first, and the first last.”
MAT.20.17	 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem,
MAT.20.18	 “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the experts in the law.
MAT.20.19	 and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged severely
MAT.20.20	 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, and kneeling down she asked him for a favor.
MAT.20.21	 He said to her, “What do you want?” She replied,
MAT.20.22	 Jesus
MAT.20.23	 He told them, “You will drink my cup,
MAT.20.24	 Now
MAT.20.25	 But Jesus called them and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions use their authority over them. 
MAT.20.26	 It must not be this way among you! Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant, 
MAT.20.27	 and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave
MAT.20.28	 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom
MAT.20.29	 As they were leaving Jericho,
MAT.20.30	 Two
MAT.20.31	 The
MAT.20.32	 Jesus stopped, called them, and said, “What do you want me to do for you?” 
MAT.20.33	 They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.” 
MAT.20.34	 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.
MAT.21.1	 Now
MAT.21.2	 telling them, “Go to the village ahead of you.
MAT.21.3	 If anyone says anything to you, you are to say, ‘The Lord needs them,’
MAT.21.4	 This
MAT.21.5	 “
MAT.21.5	‘
MAT.21.5	’”
MAT.21.6	 So
MAT.21.7	 They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks
MAT.21.8	 A
MAT.21.9	 The crowds that went ahead of him and those following kept shouting,
MAT.21.10	 As he entered Jerusalem the whole city was thrown into an uproar,
MAT.21.11	 And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth
MAT.21.12	 Then
MAT.21.13	 And he said to them, “It is written, ‘
MAT.21.14	 The blind and lame came to him in the temple courts, and he healed them. 
MAT.21.15	 But when the chief priests and the experts in the law
MAT.21.16	 and said to him, “Do you hear what they are saying?” Jesus said to them, “Yes. Have you never read, ‘
MAT.21.17	 And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.
MAT.21.18	 Now early in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry. 
MAT.21.19	 After noticing a fig tree
MAT.21.20	 When the disciples saw it they were amazed, saying, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” 
MAT.21.21	 Jesus
MAT.21.22	 And whatever you ask in prayer, if you believe,
MAT.21.23	 Now after Jesus
MAT.21.24	 Jesus
MAT.21.25	 Where did John’s baptism come from? From heaven or from people?”
MAT.21.26	 But if we say, ‘From people,’ we fear the crowd, for they all consider John to be a prophet.” 
MAT.21.27	 So
MAT.21.28	 “What
MAT.21.29	 The boy answered,
MAT.21.30	 The father
MAT.21.31	 Which of the two did his father’s will?” They said, “The first.”
MAT.21.32	 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe. Although
MAT.21.33	 “Listen to another parable: There was a landowner
MAT.21.34	 When the harvest time was near, he sent his slaves
MAT.21.35	 But the tenants seized his slaves, beat one,
MAT.21.36	 Again he sent other slaves, more than the first, and they treated them the same way. 
MAT.21.37	 Finally he sent his son to them,
MAT.21.38	 But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and get his inheritance!’ 
MAT.21.39	 So
MAT.21.40	 Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” 
MAT.21.41	 They said to him, “He will utterly destroy those evil men! Then he will lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his portion at the harvest.” 
MAT.21.42	 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures: 
MAT.21.42	‘
MAT.21.42	’?
MAT.21.43	 For this reason I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people
MAT.21.44	 The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls will be crushed.”
MAT.21.45	 When
MAT.21.46	 They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, because the crowds
MAT.22.1	 Jesus spoke
MAT.22.2	 “The kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son. 
MAT.22.3	 He sent his slaves
MAT.22.4	 Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, “Look! The feast I have prepared for you is ready.
MAT.22.5	 But they were indifferent and went away, one to his farm, another to his business. 
MAT.22.6	 The
MAT.22.7	 The
MAT.22.8	 Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding is ready, but the ones who had been invited were not worthy. 
MAT.22.9	 So go into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.’ 
MAT.22.10	 And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all they found, both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 
MAT.22.11	 But when the king came in to see the wedding guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 
MAT.22.12	 And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But he had nothing to say.
MAT.22.13	 Then the king said to his attendants, ‘Tie him up hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!’ 
MAT.22.14	 For many are called, but few are chosen.”
MAT.22.15	 Then the Pharisees
MAT.22.16	 They sent to him their disciples along with the Herodians,
MAT.22.17	 Tell us then, what do you think? Is it right
MAT.22.18	 But Jesus realized their evil intentions and said, “Hypocrites! Why are you testing me? 
MAT.22.19	 Show me the coin used for the tax.” So
MAT.22.20	 Jesus
MAT.22.21	 They replied,
MAT.22.22	 Now when they heard this they were stunned,
MAT.22.23	 The same day Sadducees
MAT.22.24	 “Teacher, Moses said, ‘
MAT.22.25	 Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children he left his wife to his brother. 
MAT.22.26	 The second did the same, and the third, down to the seventh. 
MAT.22.27	 Last
MAT.22.28	 In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.”
MAT.22.29	 Jesus
MAT.22.30	 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels
MAT.22.31	 Now as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God,
MAT.22.32	 ‘
MAT.22.33	 When the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching.
MAT.22.34	 Now when the Pharisees
MAT.22.35	 And one of them, an expert in religious law,
MAT.22.36	 “Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”
MAT.22.37	 Jesus
MAT.22.38	 This is the first and greatest
MAT.22.39	 The second is like it: ‘
MAT.22.40	 All the law and the prophets depend
MAT.22.41	 While
MAT.22.42	 “What do you think about the Christ?
MAT.22.43	 He said to them, “How then does David by the Spirit call him ‘Lord,’ saying,
MAT.22.44	 ‘
MAT.22.44	“
MAT.22.44	”’?
MAT.22.45	 If David then calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”
MAT.22.46	 No one
MAT.23.1	 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 
MAT.23.2	 “The
MAT.23.3	 Therefore pay attention to what they tell you and do it. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they teach.
MAT.23.4	 They
MAT.23.5	 They
MAT.23.6	 They
MAT.23.7	 and elaborate greetings
MAT.23.8	 But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher and you are all brothers. 
MAT.23.9	 And call no one your ‘father’ on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. 
MAT.23.10	 Nor are you to be called ‘teacher,’ for you have one teacher, the Christ.
MAT.23.11	 The
MAT.23.12	 And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
MAT.23.13	 “But woe to you, experts in the law
MAT.23.15	 “Woe to you, experts in the law
MAT.23.16	 “Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing.
MAT.23.17	 Blind fools! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred? 
MAT.23.18	 And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing.
MAT.23.19	 You are blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? 
MAT.23.20	 So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. 
MAT.23.21	 And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and the one who dwells in it. 
MAT.23.22	 And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and the one who sits on it.
MAT.23.23	 “Woe to you, experts in the law
MAT.23.24	 Blind guides! You strain out a gnat yet swallow a camel!
MAT.23.25	 “Woe to you, experts in the law
MAT.23.26	 Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup,
MAT.23.27	 “Woe to you, experts in the law
MAT.23.28	 In the same way, on the outside you look righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
MAT.23.29	 “Woe to you, experts in the law
MAT.23.30	 And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors,
MAT.23.31	 By saying this you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets. 
MAT.23.32	 Fill up then the measure of your ancestors! 
MAT.23.33	 You snakes, you offspring of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?
MAT.23.34	 “For this reason I
MAT.23.35	 so that on you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah,
MAT.23.36	 I tell you the truth,
MAT.23.37	 “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
MAT.23.38	 Look, your house is left to you desolate! 
MAT.23.39	 For I tell you, you will not see me from now until you say, ‘
MAT.24.1	 Now
MAT.24.2	 And he said to them,
MAT.24.3	 As
MAT.24.4	 Jesus answered them,
MAT.24.5	 For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’
MAT.24.6	 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Make sure that you are not alarmed, for this must happen, but the end is still to come.
MAT.24.7	 For nation will rise up in arms
MAT.24.8	 All
MAT.24.9	 “Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and will kill you. You will be hated by all the nations
MAT.24.10	 Then many will be led into sin,
MAT.24.11	 And many false prophets will appear and deceive
MAT.24.12	 and because lawlessness will increase so much, the love of many will grow cold. 
MAT.24.13	 But the person who endures to the end will be saved.
MAT.24.14	 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole inhabited earth as a testimony to all the nations,
MAT.24.15	 “So when you see 
MAT.24.16	 then those in Judea must flee
MAT.24.17	 The one on the roof
MAT.24.18	 and the one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. 
MAT.24.19	 Woe
MAT.24.20	 Pray
MAT.24.21	 For then there will be great suffering
MAT.24.22	 And if those days had not been cut short, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. 
MAT.24.23	 Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’
MAT.24.24	 For false messiahs
MAT.24.25	 Remember,
MAT.24.26	 So then, if someone
MAT.24.27	 For just like the lightning
MAT.24.28	 Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures
MAT.24.29	 “Immediately
MAT.24.30	 Then
MAT.24.31	 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet blast, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven
MAT.24.32	 “Learn
MAT.24.33	 So also you, when you see all these things, know
MAT.24.34	 I tell you the truth,
MAT.24.35	 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
MAT.24.36	 “But as for that day and hour no one knows it – not even the angels in heaven
MAT.24.37	 For just like the days of Noah
MAT.24.38	 For in those days before the flood, people
MAT.24.39	 And they knew nothing until the flood came and took them all away.
MAT.24.40	 Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one left.
MAT.24.41	 There will be two women grinding grain with a mill;
MAT.24.42	 “Therefore stay alert, because you do not know on what day
MAT.24.43	 But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief
MAT.24.44	 Therefore you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
MAT.24.45	 “Who then is the faithful and wise slave,
MAT.24.46	 Blessed is that slave whom the master finds at work
MAT.24.47	 I tell you the truth,
MAT.24.48	 But if
MAT.24.49	 and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and to eat and drink with drunkards, 
MAT.24.50	 then the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not foresee, 
MAT.24.51	 and will cut him in two,
MAT.25.1	 “At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 
MAT.25.2	 Five
MAT.25.3	 When
MAT.25.4	 But the wise ones took flasks of olive oil with their lamps. 
MAT.25.5	 When
MAT.25.6	 But at midnight there was a shout, ‘Look, the bridegroom is here! Come out to meet him.’
MAT.25.7	 Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 
MAT.25.8	 The
MAT.25.9	 ‘No,’ they replied.
MAT.25.10	 But while they had gone to buy it, the bridegroom arrived, and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding banquet. Then
MAT.25.11	 Later,
MAT.25.12	 But he replied,
MAT.25.13	 Therefore stay alert, because you do not know the day or the hour.
MAT.25.14	 “For it is like a man going on a journey, who summoned his slaves
MAT.25.15	 To
MAT.25.16	 The one who had received five talents went off right away and put his money to work
MAT.25.17	 In the same way, the one who had two gained two more. 
MAT.25.18	 But the one who had received one talent went out and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money in it. 
MAT.25.19	 After
MAT.25.20	 The
MAT.25.21	 His master answered,
MAT.25.22	 The
MAT.25.23	 His master answered, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 
MAT.25.24	 Then the one who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Sir, I knew that you were a hard man, harvesting where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed, 
MAT.25.25	 so
MAT.25.26	 But his master answered,
MAT.25.27	 Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers,
MAT.25.28	 Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten.
MAT.25.29	 For the one who has will be given more,
MAT.25.30	 And throw that worthless slave into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
MAT.25.31	 “When
MAT.25.32	 All
MAT.25.33	 He
MAT.25.34	 Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 
MAT.25.35	 For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 
MAT.25.36	 I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.’ 
MAT.25.37	 Then the righteous will answer him,
MAT.25.38	 When
MAT.25.39	 When
MAT.25.40	 And the king will answer them,
MAT.25.41	 “Then he will say
MAT.25.42	 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink. 
MAT.25.43	 I was a stranger and you did not receive me as a guest, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ 
MAT.25.44	 Then they too will answer,
MAT.25.45	 Then he will answer them,
MAT.25.46	 And these will depart into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”
MAT.26.1	 When
MAT.26.2	 “You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over
MAT.26.3	 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met together in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas. 
MAT.26.4	 They
MAT.26.5	 But they said, “Not during the feast, so that there won’t be a riot among the people.”
MAT.26.6	 Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, 
MAT.26.7	 a woman came to him with an alabaster jar
MAT.26.8	 When
MAT.26.9	 It
MAT.26.10	 When
MAT.26.11	 For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me!
MAT.26.12	 When
MAT.26.13	 I tell you the truth,
MAT.26.14	 Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 
MAT.26.15	 and said, “What will you give me to betray him into your hands?”
MAT.26.16	 From that time
MAT.26.17	 Now on the first day of the feast of
MAT.26.18	 He
MAT.26.19	 So
MAT.26.20	 When
MAT.26.21	 And while they were eating he said, “I tell you the truth,
MAT.26.22	 They
MAT.26.23	 He
MAT.26.24	 The Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had never been born.” 
MAT.26.25	 Then
MAT.26.26	 While
MAT.26.27	 And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you, 
MAT.26.28	 for this is my blood, the blood
MAT.26.29	 I
MAT.26.30	 After
MAT.26.31	 Then Jesus said to them, “This night you will all fall away because of me, for it is written: 
MAT.26.31	‘
MAT.26.31	’
MAT.26.32	 But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” 
MAT.26.33	 Peter
MAT.26.34	 Jesus said to him, “I tell you the truth,
MAT.26.35	 Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you.” And all the disciples said the same thing.
MAT.26.36	 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” 
MAT.26.37	 He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became anguished and distressed. 
MAT.26.38	 Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.” 
MAT.26.39	 Going a little farther, he threw himself down with his face to the ground and prayed,
MAT.26.40	 Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He
MAT.26.41	 Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.” 
MAT.26.42	 He went away a second time and prayed,
MAT.26.43	 He came again and found them sleeping; they could not keep their eyes open.
MAT.26.44	 So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing once more. 
MAT.26.45	 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is approaching, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
MAT.26.46	 Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer
MAT.26.47	 While he was still speaking, Judas,
MAT.26.48	 (Now the betrayer
MAT.26.49	 Immediately
MAT.26.50	 Jesus
MAT.26.51	 But
MAT.26.52	 Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its place!
MAT.26.53	 Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and that he would send me more than twelve legions
MAT.26.54	 How then would the scriptures that say it must happen this way be fulfilled?” 
MAT.26.55	 At that moment Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw?
MAT.26.56	 But this has happened so that
MAT.26.57	 Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, in whose house
MAT.26.58	 But Peter was following him from a distance, all the way to the high priest’s courtyard. After
MAT.26.59	 The
MAT.26.60	 But they did not find anything, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally
MAT.26.61	 and declared, “This man

MAT.26.63	 But Jesus was silent. The
MAT.26.64	 Jesus said to him, “You have said it yourself. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man 
MAT.26.65	 Then the high priest tore his clothes and declared,
MAT.26.66	 What is your verdict?”
MAT.26.67	 Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. And some slapped him, 
MAT.26.68	 saying, “Prophesy for us, you Christ!
MAT.26.69	 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A
MAT.26.70	 But he denied it in front of them all:
MAT.26.71	 When
MAT.26.72	 He denied it again with an oath, “I do not know the man!” 
MAT.26.73	 After
MAT.26.74	 At that he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, “I do not know the man!” At that moment a rooster crowed.
MAT.26.75	 Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.
MAT.27.1	 When
MAT.27.2	 They
MAT.27.3	 Now when
MAT.27.4	 saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What is that to us? You take care of it yourself!” 
MAT.27.5	 So
MAT.27.6	 The
MAT.27.7	 After
MAT.27.8	 For this reason that field has been called the “Field of Blood” to this day. 
MAT.27.9	 Then what was spoken by Jeremiah
MAT.27.11	 Then
MAT.27.12	 But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not respond. 
MAT.27.13	 Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many charges they are bringing against you?” 
MAT.27.14	 But he did not answer even one accusation, so that the governor was quite amazed.
MAT.27.15	 During the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd,
MAT.27.16	 At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus
MAT.27.17	 So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus
MAT.27.18	 (For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.)
MAT.27.19	 As
MAT.27.20	 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed. 
MAT.27.21	 The
MAT.27.22	 Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?”
MAT.27.23	 He asked, “Why? What wrong has he done?” But they shouted more insistently, “Crucify him!”
MAT.27.24	 When
MAT.27.25	 In
MAT.27.26	 Then he released Barabbas for them. But after he had Jesus flogged,
MAT.27.27	 Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s residence
MAT.27.28	 They
MAT.27.29	 and after braiding
MAT.27.30	 They
MAT.27.31	 When
MAT.27.32	 As
MAT.27.33	 They
MAT.27.34	 and offered Jesus
MAT.27.35	 When
MAT.27.36	 Then they sat down and kept guard over him there. 
MAT.27.37	 Above
MAT.27.38	 Then two outlaws were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. 
MAT.27.39	 Those
MAT.27.40	 and saying, “You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself!
MAT.27.41	 In
MAT.27.42	 “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the king of Israel! If he comes down
MAT.27.43	 H
MAT.27.44	 The
MAT.27.45	 Now from noon until three,
MAT.27.46	 At
MAT.27.47	 When
MAT.27.48	 Immediately
MAT.27.49	 But the rest said, “Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah will come to save him.”
MAT.27.50	 Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit. 
MAT.27.51	 Just then
MAT.27.52	 And tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had died
MAT.27.53	 (They
MAT.27.54	 Now when the centurion
MAT.27.55	 Many
MAT.27.56	 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
MAT.27.57	 Now
MAT.27.58	 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
MAT.27.59	 Joseph
MAT.27.60	 and placed it
MAT.27.61	 (Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there, opposite the tomb.)
MAT.27.62	 The
MAT.27.63	 and said, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ 
MAT.27.64	 So give orders to secure the tomb until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal his body
MAT.27.65	 Pilate said to them, “Take
MAT.27.66	 So
MAT.28.1	 Now after the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. 
MAT.28.2	 Suddenly there was a severe earthquake, for an angel of the Lord
MAT.28.3	 His
MAT.28.4	 The
MAT.28.5	 But the angel said
MAT.28.6	 He is not here, for he has been raised,
MAT.28.7	 Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead. He
MAT.28.8	 So
MAT.28.9	 But
MAT.28.10	 Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.”
MAT.28.11	 While
MAT.28.12	 After
MAT.28.13	 telling them, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came at night and stole his body
MAT.28.14	 If
MAT.28.15	 So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story is told among the Jews to this day.
MAT.28.16	 So
MAT.28.17	 When
MAT.28.18	 Then Jesus came up and said to them,
MAT.28.19	 Therefore go
MAT.28.20	 teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember,
MRK.1.1	 The beginning of the gospel
MRK.1.2	 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,
MRK.1.2	“
MRK.1.3	‘
MRK.1.3	’”
MRK.1.4	 In the wilderness
MRK.1.5	 People
MRK.1.6	 John wore a garment made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
MRK.1.7	 He proclaimed,
MRK.1.8	 I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
MRK.1.9	 Now
MRK.1.10	 And just as Jesus
MRK.1.11	 And a voice came from heaven: “You are my one dear Son;
MRK.1.12	 The Spirit immediately drove him into the wilderness. 
MRK.1.13	 He was in the wilderness forty days,
MRK.1.14	 Now after John was imprisoned,
MRK.1.15	 He
MRK.1.16	 As he went along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen).
MRK.1.17	 Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people.”
MRK.1.18	 They left their nets immediately and followed him.
MRK.1.19	 Going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother in their
MRK.1.20	 Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
MRK.1.21	 Then
MRK.1.22	 The people there
MRK.1.23	 Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit,
MRK.1.24	 “Leave us alone,
MRK.1.25	 But
MRK.1.26	 After throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him. 
MRK.1.27	 They were all amazed so that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.” 
MRK.1.28	 So
MRK.1.29	 Now
MRK.1.30	 Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, sick with a fever, so
MRK.1.31	 He came and raised her up by gently taking her hand. Then the fever left her and she began to serve
MRK.1.32	 When it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and demon-possessed. 
MRK.1.33	 The whole town gathered by the door. 
MRK.1.34	 So
MRK.1.35	 Then
MRK.1.36	 Simon and his companions searched for him. 
MRK.1.37	 When they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you.” 
MRK.1.38	 He replied,
MRK.1.39	 So
MRK.1.40	 Now
MRK.1.41	 Moved with compassion,
MRK.1.42	 The leprosy left him at once, and he was clean. 
MRK.1.43	 Immediately Jesus
MRK.1.44	 He told him,
MRK.1.45	 But as the man
MRK.2.1	 Now
MRK.2.2	 So many gathered that there was no longer any room, not even by
MRK.2.3	 Some people
MRK.2.4	 When they were not able to bring him in because of the crowd, they removed the roof
MRK.2.5	 When Jesus saw their
MRK.2.6	 Now some of the experts in the law
MRK.2.7	 “Why does this man speak this way? He is blaspheming!
MRK.2.8	 Now
MRK.2.9	 Which is easier,
MRK.2.10	 But so that you may know
MRK.2.11	 “I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher, and go home.”
MRK.2.12	 And immediately the man
MRK.2.13	 Jesus
MRK.2.14	 As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth.
MRK.2.15	 As Jesus
MRK.2.16	 When the experts in the law
MRK.2.17	 When Jesus heard this he said to them, “Those who are healthy don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do.
MRK.2.18	 Now
MRK.2.19	 Jesus
MRK.2.20	 But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken from them,
MRK.2.21	 No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and the tear becomes worse. 
MRK.2.22	 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins;
MRK.2.23	 Jesus
MRK.2.24	 So
MRK.2.25	 He said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions were hungry – 
MRK.2.26	 how he entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest
MRK.2.27	 Then
MRK.2.28	 For this reason the Son of Man is lord
MRK.3.1	 Then
MRK.3.2	 They watched
MRK.3.3	 So he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Stand up among all these people.”
MRK.3.4	 Then
MRK.3.5	 After looking around
MRK.3.6	 So
MRK.3.7	 Then
MRK.3.8	 Jerusalem,
MRK.3.9	 Because of the crowd, he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so the crowd
MRK.3.10	 For he had healed many, so that all who were afflicted with diseases pressed toward him in order to touch him. 
MRK.3.11	 And whenever the unclean spirits
MRK.3.12	 But
MRK.3.13	 Now
MRK.3.14	 He
MRK.3.15	 and to have authority to cast out demons. 
MRK.3.16	 He appointed twelve:
MRK.3.17	 to James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee,
MRK.3.18	 and Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew,
MRK.3.19	 and Judas Iscariot,
MRK.3.20	 Now
MRK.3.21	 When his family
MRK.3.22	 The experts in the law
MRK.3.23	 So
MRK.3.24	 If
MRK.3.25	 If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 
MRK.3.26	 And if Satan rises against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand and his end has come. 
MRK.3.27	 But no one is able to enter a strong man’s
MRK.3.28	 I tell you the truth,
MRK.3.29	 But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, but is guilty of an eternal sin”
MRK.3.30	 (because they said, “He has an unclean spirit”
MRK.3.31	 Then
MRK.3.32	 A crowd was sitting around him and they said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers
MRK.3.33	 He answered them and said, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”
MRK.3.34	 And looking at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Here
MRK.3.35	 For whoever does the will of God is
MRK.4.1	 Again he began to teach by the lake. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there while
MRK.4.2	 He taught them many things in parables,
MRK.4.3	 “Listen! A sower went out to sow.
MRK.4.4	 And as he sowed, some seed
MRK.4.5	 Other seed fell on rocky ground
MRK.4.6	 When the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have sufficient root,
MRK.4.7	 Other seed fell among the thorns,
MRK.4.8	 But
MRK.4.9	 And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear had better listen!”
MRK.4.10	 When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. 
MRK.4.11	 He said to them, “The secret
MRK.4.12	 so that 
MRK.4.12	”
MRK.4.13	 He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? Then
MRK.4.14	 The sower sows the word. 
MRK.4.15	 These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: Whenever they hear, immediately Satan
MRK.4.16	 These are the ones sown on rocky ground: As soon as they hear the word, they receive it with joy. 
MRK.4.17	 But
MRK.4.18	 Others are the ones sown among thorns: They are those who hear the word, 
MRK.4.19	 but
MRK.4.20	 But
MRK.4.21	 He also said to them, “A lamp
MRK.4.22	 For nothing is hidden except to be revealed,
MRK.4.23	 If anyone has ears to hear, he had better listen!”
MRK.4.24	 And he said to them, “Take care about what you hear. The measure you use will be the measure you receive,
MRK.4.25	 For whoever has will be given more, but
MRK.4.26	 He also said, “The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground. 
MRK.4.27	 He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. 
MRK.4.28	 By itself the soil produces a crop, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. 
MRK.4.29	 And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle
MRK.4.30	 He also asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to present it? 
MRK.4.31	 It is like a mustard seed
MRK.4.32	 when it is sown, it grows up,
MRK.4.33	 So
MRK.4.34	 He did not speak to them without a parable. But privately he explained everything to his own disciples.
MRK.4.35	 On that day, when evening came, Jesus
MRK.4.36	 So
MRK.4.37	 Now
MRK.4.38	 But
MRK.4.39	 So
MRK.4.40	 And he said to them, “Why are you cowardly? Do you still not have faith?” 
MRK.4.41	 They were overwhelmed by fear and said to one another, “Who then is this?
MRK.5.1	 So
MRK.5.2	 Just as Jesus
MRK.5.3	 He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. 
MRK.5.4	 For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles,
MRK.5.5	 Each night and every day among the tombs and in the mountains, he would cry out and cut himself with stones. 
MRK.5.6	 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him. 
MRK.5.7	 Then
MRK.5.8	 (For Jesus
MRK.5.9	 Jesus
MRK.5.10	 He begged Jesus
MRK.5.11	 There on the hillside,
MRK.5.12	 And the demonic spirits
MRK.5.13	 Jesus
MRK.5.14	 Now
MRK.5.15	 They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind – the one who had the “Legion” – and they were afraid. 
MRK.5.16	 Those who had seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man reported it, and they also told about the pigs. 
MRK.5.17	 Then
MRK.5.18	 As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go
MRK.5.19	 But
MRK.5.20	 So
MRK.5.21	 When Jesus had crossed again in a boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea. 
MRK.5.22	 Then
MRK.5.23	 He asked him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.” 
MRK.5.24	 Jesus
MRK.5.25	 Now
MRK.5.26	 She had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse. 
MRK.5.27	 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,
MRK.5.28	 for she kept saying,
MRK.5.29	 At once the bleeding stopped,
MRK.5.30	 Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?” 
MRK.5.31	 His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, ‘Who touched me?’” 
MRK.5.32	 But
MRK.5.33	 Then the woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. 
MRK.5.34	 He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well.
MRK.5.35	 While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s
MRK.5.36	 But Jesus, paying no attention to what was said, told the synagogue ruler, “Do not be afraid; just believe.” 
MRK.5.37	 He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James,
MRK.5.38	 They came to the house of the synagogue ruler where
MRK.5.39	 When he entered he said to them, “Why are you distressed and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep.” 
MRK.5.40	 And they began making fun of him.
MRK.5.41	 Then, gently taking the child by the hand, he said to her, “
MRK.5.42	 The girl got up at once and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). They were completely astonished at this.
MRK.5.43	 He strictly ordered that no one should know about this,
MRK.6.1	 Now
MRK.6.2	 When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue.
MRK.6.3	 Isn’t this the carpenter, the son
MRK.6.4	 Then
MRK.6.5	 He was not able to do a miracle there, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. 
MRK.6.6	 And he was amazed because of their unbelief. Then
MRK.6.7	 Jesus
MRK.6.8	 He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff
MRK.6.9	 and to put on sandals but not to wear two tunics.
MRK.6.10	 He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there
MRK.6.11	 If a place will not welcome you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off
MRK.6.12	 So
MRK.6.13	 They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.
MRK.6.14	 Now
MRK.6.15	 Others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets from the past.” 
MRK.6.16	 But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!” 
MRK.6.17	 For Herod himself had sent men, arrested John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because Herod
MRK.6.18	 For John had repeatedly told
MRK.6.19	 So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But
MRK.6.20	 because Herod stood in awe of
MRK.6.21	 But
MRK.6.22	 When his daughter Herodias
MRK.6.23	 He swore to her,
MRK.6.24	 So
MRK.6.25	 Immediately she hurried back to the king and made her request:
MRK.6.26	 Although it grieved the king deeply,
MRK.6.27	 So
MRK.6.28	 He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	 When John’s
MRK.6.30	 Then
MRK.6.31	 He said to them, “Come with me privately to an isolated place and rest a while” (for many were coming and going, and there was no time to eat). 
MRK.6.32	 So they went away by themselves in a boat to some remote place. 
MRK.6.33	 But many saw them leaving and recognized them, and they hurried on foot
MRK.6.34	 As Jesus
MRK.6.35	 When it was already late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is an isolated place
MRK.6.36	 Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy something for themselves to eat.” 
MRK.6.37	 But he answered them,
MRK.6.38	 He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” When they found out, they said, “Five – and two fish.” 
MRK.6.39	 Then he directed them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	 So they reclined in groups of hundreds and fifties. 
MRK.6.41	 He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He
MRK.6.42	 They all ate and were satisfied, 
MRK.6.43	 and they picked up the broken pieces and fish that were left over, twelve baskets full. 
MRK.6.44	 Now
MRK.6.45	 Immediately Jesus
MRK.6.46	 After saying good-bye to them, he went to the mountain to pray. 
MRK.6.47	 When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land. 
MRK.6.48	 He
MRK.6.49	 When they saw him walking on the water
MRK.6.50	 for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them:
MRK.6.51	 Then he went up with them into the boat, and the wind ceased. They were completely astonished, 
MRK.6.52	 because they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
MRK.6.53	 After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret
MRK.6.54	 As they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized Jesus.
MRK.6.55	 They ran through that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever he was rumored to be.
MRK.6.56	 And wherever he would go – into villages, towns, or countryside – they would place the sick in the marketplaces, and would ask him if
MRK.7.1	 Now
MRK.7.2	 And they saw that some of Jesus’ disciples ate their bread with unclean hands, that is, unwashed. 
MRK.7.3	 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing,
MRK.7.4	 And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. They hold fast to many other traditions: the washing of cups, pots, kettles, and dining couches.
MRK.7.5	 The Pharisees and the experts in the law asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat
MRK.7.6	 He said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written:
MRK.7.6	‘
MRK.7.7	’
MRK.7.8	 Having no regard
MRK.7.9	 He also said to them, “You neatly reject the commandment of God in order to set up
MRK.7.10	 For Moses said, ‘
MRK.7.11	 But you say that if anyone tells his father or mother, ‘Whatever help you would have received from me is 
MRK.7.12	 then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother. 
MRK.7.13	 Thus you nullify
MRK.7.14	 Then
MRK.7.15	 There is nothing outside of a person that can defile him by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles him.”
MRK.7.17	 Now
MRK.7.18	 He said to them, “Are you so foolish? Don’t you understand that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him? 
MRK.7.19	 For it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and then goes out into the sewer.”
MRK.7.20	 He said, “What comes out of a person defiles him. 
MRK.7.21	 For from within, out of the human heart, come evil ideas, sexual immorality, theft, murder, 
MRK.7.22	 adultery, greed, evil, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, pride, and folly. 
MRK.7.23	 All these evils come from within and defile a person.”
MRK.7.24	 After Jesus
MRK.7.25	 Instead, a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit
MRK.7.26	 The woman was a Greek, of Syrophoenician origin. She
MRK.7.27	 He said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and to throw it to the dogs.”
MRK.7.28	 She answered, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” 
MRK.7.29	 Then
MRK.7.30	 She went home and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
MRK.7.31	 Then
MRK.7.32	 They brought to him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking, and they asked him to place his hands on him. 
MRK.7.33	 After Jesus
MRK.7.34	 Then
MRK.7.35	 And immediately the man’s
MRK.7.36	 Jesus ordered them not to tell anything. But as much as he ordered them not to do this, they proclaimed it all the more.
MRK.7.37	 People were completely astounded and said, “He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
MRK.8.1	 In those days there was another large crowd with nothing to eat. So
MRK.8.2	 “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days, and they have nothing to eat. 
MRK.8.3	 If I send them home hungry, they will faint on the way, and some of them have come from a great distance.” 
MRK.8.4	 His disciples answered him, “Where can someone get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy these people?” 
MRK.8.5	 He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven.” 
MRK.8.6	 Then
MRK.8.7	 They also had a few small fish. After giving thanks for these, he told them to serve these as well. 
MRK.8.8	 Everyone
MRK.8.9	 There were about four thousand
MRK.8.10	 Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	 Then the Pharisees
MRK.8.12	 Sighing deeply in his spirit he said, “Why does this generation look for a sign? I tell you the truth,
MRK.8.13	 Then
MRK.8.14	 Now
MRK.8.15	 And Jesus
MRK.8.16	 So they began to discuss with one another about having no bread.
MRK.8.17	 When he learned of this,
MRK.8.18	 Though you have eyes, don’t you see? And though you have ears, can’t you hear?
MRK.8.19	 When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They replied, “Twelve.” 
MRK.8.20	 “When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They replied,
MRK.8.21	 Then
MRK.8.22	 Then
MRK.8.23	 He took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside of the village. Then
MRK.8.24	 Regaining his sight
MRK.8.25	 Then Jesus
MRK.8.26	 Jesus
MRK.8.27	 Then Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi.
MRK.8.28	 They said,
MRK.8.29	 He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him,
MRK.8.30	 Then
MRK.8.31	 Then
MRK.8.32	 He spoke openly about this. So
MRK.8.33	 But after turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan. You are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.”
MRK.8.34	 Then
MRK.8.35	 For whoever wants to save his life
MRK.8.36	 For what benefit is it for a person
MRK.8.37	 What can a person give in exchange for his life? 
MRK.8.38	 For if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him
MRK.9.1	 And he said to them, “I tell you the truth,
MRK.9.2	 Six days later
MRK.9.3	 and his clothes became radiantly white, more so than any launderer in the world could bleach them. 
MRK.9.4	 Then Elijah appeared before them along with Moses,
MRK.9.5	 So
MRK.9.6	 (For they were afraid, and he did not know what to say.)
MRK.9.7	 Then
MRK.9.8	 Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more except Jesus.
MRK.9.9	 As they were coming down from the mountain, he gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 
MRK.9.10	 They kept this statement to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead meant. 
MRK.9.11	 Then
MRK.9.12	 He said to them, “Elijah does indeed come first, and restores all things. And why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be despised? 
MRK.9.13	 But I tell you that Elijah has certainly come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.”
MRK.9.14	 When they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and experts in the law
MRK.9.15	 When the whole crowd saw him, they were amazed and ran
MRK.9.16	 He asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?” 
MRK.9.17	 A member of the crowd said to him, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that makes him mute. 
MRK.9.18	 Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but
MRK.9.19	 He answered them,
MRK.9.20	 So they brought the boy
MRK.9.21	 Jesus
MRK.9.22	 It has often thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” 
MRK.9.23	 Then Jesus said to him, “‘If you are able?’
MRK.9.24	 Immediately the father of the boy cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!”
MRK.9.25	 Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he rebuked
MRK.9.26	 It shrieked, threw him into terrible convulsions, and came out. The boy
MRK.9.27	 But Jesus gently took his hand and raised him to his feet, and he stood up.
MRK.9.28	 Then,
MRK.9.29	 He told them, “This kind can come out only by prayer.”
MRK.9.30	 They went out from there and passed through Galilee. But
MRK.9.31	 for he was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men.
MRK.9.32	 But they did not understand this statement and were afraid to ask him.
MRK.9.33	 Then
MRK.9.34	 But they were silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest. 
MRK.9.35	 After he sat down, he called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.” 
MRK.9.36	 He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them, 
MRK.9.37	 “Whoever welcomes
MRK.9.38	 John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he was not following us.” 
MRK.9.39	 But Jesus said, “Do not stop him, because no one who does a miracle in my name will be able soon afterward to say anything bad about me. 
MRK.9.40	 For whoever is not against us is for us. 
MRK.9.41	 For I tell you the truth,
MRK.9.42	 “If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a huge millstone
MRK.9.43	 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than to have
MRK.9.45	 If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better to enter life lame than to have
MRK.9.47	 If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out!
MRK.9.48	 where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. 
MRK.9.49	 Everyone will be salted with fire.
MRK.9.50	 Salt
MRK.10.1	 Then
MRK.10.2	 Then some Pharisees
MRK.10.3	 He answered them,
MRK.10.4	 They said, “Moses permitted a man 
MRK.10.5	 But Jesus said to them, “He wrote this commandment for you because of your hard hearts.
MRK.10.6	 But from the beginning of creation 
MRK.10.9	 Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”
MRK.10.10	 In the house once again, the disciples asked him about this. 
MRK.10.11	 So
MRK.10.12	 And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”
MRK.10.13	 Now
MRK.10.14	 But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
MRK.10.15	 I tell you the truth,
MRK.10.16	 After he took the children in his arms, he placed his hands on them and blessed them.
MRK.10.17	 Now
MRK.10.18	 Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good?
MRK.10.19	 You know the commandments: ‘
MRK.10.20	 The man
MRK.10.21	 As Jesus looked at him, he felt love for him and said, “You lack one thing. Go, sell whatever you have and give the money
MRK.10.22	 But at this statement, the man
MRK.10.23	 Then
MRK.10.24	 The disciples were astonished at these words. But again Jesus said to them,
MRK.10.25	 It is easier for a camel
MRK.10.26	 They were even more astonished and said
MRK.10.27	 Jesus looked at them and replied, “This is impossible for mere humans,
MRK.10.28	 Peter began to speak to him, “Look,
MRK.10.29	 Jesus said, “I tell you the truth,
MRK.10.30	 who will not receive in this age
MRK.10.31	 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”
MRK.10.32	 They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem.
MRK.10.33	 “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and experts in the law.
MRK.10.34	 They will mock him, spit on him, flog
MRK.10.35	 Then
MRK.10.36	 He said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?” 
MRK.10.37	 They said to him, “Permit one of us to sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your glory.” 
MRK.10.38	 But Jesus said to them, “You don’t know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I experience?”
MRK.10.39	 They said to him, “We are able.”
MRK.10.40	 but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give. It is for those for whom it has been prepared.”
MRK.10.41	 Now
MRK.10.42	 Jesus called them and said to them, “You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions use their authority over them. 
MRK.10.43	 But it is not this way among you. Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant, 
MRK.10.44	 and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave
MRK.10.45	 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom
MRK.10.46	 They came to Jericho.
MRK.10.47	 When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to shout,
MRK.10.48	 Many scolded
MRK.10.49	 Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So
MRK.10.50	 He threw off his cloak, jumped up, and came to Jesus. 
MRK.10.51	 Then
MRK.10.52	 Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has healed you.” Immediately he regained
MRK.11.1	 Now
MRK.11.2	 and said to them, “Go to the village ahead of you.
MRK.11.3	 If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it
MRK.11.4	 So
MRK.11.5	 Some people standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying that colt?” 
MRK.11.6	 They replied as Jesus had told them, and the bystanders
MRK.11.7	 Then
MRK.11.8	 Many spread their cloaks on the road and others spread branches they had cut in the fields. 
MRK.11.9	 Both those who went ahead and those who followed kept shouting, “
MRK.11.10	 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!” 
MRK.11.11	 Then
MRK.11.12	 Now
MRK.11.13	 After noticing in the distance a fig tree with leaves, he went to see if he could find any fruit
MRK.11.14	 He said to it,
MRK.11.15	 Then
MRK.11.16	 and he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise
MRK.11.17	 Then he began to teach
MRK.11.18	 The chief priests and the experts in the law
MRK.11.19	 When evening came, Jesus and his disciples
MRK.11.20	 In the morning as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. 
MRK.11.21	 Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered.” 
MRK.11.22	 Jesus said to them, “Have faith in God. 
MRK.11.23	 I tell you the truth,
MRK.11.24	 For this reason I tell you, whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. 
MRK.11.25	 Whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven will
MRK.11.27	 They came again to Jerusalem.
MRK.11.28	 and said, “By what authority
MRK.11.29	 Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things: 
MRK.11.30	 John’s baptism – was it from heaven or from people?
MRK.11.31	 They discussed with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’ 
MRK.11.32	 But if we say, ‘From people – ’” (they feared the crowd, for they all considered John to be truly a prophet). 
MRK.11.33	 So
MRK.12.1	 Then
MRK.12.2	 At harvest time he sent a slave
MRK.12.3	 But
MRK.12.4	 So
MRK.12.5	 He sent another, and that one they killed. This happened to many others, some of whom were beaten, others killed. 
MRK.12.6	 He had one left, his one dear son.
MRK.12.7	 But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and the inheritance will be ours!’ 
MRK.12.8	 So
MRK.12.9	 What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy
MRK.12.10	 Have you not read this scripture:
MRK.12.10	‘
MRK.12.12	 Now
MRK.12.13	 Then
MRK.12.14	 When they came they said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and do not court anyone’s favor, because you show no partiality
MRK.12.15	 But he saw through their hypocrisy and said
MRK.12.16	 So
MRK.12.17	 Then Jesus said to them, “Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”
MRK.12.18	 Sadducees
MRK.12.19	 “Teacher, Moses wrote for us: ‘
MRK.12.20	 There were seven brothers. The first one married,
MRK.12.21	 The second married her and died without any children, and likewise the third. 
MRK.12.22	 None of the seven had children. Finally, the woman died too. 
MRK.12.23	 In the resurrection, when they rise again,
MRK.12.24	 Jesus said to them, “Aren’t you deceived
MRK.12.25	 For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels
MRK.12.26	 Now as for the dead being raised,
MRK.12.27	 He is not the God of the dead but of the living.
MRK.12.28	 Now
MRK.12.29	 Jesus answered, “The most important is: ‘
MRK.12.31	 The second is: ‘
MRK.12.32	 The expert in the law said to him, “That is true, Teacher; you are right to say that 
MRK.12.33	 And 
MRK.12.34	 When Jesus saw that he had answered thoughtfully, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” Then no one dared any longer to question him.
MRK.12.35	 While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he said, “How is it that the experts in the law
MRK.12.36	 David himself, by the Holy Spirit, said,
MRK.12.36	‘
MRK.12.36	“
MRK.12.36	”’
MRK.12.37	 If David himself calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”
MRK.12.38	 In his teaching Jesus
MRK.12.39	 and the best seats in the synagogues
MRK.12.40	 They
MRK.12.41	 Then
MRK.12.42	 And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins,
MRK.12.43	 He called his disciples and said to them, “I tell you the truth,
MRK.12.44	 For they all gave out of their wealth.
MRK.13.1	 Now
MRK.13.2	 Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left on another.
MRK.13.3	 So
MRK.13.4	 “Tell us, when will these things
MRK.13.5	 Jesus began to say to them, “Watch out
MRK.13.6	 Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’
MRK.13.7	 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is still to come.
MRK.13.8	 For nation will rise up in arms
MRK.13.9	 “You must watch out for yourselves. You will be handed over
MRK.13.10	 First the gospel must be preached to all nations. 
MRK.13.11	 When they arrest you and hand you over for trial, do not worry about what to speak. But say whatever is given you at that time,
MRK.13.12	 Brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise against
MRK.13.13	 You will be hated by everyone because of my name.
MRK.13.14	 “But when you see 
MRK.13.15	 The one on the roof
MRK.13.16	 The one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. 
MRK.13.17	 Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days! 
MRK.13.18	 Pray that it may not be in winter. 
MRK.13.19	 For in those days there will be suffering
MRK.13.20	 And if the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would be saved. But because of the elect, whom he chose, he has cut them
MRK.13.21	 Then
MRK.13.22	 For false messiahs
MRK.13.23	 Be careful! I have told you everything ahead of time.
MRK.13.24	 “But in those days, after that suffering,
MRK.13.26	 Then everyone
MRK.13.27	 Then he will send angels and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.
MRK.13.28	 “Learn this parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. 
MRK.13.29	 So also you, when you see these things happening, know
MRK.13.30	 I tell you the truth,
MRK.13.31	 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
MRK.13.32	 “But as for that day or hour no one knows it – neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son
MRK.13.33	 Watch out! Stay alert!
MRK.13.34	 It is like a man going on a journey. He left his house and put his slaves
MRK.13.35	 Stay alert, then, because you do not know when the owner of the house will return – whether during evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or at dawn – 
MRK.13.36	 or else he might find you asleep when he returns suddenly. 
MRK.13.37	 What I say to you I say to everyone: Stay alert!”
MRK.14.1	 Two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the chief priests and the experts in the law
MRK.14.2	 For they said, “Not during the feast, so there won’t be a riot among the people.”
MRK.14.3	 Now
MRK.14.4	 But some who were present indignantly said to one another, “Why this waste of expensive
MRK.14.5	 It
MRK.14.6	 But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a good service for me. 
MRK.14.7	 For you will always have the poor with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want. But you will not always have me!
MRK.14.8	 She did what she could. She anointed my body beforehand for burial. 
MRK.14.9	 I tell you the truth,
MRK.14.10	 Then
MRK.14.11	 When they heard this, they were delighted
MRK.14.12	 Now
MRK.14.13	 He sent two of his disciples and told them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar
MRK.14.14	 Wherever he enters, tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ 
MRK.14.15	 He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.” 
MRK.14.16	 So
MRK.14.17	 Then,
MRK.14.18	 While they were at the table
MRK.14.19	 They were distressed, and one by one said to him, “Surely not I?” 
MRK.14.20	 He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who dips his hand
MRK.14.21	 For the Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had never been born.”
MRK.14.22	 While they were eating, he took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it, gave it to them, and said, “Take it. This is my body.” 
MRK.14.23	 And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. 
MRK.14.24	 He said to them, “This is my blood, the blood
MRK.14.25	 I tell you the truth,
MRK.14.26	 After singing a hymn,
MRK.14.27	 Then
MRK.14.27	‘
MRK.14.27	’
MRK.14.28	 But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” 
MRK.14.29	 Peter said to him, “Even if they all fall away, I will not!” 
MRK.14.30	 Jesus said to him, “I tell you the truth,
MRK.14.31	 But Peter
MRK.14.32	 Then
MRK.14.33	 He took Peter, James,
MRK.14.34	 He said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay alert.” 
MRK.14.35	 Going a little farther, he threw himself to the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour would pass from him. 
MRK.14.36	 He said, “Abba,
MRK.14.37	 Then
MRK.14.38	 Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.” 
MRK.14.39	 He went away again and prayed the same thing. 
MRK.14.40	 When he came again he found them sleeping; they could not keep their eyes open.
MRK.14.41	 He came a third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting?
MRK.14.42	 Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer
MRK.14.43	 Right away, while Jesus
MRK.14.44	 (Now the betrayer
MRK.14.45	 When Judas
MRK.14.46	 Then they took hold of him
MRK.14.47	 One of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the high priest’s slave,
MRK.14.48	 Jesus said to them, “Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw?
MRK.14.49	 Day after day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, yet
MRK.14.50	 Then
MRK.14.51	 A young man was following him, wearing only a linen cloth. They tried to arrest him, 
MRK.14.52	 but he ran off naked,
MRK.14.53	 Then
MRK.14.54	 And Peter had followed him from a distance, up to the high priest’s courtyard. He
MRK.14.55	 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find anything. 
MRK.14.56	 Many gave false testimony against him, but their testimony did not agree. 
MRK.14.57	 Some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:
MRK.14.58	 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands and in three days build another not made with hands.’” 
MRK.14.59	 Yet even on this point their testimony did not agree. 
MRK.14.60	 Then
MRK.14.61	 But he was silent and did not answer. Again the high priest questioned him,
MRK.14.62	 “I am,” said Jesus, “and you will see 
MRK.14.63	 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses? 
MRK.14.64	 You have heard the blasphemy! What is your verdict?”
MRK.14.65	 Then
MRK.14.66	 Now
MRK.14.67	 When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked directly at him and said, “You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus.” 
MRK.14.68	 But he denied it:
MRK.14.69	 When the slave girl saw him, she began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.” 
MRK.14.70	 But he denied it again. A short time later the bystanders again said to Peter, “You must be
MRK.14.71	 Then he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, “I do not know this man you are talking about!” 
MRK.14.72	 Immediately a rooster
MRK.15.1	 Early in the morning, after forming a plan, the chief priests with the elders and the experts in the law
MRK.15.2	 So
MRK.15.3	 Then
MRK.15.4	 So Pilate asked him again,
MRK.15.5	 But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed. 
MRK.15.6	 During the feast it was customary to release one prisoner to the people,
MRK.15.7	 A man named Barabbas was imprisoned with rebels who had committed murder during an insurrection. 
MRK.15.8	 Then the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to release a prisoner for them, as was his custom.
MRK.15.9	 So Pilate asked them,
MRK.15.10	 (For he knew that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.)
MRK.15.11	 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release
MRK.15.12	 So Pilate spoke to them again,
MRK.15.13	 They shouted back, “Crucify
MRK.15.14	 Pilate asked them, “Why? What has he done wrong?” But they shouted more insistently, “Crucify him!” 
MRK.15.15	 Because he wanted to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them. Then,
MRK.15.16	 So
MRK.15.17	 They put a purple cloak
MRK.15.18	 They began to salute him: “Hail, king of the Jews!”
MRK.15.19	 Again and again
MRK.15.20	 When they had finished mocking
MRK.15.21	 The soldiers
MRK.15.22	 They brought Jesus
MRK.15.23	 They offered him wine mixed with myrrh,
MRK.15.24	 Then
MRK.15.25	 It was nine o’clock in the morning
MRK.15.26	 The inscription
MRK.15.27	 And they crucified two outlaws with him, one on his right and one on his left.
MRK.15.29	 Those who passed by defamed him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 
MRK.15.30	 save yourself and come down from the cross!”
MRK.15.31	 In the same way even the chief priests – together with the experts in the law
MRK.15.32	 Let the Christ,
MRK.15.33	 Now
MRK.15.34	 Around three o’clock
MRK.15.35	 When some of the bystanders heard it they said, “Listen, he is calling for Elijah!”
MRK.15.36	 Then someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine,
MRK.15.37	 But Jesus cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last. 
MRK.15.38	 And the temple curtain
MRK.15.39	 Now when the centurion,
MRK.15.40	 There were also women, watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses,
MRK.15.41	 When he was in Galilee, they had followed him and given him support.
MRK.15.42	 Now
MRK.15.43	 Joseph of Arimathea, a highly regarded member of the council,
MRK.15.44	 Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. He
MRK.15.45	 When Pilate
MRK.15.46	 After Joseph
MRK.15.47	 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body
MRK.16.1	 When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought aromatic spices
MRK.16.2	 And very early on the first day of the week, at sunrise, they went to the tomb. 
MRK.16.3	 They had been asking each other, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?” 
MRK.16.4	 But
MRK.16.5	 Then
MRK.16.6	 But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified.
MRK.16.7	 But go, tell his disciples, even Peter, that he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.” 
MRK.16.8	 Then
MRK.16.8	[[ 
MRK.16.9	 Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons. 
MRK.16.10	 She went out and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. 
MRK.16.11	 And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.
MRK.16.12	 After this he appeared in a different form to two of them while they were on their way to the country. 
MRK.16.13	 They went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them. 
MRK.16.14	 Then he appeared to the eleven themselves, while they were eating, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him resurrected. 
MRK.16.15	 He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. 
MRK.16.16	 The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who does not believe will be condemned. 
MRK.16.17	 These signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;
MRK.16.18	 they will pick up snakes with their hands, and whatever poison they drink will not harm them;
MRK.16.19	 After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. 
MRK.16.20	 They went out and proclaimed everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through the accompanying signs.]]

LUK.2.22	 Now
LUK.2.23	 (just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “
LUK.2.24	 and to offer a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord, 
LUK.2.25	 Now
LUK.2.26	 It
LUK.2.27	 So
LUK.2.28	 Simeon
LUK.2.29	 “Now, according to your word,
LUK.2.30	 For my eyes have seen your salvation
LUK.2.31	 that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples:
LUK.2.32	 a light,
LUK.2.32	for revelation to the Gentiles, 
LUK.2.32	and for glory
LUK.2.33	 So
LUK.2.34	 Then
LUK.2.35	 Indeed, as a result of him the thoughts
LUK.2.36	 There was also a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old,
LUK.2.37	 She had lived as a widow since then for eighty-four years.
LUK.2.38	 At that moment,
LUK.2.39	 So
LUK.2.40	 And the child grew and became strong,
LUK.2.41	 Now
LUK.2.42	 When
LUK.2.43	 But
LUK.2.44	 but (because they assumed that he was in their group of travelers)
LUK.2.45	 When
LUK.2.46	 After
LUK.2.47	 And all who heard Jesus
LUK.2.48	 When
LUK.2.49	 But
LUK.2.50	 Yet
LUK.2.51	 Then
LUK.2.52	 And Jesus increased
LUK.3.1	 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
LUK.3.2	 during the high priesthood
LUK.3.3	 He
LUK.3.4	 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, 
LUK.3.7	 So John
LUK.3.8	 Therefore produce
LUK.3.9	 Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees,
LUK.3.10	 So
LUK.3.11	 John
LUK.3.12	 Tax collectors
LUK.3.13	 He told them, “Collect no more
LUK.3.14	 Then some soldiers
LUK.3.15	 While the people were filled with anticipation
LUK.3.16	 John answered them all,
LUK.3.17	 His winnowing fork
LUK.3.18	 And in this way,
LUK.3.19	 But when John rebuked Herod
LUK.3.20	 Herod added this to them all: He locked up John in prison.
LUK.3.21	 Now when
LUK.3.22	 and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove.
LUK.3.23	 So
LUK.3.24	 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 
LUK.3.25	 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, 
LUK.3.26	 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 
LUK.3.27	 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel,
LUK.3.28	 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 
LUK.3.29	 the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 
LUK.3.30	 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 
LUK.3.31	 the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan,
LUK.3.32	 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala,
LUK.3.33	 the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni,
LUK.3.34	 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah,
LUK.3.35	 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, 
LUK.3.36	 the son of Cainan,
LUK.3.37	 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel,
LUK.3.38	 the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
LUK.4.1	 Then
LUK.4.2	 where for forty days he endured temptations
LUK.4.3	 The devil said to him, “If
LUK.4.4	 Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘
LUK.4.5	 Then
LUK.4.6	 And he
LUK.4.7	 So then, if
LUK.4.8	 Jesus
LUK.4.9	 Then
LUK.4.10	 for it is written, ‘
LUK.4.11	 and ‘
LUK.4.12	 Jesus
LUK.4.13	 So
LUK.4.14	 Then
LUK.4.15	 He
LUK.4.16	 Now
LUK.4.17	 and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He
LUK.4.18	 “
LUK.4.20	 Then
LUK.4.21	 Then
LUK.4.22	 All
LUK.4.23	 Jesus
LUK.4.24	 And he added,
LUK.4.25	 But in truth I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s days,
LUK.4.26	 Yet
LUK.4.27	 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha,
LUK.4.28	 When they heard this, all the people
LUK.4.29	 They got up, forced
LUK.4.30	 But he passed through the crowd
LUK.4.31	 So
LUK.4.32	 They
LUK.4.33	 Now
LUK.4.34	 “Ha! Leave us alone,
LUK.4.35	 But
LUK.4.36	 They
LUK.4.37	 So
LUK.4.38	 After Jesus left
LUK.4.39	 So
LUK.4.40	 As the sun was setting, all those who had any relatives
LUK.4.41	 Demons also came out
LUK.4.42	 The next morning
LUK.4.43	 But Jesus
LUK.4.44	 So
LUK.5.1	 Now
LUK.5.2	 He
LUK.5.3	 He got into
LUK.5.4	 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and lower
LUK.5.5	 Simon
LUK.5.6	 When
LUK.5.7	 So
LUK.5.8	 But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Go away from me, Lord,
LUK.5.9	 For
LUK.5.10	 and so were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s business partners.
LUK.5.11	 So
LUK.5.12	 While
LUK.5.13	 So
LUK.5.14	 Then
LUK.5.15	 But the news about him spread even more,
LUK.5.16	 Yet Jesus himself
LUK.5.17	 Now on
LUK.5.18	 Just then
LUK.5.19	 But
LUK.5.20	 When
LUK.5.21	 Then
LUK.5.22	 When Jesus perceived
LUK.5.23	 Which is easier,
LUK.5.24	 But so that you may know
LUK.5.25	 Immediately
LUK.5.26	 Then
LUK.5.27	 After
LUK.5.28	 And he got up and followed him, leaving everything
LUK.5.29	 Then
LUK.5.30	 But
LUK.5.31	 Jesus
LUK.5.32	 I have not come
LUK.5.33	 Then
LUK.5.34	 So
LUK.5.35	 But those days are coming, and when the bridegroom is taken from them,
LUK.5.36	 He also told them a parable:
LUK.5.37	 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins.
LUK.5.38	 Instead new wine must be poured into new wineskins.
LUK.5.39	 No
LUK.6.1	 Jesus
LUK.6.2	 But some of the Pharisees
LUK.6.3	 Jesus
LUK.6.4	 how he entered the house of God, took
LUK.6.5	 Then
LUK.6.6	 On
LUK.6.7	 The experts in the law
LUK.6.8	 But
LUK.6.9	 Then
LUK.6.10	 After
LUK.6.11	 But they were filled with mindless rage
LUK.6.12	 Now
LUK.6.13	 When
LUK.6.14	 Simon
LUK.6.15	 Matthew, Thomas,
LUK.6.16	 Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot,
LUK.6.17	 Then
LUK.6.18	 and those who suffered from
LUK.6.19	 The
LUK.6.20	 Then
LUK.6.20	“Blessed
LUK.6.21	 “Blessed are you who hunger
LUK.6.21	“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
LUK.6.22	 “Blessed are you when people
LUK.6.23	 Rejoice in that day, and jump for joy, because
LUK.6.24	 “But woe
LUK.6.25	 “Woe to you who are well satisfied with food
LUK.6.25	“Woe to you
LUK.6.26	 “Woe to you
LUK.6.27	 “But I say to you who are listening: Love your enemies,
LUK.6.28	 bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat
LUK.6.29	 To the person who strikes you on the cheek,
LUK.6.30	 Give to everyone who asks you,
LUK.6.31	 Treat others
LUK.6.32	 “If
LUK.6.33	 And
LUK.6.34	 And if you lend to those from whom you hope to be repaid,
LUK.6.35	 But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back.
LUK.6.36	 Be merciful,
LUK.6.37	 “Do
LUK.6.38	 Give, and it will be given to you: A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over,
LUK.6.39	 He also told them a parable: “Someone who is blind cannot lead another who is blind, can he?
LUK.6.40	 A disciple
LUK.6.41	 Why
LUK.6.42	 How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck from your eye,’ while you yourself don’t see the beam in your own? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
LUK.6.43	 “For
LUK.6.44	 for each tree is known
LUK.6.45	 The good person out of the good treasury of his
LUK.6.46	 “Why
LUK.6.47	 “Everyone who comes to me and listens to my words and puts them into practice
LUK.6.48	 He is like a man
LUK.6.49	 But the person who hears and does not put my words into practice
LUK.7.1	 After Jesus
LUK.7.2	 A centurion
LUK.7.3	 When the centurion
LUK.7.4	 When
LUK.7.5	 because he loves our nation,
LUK.7.6	 So
LUK.7.7	 That is why
LUK.7.8	 For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me.
LUK.7.9	 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed
LUK.7.10	 So
LUK.7.11	 Soon
LUK.7.12	 As he approached the town gate, a man
LUK.7.13	 When
LUK.7.14	 Then
LUK.7.15	 So
LUK.7.16	 Fear
LUK.7.17	 This
LUK.7.18	 John’s
LUK.7.19	 and sent them to Jesus
LUK.7.20	 When
LUK.7.21	 At that very time
LUK.7.22	 So
LUK.7.23	 Blessed is anyone
LUK.7.24	 When
LUK.7.25	 What
LUK.7.26	 What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more
LUK.7.27	 This is the one about whom it is written, ‘
LUK.7.28	 I tell you, among those born of women no one is greater
LUK.7.29	 (Now
LUK.7.30	 However, the Pharisees
LUK.7.31	 “To what then should I compare the people
LUK.7.32	 They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another,
LUK.7.32	‘We played the flute for you, yet you did not dance;
LUK.7.32	we wailed in mourning,
LUK.7.33	 For John the Baptist has come
LUK.7.34	 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him,
LUK.7.35	 But wisdom is vindicated
LUK.7.36	 Now one of the Pharisees
LUK.7.37	 Then
LUK.7.38	 As
LUK.7.39	 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this,
LUK.7.40	 So
LUK.7.41	 “A certain creditor
LUK.7.42	 When they could not pay, he canceled
LUK.7.43	 Simon answered,
LUK.7.44	 Then,
LUK.7.45	 You gave me no kiss of greeting,
LUK.7.46	 You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet
LUK.7.47	 Therefore I tell you, her sins, which were many, are forgiven, thus she loved much;
LUK.7.48	 Then
LUK.7.49	 But
LUK.7.50	 He
LUK.8.1	 Some time
LUK.8.2	 and also some women
LUK.8.3	 and Joanna the wife of Cuza
LUK.8.4	 While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus
LUK.8.5	 “A sower went out to sow
LUK.8.6	 Other seed fell on rock,
LUK.8.7	 Other seed fell among the thorns,
LUK.8.8	 But
LUK.8.9	 Then
LUK.8.10	 He
LUK.8.11	 “Now the parable means
LUK.8.12	 Those along the path are the ones who have heard; then the devil
LUK.8.13	 Those
LUK.8.14	 As for the seed that
LUK.8.15	 But as for the seed that landed on good soil, these are the ones who, after hearing
LUK.8.16	 “No one lights
LUK.8.17	 For nothing is hidden
LUK.8.18	 So listen carefully,
LUK.8.19	 Now Jesus’
LUK.8.20	 So
LUK.8.21	 But he replied
LUK.8.22	 One
LUK.8.23	 and as they sailed he fell asleep. Now a violent windstorm
LUK.8.24	 They
LUK.8.25	 Then
LUK.8.26	 So
LUK.8.27	 As
LUK.8.28	 When he saw
LUK.8.29	 For Jesus
LUK.8.30	 Jesus then
LUK.8.31	 And they began to beg
LUK.8.32	 Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside,
LUK.8.33	 So
LUK.8.34	 When
LUK.8.35	 So
LUK.8.36	 Those
LUK.8.37	 Then
LUK.8.38	 The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go
LUK.8.39	 “Return to your home,
LUK.8.40	 Now when Jesus returned,
LUK.8.41	 Then
LUK.8.42	 because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying.
LUK.8.42	As Jesus was on his way, the crowds pressed
LUK.8.43	 Now
LUK.8.44	 She
LUK.8.45	 Then
LUK.8.46	 But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, for I know that power has gone out
LUK.8.47	 When
LUK.8.48	 Then
LUK.8.49	 While he was still speaking, someone from the synagogue ruler’s
LUK.8.50	 But when Jesus heard this, he told
LUK.8.51	 Now when he came to the house, Jesus
LUK.8.52	 Now they were all
LUK.8.53	 And they began making fun
LUK.8.54	 But Jesus
LUK.8.55	 Her
LUK.8.56	 Her
LUK.9.1	 After
LUK.9.2	 and he sent
LUK.9.3	 He
LUK.9.4	 Whatever
LUK.9.5	 Wherever
LUK.9.6	 Then
LUK.9.7	 Now Herod
LUK.9.8	 while others were saying that Elijah
LUK.9.9	 Herod said, “I had John
LUK.9.10	 When
LUK.9.11	 But when the crowds found out, they followed him. He
LUK.9.12	 Now the day began to draw to a close,
LUK.9.13	 But he said to them, “You
LUK.9.14	 (Now about five thousand men
LUK.9.15	 So they did as Jesus directed,
LUK.9.16	 Then
LUK.9.17	 They all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over
LUK.9.18	 Once
LUK.9.19	 They
LUK.9.20	 Then
LUK.9.21	 But he forcefully commanded
LUK.9.22	 saying, “The Son of Man must suffer
LUK.9.23	 Then
LUK.9.24	 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it,
LUK.9.25	 For what does it benefit a person
LUK.9.26	 For whoever is ashamed
LUK.9.27	 But I tell you most certainly,
LUK.9.28	 Now
LUK.9.29	 As
LUK.9.30	 Then
LUK.9.31	 They appeared in glorious splendor and spoke about his departure
LUK.9.32	 Now Peter and those with him were quite sleepy,
LUK.9.33	 Then
LUK.9.34	 As
LUK.9.35	 Then
LUK.9.36	 After
LUK.9.37	 Now on
LUK.9.38	 Then
LUK.9.39	 A
LUK.9.40	 I
LUK.9.41	 Jesus answered,
LUK.9.42	 As
LUK.9.43	 Then
LUK.9.43	But while the entire crowd
LUK.9.44	 “Take these words to heart,
LUK.9.45	 But they did not understand this statement; its meaning
LUK.9.46	 Now an argument started among the disciples
LUK.9.47	 But when Jesus discerned their innermost thoughts,
LUK.9.48	 and said to them, “Whoever welcomes
LUK.9.49	 John answered,
LUK.9.50	 But Jesus said to him, “Do not stop him, for whoever is not against you is for you.”
LUK.9.51	 Now when
LUK.9.52	 He
LUK.9.53	 but the villagers
LUK.9.54	 Now when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us 
LUK.9.55	 But Jesus
LUK.9.56	 and they went on to another village.
LUK.9.57	 As
LUK.9.58	 Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and the birds in the sky
LUK.9.59	 Jesus
LUK.9.60	 But Jesus
LUK.9.61	 Yet
LUK.9.62	 Jesus
LUK.10.1	 After this
LUK.10.2	 He
LUK.10.3	 Go! I
LUK.10.4	 Do not carry
LUK.10.5	 Whenever
LUK.10.6	 And if a peace-loving person
LUK.10.7	 Stay
LUK.10.8	 Whenever
LUK.10.9	 Heal
LUK.10.10	 But whenever
LUK.10.11	 ‘Even the dust of your town
LUK.10.12	 I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom
LUK.10.13	 “Woe to you, Chorazin!
LUK.10.14	 But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you! 
LUK.10.15	 And you, Capernaum,
LUK.10.16	 “The one who listens
LUK.10.17	 Then
LUK.10.18	 So
LUK.10.19	 Look, I have given you authority to tread
LUK.10.20	 Nevertheless, do not rejoice that
LUK.10.21	 On that same occasion
LUK.10.22	 All things have been given to me by my Father.
LUK.10.23	 Then
LUK.10.24	 For I tell you that many prophets and kings longed to see
LUK.10.25	 Now
LUK.10.26	 He said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you understand it?”
LUK.10.27	 The expert
LUK.10.28	 Jesus
LUK.10.29	 But the expert,
LUK.10.30	 Jesus replied,
LUK.10.31	 Now by chance
LUK.10.32	 So too a Levite, when he came up to
LUK.10.33	 But
LUK.10.34	 He
LUK.10.35	 The
LUK.10.36	 Which of these three do you think became a neighbor
LUK.10.37	 The expert in religious law
LUK.10.38	 Now as they went on their way, Jesus
LUK.10.39	 She
LUK.10.40	 But Martha was distracted
LUK.10.41	 But the Lord
LUK.10.42	 but one thing
LUK.11.1	 Now
LUK.11.2	 So he said to them, “When you pray,
LUK.11.2	Father,
LUK.11.2	may your kingdom come.
LUK.11.3	 Give us each day our daily bread,
LUK.11.4	 and forgive us our sins, 
LUK.11.4	for we also forgive everyone who sins
LUK.11.4	And do not lead us into temptation.”
LUK.11.5	 Then
LUK.11.6	 because a friend of mine has stopped here while on a journey,
LUK.11.7	 Then
LUK.11.8	 I tell you, even though the man inside
LUK.11.9	 “So
LUK.11.10	 For everyone who asks
LUK.11.11	 What father among you, if your
LUK.11.12	 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
LUK.11.13	 If you then, although you are
LUK.11.14	 Now
LUK.11.15	 But some of them said, “By the power of Beelzebul,
LUK.11.16	 Others, to test
LUK.11.17	 But Jesus,
LUK.11.18	 So
LUK.11.19	 Now if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons
LUK.11.20	 But if I cast out demons by the finger
LUK.11.21	 When a strong man,
LUK.11.22	 But
LUK.11.23	 Whoever is not with me is against me,
LUK.11.24	 “When an unclean spirit
LUK.11.25	 When it returns,
LUK.11.26	 Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there, so
LUK.11.27	 As
LUK.11.28	 But he replied,
LUK.11.29	 As
LUK.11.30	 For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh,
LUK.11.31	 The queen of the South
LUK.11.32	 The people
LUK.11.33	 “No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a hidden place
LUK.11.34	 Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy,
LUK.11.35	 Therefore see to it
LUK.11.36	 If
LUK.11.37	 As he spoke,
LUK.11.38	 The
LUK.11.39	 But the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees clean
LUK.11.40	 You fools!
LUK.11.41	 But give from your heart to those in need,
LUK.11.42	 “But woe to you Pharisees!
LUK.11.43	 Woe to you Pharisees! You love the best seats
LUK.11.44	 Woe to you!
LUK.11.45	 One of the experts in religious law
LUK.11.46	 But Jesus
LUK.11.47	 Woe to you! You build
LUK.11.48	 So you testify that you approve of
LUK.11.49	 For this reason also the wisdom
LUK.11.50	 so that this generation may be held accountable
LUK.11.51	 from the blood of Abel
LUK.11.52	 Woe to you experts in religious law! You have taken away
LUK.11.53	 When he went out from there, the experts in the law
LUK.11.54	 plotting against
LUK.12.1	 Meanwhile,
LUK.12.2	 Nothing is hidden
LUK.12.3	 So then
LUK.12.4	 “I
LUK.12.5	 But I will warn
LUK.12.6	 Aren’t five sparrows sold for two pennies?
LUK.12.7	 In fact, even the hairs on your head are all numbered. Do not be afraid;
LUK.12.8	 “I
LUK.12.9	 But the one who denies me before men will be denied before God’s angels. 
LUK.12.10	 And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the person who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit
LUK.12.11	 But when they bring you before the synagogues,
LUK.12.12	 for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that moment
LUK.12.13	 Then
LUK.12.14	 But Jesus
LUK.12.15	 Then
LUK.12.16	 He then
LUK.12.17	 so
LUK.12.18	 Then
LUK.12.19	 And I will say to myself,
LUK.12.20	 But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life

LUK.12.23	 For there is more to life than food, and more to the body than clothing. 
LUK.12.24	 Consider the ravens:

LUK.12.34	 For where your treasure
LUK.12.35	 “Get dressed for service

LUK.12.37	 Blessed are those slaves
LUK.12.38	 Even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night
LUK.12.39	 But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief
LUK.12.40	 You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”
LUK.12.41	 Then
LUK.12.42	 The Lord replied,
LUK.12.43	 Blessed is that slave
LUK.12.44	 I tell you the truth,
LUK.12.45	 But if
LUK.12.46	 then the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not foresee, and will cut him in two,
LUK.12.47	 That
LUK.12.48	 But the one who did not know his master’s will
LUK.12.49	 “I have come
LUK.12.50	 I have a baptism
LUK.12.51	 Do you think I have come to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division!
LUK.12.52	 For from now on
LUK.12.53	 They will be divided,

LUK.12.55	 And when you see the south wind
LUK.12.56	 You hypocrites!
LUK.12.57	 “And
LUK.12.58	 As you are going with your accuser before the magistrate,
LUK.12.59	 I tell you, you will never get out of there until you have paid the very last cent!”
LUK.13.1	 Now
LUK.13.2	 He
LUK.13.3	 No, I tell you! But unless you repent,
LUK.13.4	 Or those eighteen who were killed
LUK.13.5	 No, I tell you! But unless you repent

LUK.13.7	 So
LUK.13.8	 But the worker
LUK.13.9	 Then if
LUK.13.10	 Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues
LUK.13.11	 and a woman was there
LUK.13.12	 When
LUK.13.13	 Then
LUK.13.14	 But the president of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, “There are six days on which work

LUK.13.16	 Then
LUK.13.17	 When
LUK.13.18	 Thus Jesus
LUK.13.19	 It is like a mustard seed
LUK.13.20	 Again

LUK.14.6	 But
LUK.14.7	 Then
LUK.14.8	 “When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast,

LUK.15.21	 Then
LUK.15.22	 But the father said to his slaves,

LUK.15.25	 “Now his older son was in the field. As

LUK.17.7	 “Would any one of you say
LUK.17.8	 Won’t

LUK.17.12	 As
LUK.17.13	 raised their voices and said, “Jesus, Master, have mercy

LUK.17.15	 Then one of them, when he saw he was healed, turned back, praising
LUK.17.16	 He

LUK.17.18	 Was no one found to turn back and give praise to God except this foreigner?”
LUK.17.19	 Then
LUK.17.20	 Now at one point
LUK.17.21	 nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ For indeed, the kingdom of God is

LUK.17.26	 Just
LUK.17.27	 People
LUK.17.28	 Likewise, just as it was
LUK.17.29	 but on the day Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
LUK.17.30	 It will be the same on the day the Son of Man is revealed. 
LUK.17.31	 On that day, anyone who is on the roof,
LUK.17.32	 Remember Lot’s wife!
LUK.17.33	 Whoever tries to keep
LUK.17.34	 I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.
LUK.17.35	 There will be two women grinding grain together;
LUK.17.37	 Then
LUK.18.1	 Then
LUK.18.2	 He said,
LUK.18.3	 There was also a widow
LUK.18.4	 For
LUK.18.5	 yet because this widow keeps on bothering me, I will give her justice, or in the end she will wear me out
LUK.18.6	 And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says!

LUK.18.8	 I tell you, he will give them justice speedily.
LUK.18.9	 Jesus
LUK.18.10	 “Two men went up
LUK.18.11	 The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself like this:
LUK.18.12	 I fast twice
LUK.18.13	 The tax collector, however, stood
LUK.18.14	 I tell you that this man went down to his home justified
LUK.18.15	 Now people
LUK.18.16	 But Jesus called for the children,
LUK.18.17	 I tell you the truth,
LUK.18.18	 Now
LUK.18.19	 Jesus
LUK.18.20	 You know the commandments: ‘
LUK.18.21	 The man
LUK.18.22	 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have
LUK.18.23	 But when the man
LUK.18.24	 When Jesus noticed this,
LUK.18.25	 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
LUK.18.26	 Those who heard this said, “Then
LUK.18.27	 He replied, “What is impossible
LUK.18.28	 And Peter said, “Look, we have left everything we own
LUK.18.29	 Then
LUK.18.30	 who will not receive many times more
LUK.18.31	 Then
LUK.18.32	 For he will be handed over
LUK.18.33	 They will flog him severely
LUK.18.34	 But
LUK.18.35	 As
LUK.18.36	 When he heard a crowd going by, he asked what was going on. 
LUK.18.37	 They
LUK.18.38	 So
LUK.18.39	 And those who were in front
LUK.18.40	 So
LUK.18.41	 “What do you want me to do for you?” He replied,
LUK.18.42	 Jesus
LUK.18.43	 And immediately he regained
LUK.19.1	 Jesus
LUK.19.2	 Now
LUK.19.3	 He
LUK.19.4	 So
LUK.19.5	 And when Jesus came to that place, he looked up
LUK.19.6	 So he came down quickly
LUK.19.7	 And when the people
LUK.19.8	 But Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I now give
LUK.19.9	 Then
LUK.19.10	 For the Son of Man came
LUK.19.11	 While the people were listening to these things, Jesus
LUK.19.12	 Therefore he said, “A nobleman
LUK.19.13	 And he summoned ten of his slaves,
LUK.19.14	 But his citizens
LUK.19.15	 When
LUK.19.16	 So
LUK.19.17	 And the king
LUK.19.18	 Then
LUK.19.19	 So
LUK.19.20	 Then another
LUK.19.21	 For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe
LUK.19.22	 The king
LUK.19.23	 Why then didn’t you put
LUK.19.24	 And he said to his attendants,
LUK.19.25	 But
LUK.19.26	 ‘I tell you that everyone who has will be given more,
LUK.19.27	 But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king,
LUK.19.28	 After Jesus
LUK.19.29	 Now
LUK.19.30	 telling them,
LUK.19.31	 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ just say, ‘The Lord needs
LUK.19.32	 So those who were sent ahead found
LUK.19.33	 As
LUK.19.34	 They replied, “The Lord needs it.” 
LUK.19.35	 Then
LUK.19.36	 As
LUK.19.37	 As he approached the road leading down from
LUK.19.38	 “
LUK.19.39	 But
LUK.19.40	 He answered,
LUK.19.41	 Now
LUK.19.42	 saying, “If you had only known on this day,
LUK.19.43	 For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build
LUK.19.44	 They will demolish you
LUK.19.45	 Then
LUK.19.46	 saying to them, “It is written, ‘
LUK.19.47	 Jesus
LUK.19.48	 but
LUK.20.1	 Now one
LUK.20.2	 and said to him,
LUK.20.3	 He answered them,
LUK.20.4	 John’s baptism
LUK.20.5	 So
LUK.20.6	 But if we say, ‘From people,’ all the people will stone us, because they are convinced that John was a prophet.” 
LUK.20.7	 So
LUK.20.8	 Then
LUK.20.9	 Then
LUK.20.10	 When harvest time came, he sent a slave
LUK.20.11	 So
LUK.20.12	 So
LUK.20.13	 Then
LUK.20.14	 But when the tenants saw him, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir; let’s kill him so the inheritance will be ours!’ 
LUK.20.15	 So
LUK.20.16	 He will come and destroy
LUK.20.17	 But Jesus
LUK.20.18	 Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces,
LUK.20.19	 Then
LUK.20.20	 Then
LUK.20.21	 Thus
LUK.20.22	 Is it right
LUK.20.23	 But Jesus
LUK.20.24	 “Show me a denarius.
LUK.20.25	 So
LUK.20.26	 Thus
LUK.20.27	 Now some Sadducees
LUK.20.28	 They asked him,
LUK.20.29	 Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman
LUK.20.30	 The second
LUK.20.31	 and then the third married her, and in this same way all seven died, leaving no children. 
LUK.20.32	 Finally the woman died too. 
LUK.20.33	 In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be?
LUK.20.34	 So
LUK.20.35	 But those who are regarded as worthy to share in
LUK.20.36	 In fact, they can no longer die, because they are equal to angels
LUK.20.37	 But even Moses revealed that the dead are raised
LUK.20.38	 Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living,
LUK.20.39	 Then
LUK.20.40	 For they did not dare any longer to ask
LUK.20.41	 But
LUK.20.42	 For David himself says in the book of Psalms, 
LUK.20.42	‘
LUK.20.42	“
LUK.20.44	 If David then calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”
LUK.20.45	 As
LUK.20.46	 “Beware
LUK.20.47	 They
LUK.21.1	 Jesus
LUK.21.2	 He also saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.
LUK.21.3	 He
LUK.21.4	 For they all offered their gifts out of their wealth.
LUK.21.5	 Now
LUK.21.6	 “As for these things that you are gazing at, the days will come when not one stone will be left on another.
LUK.21.7	 So
LUK.21.8	 He
LUK.21.9	 And when you hear of wars and rebellions,
LUK.21.10	 Then he said to them, “Nation will rise up in arms
LUK.21.11	 There will be great earthquakes, and famines
LUK.21.12	 But before all this,
LUK.21.13	 This will be a time for you to serve as witnesses.
LUK.21.14	 Therefore be resolved
LUK.21.15	 For I will give you the words
LUK.21.16	 You will be betrayed even by parents,
LUK.21.17	 You will be hated by everyone because of my name.
LUK.21.18	 Yet
LUK.21.19	 By your endurance
LUK.21.20	 “But when you see Jerusalem
LUK.21.21	 Then those who are in Judea must flee
LUK.21.22	 because these are days of vengeance,
LUK.21.23	 Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days! For there will be great distress
LUK.21.24	 They
LUK.21.25	 “And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars,
LUK.21.26	 People will be fainting from fear
LUK.21.27	 Then
LUK.21.28	 But when these things
LUK.21.29	 Then
LUK.21.30	 When they sprout leaves, you see
LUK.21.31	 So also you, when you see these things happening, know
LUK.21.32	 I tell you the truth,
LUK.21.33	 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
LUK.21.34	 “But be on your guard
LUK.21.35	 For
LUK.21.36	 But stay alert at all times,
LUK.21.37	 So
LUK.21.38	 And all the people
LUK.22.1	 Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
LUK.22.2	 The
LUK.22.3	 Then
LUK.22.4	 He went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers of the temple guard
LUK.22.5	 They
LUK.22.6	 So
LUK.22.7	 Then the day for the feast
LUK.22.8	 Jesus
LUK.22.9	 They
LUK.22.10	 He said to them, “Listen,
LUK.22.11	 and tell the owner of the house,
LUK.22.12	 Then he will show you a large furnished room upstairs. Make preparations there.” 
LUK.22.13	 So
LUK.22.14	 Now
LUK.22.15	 And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired
LUK.22.16	 For I tell you, I will not eat it again
LUK.22.17	 Then
LUK.22.18	 For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit
LUK.22.19	 Then
LUK.22.20	 And in the same way he took
LUK.22.21	 “But look, the hand of the one who betrays
LUK.22.22	 For the Son of Man is to go just as it has been determined,
LUK.22.23	 So
LUK.22.24	 A dispute also started
LUK.22.25	 So
LUK.22.26	 Not so with you;
LUK.22.27	 For who is greater, the one who is seated at the table,
LUK.22.28	 “You are the ones who have remained
LUK.22.29	 Thus
LUK.22.30	 that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit
LUK.22.31	 “Simon,
LUK.22.32	 but I have prayed for you, Simon,
LUK.22.33	 But Peter
LUK.22.34	 Jesus replied,
LUK.22.35	 Then
LUK.22.36	 He said to them, “But now, the one who
LUK.22.37	 For I tell you that this scripture must be
LUK.22.38	 So
LUK.22.39	 Then
LUK.22.40	 When he came to the place,
LUK.22.41	 He went away from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed, 
LUK.22.42	 “Father, if you are willing, take
LUK.22.43	 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. 
LUK.22.44	 And in his anguish
LUK.22.45	 When
LUK.22.46	 So
LUK.22.47	 While he was still speaking, suddenly a crowd appeared,
LUK.22.48	 But Jesus said to him, “Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”
LUK.22.49	 When
LUK.22.50	 Then
LUK.22.51	 But Jesus said,
LUK.22.52	 Then
LUK.22.53	 Day after day when I was with you in the temple courts,
LUK.22.54	 Then
LUK.22.55	 When they had made a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. 
LUK.22.56	 Then a slave girl,
LUK.22.57	 But Peter
LUK.22.58	 Then
LUK.22.59	 And after about an hour still another insisted,
LUK.22.60	 But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” At that moment,
LUK.22.61	 Then
LUK.22.62	 And he went outside and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.63	 Now
LUK.22.64	 They
LUK.22.65	 They also said many other things against him, reviling
LUK.22.66	 When day came, the council of the elders of the people gathered together, both the chief priests and the experts in the law.
LUK.22.67	 and said, “If
LUK.22.68	 and if
LUK.22.69	 But from now on
LUK.22.70	 So
LUK.22.71	 Then
LUK.23.1	 Then
LUK.23.2	 They
LUK.23.3	 So
LUK.23.4	 Then
LUK.23.5	 But they persisted
LUK.23.6	 Now when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. 
LUK.23.7	 When
LUK.23.8	 When
LUK.23.9	 So
LUK.23.10	 The chief priests and the experts in the law
LUK.23.11	 Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then,
LUK.23.12	 That very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other,
LUK.23.13	 Then
LUK.23.14	 and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was misleading
LUK.23.15	 Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, he has done nothing
LUK.23.16	 I will therefore have him flogged
LUK.23.18	 But they all shouted out together,
LUK.23.19	 (This
LUK.23.20	 Pilate addressed them once again because he wanted
LUK.23.21	 But they kept on shouting,
LUK.23.22	 A third time he said to them, “Why? What wrong has he done? I have found him guilty
LUK.23.23	 But they were insistent,
LUK.23.24	 So
LUK.23.25	 He released the man they asked for, who had been thrown in prison for insurrection and murder. But he handed Jesus over
LUK.23.26	 As
LUK.23.27	 A great number of the people followed him, among them women
LUK.23.28	 But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem,
LUK.23.29	 For this is certain:
LUK.23.30	 Then they will begin 
LUK.23.31	 For if such things are done
LUK.23.32	 Two other criminals
LUK.23.33	 So
LUK.23.34	 [But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”]
LUK.23.35	 The people also stood there watching, but the rulers ridiculed
LUK.23.36	 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine,
LUK.23.37	 and saying, “If
LUK.23.38	 There was also an inscription
LUK.23.39	 One of the criminals who was hanging there railed at him, saying, “Aren’t
LUK.23.40	 But the other rebuked him, saying,
LUK.23.41	 And we rightly so, for we are getting what we deserve for what we did, but this man has done nothing
LUK.23.42	 Then
LUK.23.43	 And Jesus
LUK.23.44	 It was now
LUK.23.45	 because the sun’s light failed.
LUK.23.46	 Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, 
LUK.23.47	 Now when the centurion
LUK.23.48	 And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts.
LUK.23.49	 And all those who knew Jesus
LUK.23.50	 Now
LUK.23.51	 (He
LUK.23.52	 He went to Pilate and asked for the body
LUK.23.53	 Then
LUK.23.54	 It was the day of preparation
LUK.23.55	 The
LUK.23.56	 Then
LUK.23.56	On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
LUK.24.1	 Now on the first day
LUK.24.2	 They
LUK.24.3	 but when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
LUK.24.4	 While
LUK.24.5	 The
LUK.24.6	 He is not here, but has been raised!
LUK.24.7	 that
LUK.24.8	 Then
LUK.24.9	 and when they returned from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven
LUK.24.10	 Now it was Mary Magdalene,
LUK.24.11	 But these words seemed like pure nonsense
LUK.24.12	 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb.
LUK.24.13	 Now
LUK.24.14	 They
LUK.24.15	 While
LUK.24.16	 (but their eyes were kept
LUK.24.17	 Then
LUK.24.18	 Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him,
LUK.24.19	 He
LUK.24.20	 and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over
LUK.24.21	 But we had hoped
LUK.24.22	 Furthermore, some women of our group amazed us.
LUK.24.23	 and when they did not find his body, they came back and said they had seen a vision of angels,
LUK.24.24	 Then
LUK.24.25	 So
LUK.24.26	 Wasn’t
LUK.24.27	 Then
LUK.24.28	 So they approached the village where they were going. He acted as though he wanted to go farther,
LUK.24.29	 but they urged him,
LUK.24.30	 When
LUK.24.31	 At this point
LUK.24.32	 They
LUK.24.33	 So
LUK.24.34	 and
LUK.24.35	 Then they told what had happened on the road,
LUK.24.36	 While they were saying these things, Jesus
LUK.24.37	 But they were startled and terrified, thinking
LUK.24.38	 Then
LUK.24.39	 Look at my hands and my feet; it’s me!
LUK.24.40	 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
LUK.24.41	 And while they still could not believe it
LUK.24.42	 So
LUK.24.43	 and he took it and ate it in front of them.
LUK.24.44	 Then
LUK.24.45	 Then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures,
LUK.24.46	 and said to them, “Thus it stands written that the Christ
LUK.24.47	 and repentance
LUK.24.48	 You are witnesses
LUK.24.49	 And look, I am sending you
LUK.24.50	 Then
LUK.24.51	 Now
LUK.24.52	 So
LUK.24.53	 and were continually in the temple courts
JHN.1.1	 In the beginning
JHN.1.2	 The Word
JHN.1.3	 All things were created
JHN.1.5	 And the light shines on
JHN.1.6	 A man came, sent from God, whose name was John.
JHN.1.7	 He came as a witness
JHN.1.8	 He himself was not the light, but he came to testify
JHN.1.9	 The true light, who gives light to everyone,
JHN.1.10	 He was in the world, and the world was created
JHN.1.11	 He came to what was his own,
JHN.1.12	 But to all who have received him – those who believe in his name
JHN.1.13	 – children not born
JHN.1.14	 Now
JHN.1.15	 John
JHN.1.16	 For we have all received from his fullness one gracious gift after another.
JHN.1.17	 For the law was given through Moses, but
JHN.1.18	 No one has ever seen God. The only one,
JHN.1.19	 Now
JHN.1.20	 He confessed – he did not deny but confessed – “I am not the Christ!”
JHN.1.21	 So they asked him, “Then who are you?
JHN.1.22	 Then they said to him, “Who are you? Tell us
JHN.1.23	 John
JHN.1.24	 (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.
JHN.1.25	 So they asked John,
JHN.1.26	 John answered them,
JHN.1.27	 who is coming after me. I am not worthy
JHN.1.28	 These things happened in Bethany
JHN.1.29	 On the next day John
JHN.1.30	 This is the one about whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is greater than I am,
JHN.1.31	 I did not recognize
JHN.1.32	 Then
JHN.1.33	 And I did not recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining – this is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ 
JHN.1.34	 I have both seen and testified that this man is the Chosen One of God.”
JHN.1.35	 Again the next day John
JHN.1.36	 Gazing at Jesus as he walked by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”
JHN.1.37	 When John’s
JHN.1.38	 Jesus turned around and saw them following and said to them, “What do you want?”
JHN.1.39	 Jesus
JHN.1.40	 Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two disciples who heard what John said
JHN.1.41	 He first
JHN.1.42	 Andrew brought Simon
JHN.1.43	 On the next day Jesus
JHN.1.44	 (Now Philip was from Bethsaida,
JHN.1.45	 Philip found Nathanael
JHN.1.46	 Nathanael
JHN.1.47	 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and exclaimed,
JHN.1.48	 Nathanael asked him, “How do you know me?” Jesus replied,
JHN.1.49	 Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king
JHN.1.50	 Jesus said to him,
JHN.1.51	 He continued,
JHN.2.1	 Now on the third day there was a wedding at Cana
JHN.2.2	 and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.
JHN.2.3	 When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine left.”
JHN.2.4	 Jesus replied,
JHN.2.5	 His mother told the servants, “Whatever he tells you, do it.”
JHN.2.6	 Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washing,
JHN.2.7	 Jesus told the servants,
JHN.2.8	 Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the head steward,”
JHN.2.9	 When
JHN.2.10	 and said to him, “Everyone
JHN.2.11	 Jesus did this as the first of his miraculous signs,
JHN.2.12	 After this he went down to Capernaum
JHN.2.13	 Now the Jewish feast of Passover
JHN.2.14	 He found in the temple courts
JHN.2.15	 So he made a whip of cords
JHN.2.16	 To those who sold the doves he said, “Take these things away from here! Do not make
JHN.2.17	 His disciples remembered that it was written, “
JHN.2.18	 So then the Jewish leaders
JHN.2.19	 Jesus replied,
JHN.2.20	 Then the Jewish leaders
JHN.2.21	 But Jesus
JHN.2.22	 So after he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture
JHN.2.23	 Now while Jesus
JHN.2.24	 But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people.
JHN.2.25	 He did not need anyone to testify about man,
JHN.3.1	 Now a certain man, a Pharisee
JHN.3.2	 came to Jesus
JHN.3.3	 Jesus replied,
JHN.3.4	 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb and be born a second time, can he?”
JHN.3.5	 Jesus answered, “I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.3.6	 What is born of the flesh is flesh,
JHN.3.7	 Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must all
JHN.3.8	 The wind
JHN.3.9	 Nicodemus replied,
JHN.3.10	 Jesus answered,
JHN.3.11	 I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.3.12	 If I have told you people
JHN.3.13	 No one
JHN.3.14	 Just as
JHN.3.15	 so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”
JHN.3.16	 For this is the way
JHN.3.17	 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,
JHN.3.18	 The one who believes in him is not condemned.
JHN.3.19	 Now this is the basis for judging:
JHN.3.20	 For everyone who does evil deeds hates the light and does not come to the light, so that their deeds will not be exposed. 
JHN.3.21	 But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, so that it may be plainly evident that his deeds have been done in God.
JHN.3.22	 After this,
JHN.3.23	 John
JHN.3.24	 (For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)
JHN.3.25	 Now a dispute came about between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew
JHN.3.26	 So they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River,
JHN.3.27	 John replied,
JHN.3.28	 You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’
JHN.3.29	 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands by and listens for him, rejoices greatly
JHN.3.30	 He must become more important while I become less important.”
JHN.3.31	 The one who comes from above is superior to all.
JHN.3.32	 He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. 
JHN.3.33	 The one who has accepted his testimony has confirmed clearly that God is truthful.
JHN.3.34	 For the one whom God has sent
JHN.3.35	 The Father loves the Son and has placed all things under his authority.
JHN.3.36	 The one who believes in the Son has eternal life. The one who rejects
JHN.4.1	 Now when Jesus
JHN.4.2	 (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were),
JHN.4.3	 he left Judea and set out once more for Galilee.
JHN.4.4	 But he had
JHN.4.5	 Now he came to a Samaritan town
JHN.4.6	 Jacob’s well was there, so Jesus, since he was tired from the journey, sat right down beside
JHN.4.7	 A Samaritan woman
JHN.4.8	 (For his disciples had gone off into the town to buy supplies.
JHN.4.9	 So the Samaritan woman said to him, “How can you – a Jew
JHN.4.10	 Jesus answered
JHN.4.11	 “Sir,”
JHN.4.12	 Surely you’re not greater than our ancestor
JHN.4.13	 Jesus replied,
JHN.4.14	 But whoever drinks some of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again,
JHN.4.15	 The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw
JHN.4.16	 He
JHN.4.17	 The woman replied,
JHN.4.18	 for you have had five husbands, and the man you are living with
JHN.4.19	 The woman said to him, “Sir, I see
JHN.4.20	 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain,
JHN.4.21	 Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman,
JHN.4.22	 You people
JHN.4.23	 But a time
JHN.4.24	 God is spirit,
JHN.4.25	 The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (the one called Christ);
JHN.4.26	 Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.”
JHN.4.27	 Now at that very moment his disciples came back.
JHN.4.28	 Then the woman left her water jar, went off into the town and said to the people,
JHN.4.29	 “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Surely he can’t be the Messiah,
JHN.4.30	 So
JHN.4.31	 Meanwhile the disciples were urging him,
JHN.4.32	 But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” 
JHN.4.33	 So the disciples began to say
JHN.4.34	 Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of the one who sent me
JHN.4.35	 Don’t you say,
JHN.4.36	 The one who reaps receives pay
JHN.4.37	 For in this instance the saying is true,
JHN.4.38	 I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have labored and you have entered into their labor.”
JHN.4.39	 Now many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the report of the woman who testified,
JHN.4.40	 So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking
JHN.4.41	 and because of his word many more
JHN.4.42	 They said to the woman, “No longer do we believe because of your words, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this one
JHN.4.43	 After the two days he departed from there to Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	 (For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)
JHN.4.45	 So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem
JHN.4.46	 Now he came again to Cana
JHN.4.47	 When he heard that Jesus had come back from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him
JHN.4.48	 So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people
JHN.4.49	 “Sir,” the official said to him, “come down before my child dies.” 
JHN.4.50	 Jesus told him, “Go home;
JHN.4.51	 While he was on his way down,
JHN.4.52	 So he asked them the time
JHN.4.53	 Then the father realized that it was the very time
JHN.4.54	 Jesus did this as his second miraculous sign
JHN.5.1	 After this
JHN.5.2	 Now there is
JHN.5.3	 A great number of sick, blind, lame, and paralyzed people were lying in these walkways.
JHN.5.5	 Now a man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years.
JHN.5.6	 When Jesus saw him lying there and when he realized
JHN.5.7	 The sick man answered him, “Sir,
JHN.5.8	 Jesus said to him, “Stand up! Pick up your mat
JHN.5.9	 Immediately the man was healed,
JHN.5.10	 So the Jewish leaders
JHN.5.11	 But he answered them, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat
JHN.5.12	 They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick up your mat
JHN.5.13	 But the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped out, since there was a crowd in that place.
JHN.5.14	 After this Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “Look, you have become well. Don’t sin any more,
JHN.5.15	 The man went away and informed the Jewish leaders
JHN.5.16	 Now because Jesus was doing these things
JHN.5.17	 So he
JHN.5.18	 For this reason the Jewish leaders
JHN.5.19	 So Jesus answered them,
JHN.5.20	 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he does, and will show him greater deeds than these, so that you will be amazed. 
JHN.5.21	 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life,
JHN.5.22	 Furthermore, the Father does not judge
JHN.5.23	 so that all people
JHN.5.24	 “I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.5.25	 I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.5.26	 For just as the Father has life in himself, thus he has granted the Son to have life in himself, 
JHN.5.27	 and he has granted the Son
JHN.5.28	 “Do not be amazed at this, because a time
JHN.5.29	 and will come out – the ones who have done what is good to the resurrection resulting in life, and the ones who have done what is evil to the resurrection resulting in condemnation.
JHN.5.30	 I can do nothing on my own initiative.
JHN.5.31	 “If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. 
JHN.5.32	 There is another
JHN.5.33	 You have sent to John,
JHN.5.34	 (I do not accept
JHN.5.35	 He was a lamp that was burning and shining,
JHN.5.36	 “But I have a testimony greater than that from John. For the deeds
JHN.5.37	 And the Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You people
JHN.5.38	 nor do you have his word residing in you, because you do not believe the one whom he sent. 
JHN.5.39	 You study the scriptures thoroughly
JHN.5.40	 but you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.
JHN.5.41	 “I do not accept
JHN.5.42	 but I know you, that you do not have the love of God
JHN.5.43	 I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept
JHN.5.44	 How can you believe, if you accept praise
JHN.5.45	 “Do not suppose that I will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have placed your hope.
JHN.5.46	 If
JHN.5.47	 But if you do not believe what Moses
JHN.6.1	 After this
JHN.6.2	 A large crowd was following him because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing on the sick. 
JHN.6.3	 So Jesus went on up the mountainside
JHN.6.4	 (Now the Jewish feast of the Passover
JHN.6.5	 Then Jesus, when he looked up
JHN.6.6	 (Now Jesus
JHN.6.7	 Philip replied,
JHN.6.8	 One of Jesus’ disciples,
JHN.6.9	 “Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what good
JHN.6.10	 Jesus said, “Have
JHN.6.11	 Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed the bread to those who were seated. He then did the same with the fish,
JHN.6.12	 When they were all satisfied, Jesus
JHN.6.13	 So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves
JHN.6.14	 Now when the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus
JHN.6.15	 Then Jesus, because he knew they were going to come and seize him by force to make him king, withdrew again up the mountainside alone.
JHN.6.16	 Now when evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,
JHN.6.17	 got into a boat, and started to cross the lake
JHN.6.18	 By now a strong wind was blowing and the sea was getting rough. 
JHN.6.19	 Then, when they had rowed about three or four miles,
JHN.6.20	 But he said to them, “It is I. Do not be afraid.” 
JHN.6.21	 Then they wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land where they had been heading.
JHN.6.22	 The next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the lake
JHN.6.23	 But some boats from Tiberias
JHN.6.24	 So when the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats
JHN.6.25	 When they found him on the other side of the lake,
JHN.6.26	 Jesus replied,
JHN.6.27	 Do not work for the food that disappears,
JHN.6.28	 So then they said to him, “What must we do to accomplish the deeds
JHN.6.29	 Jesus replied,
JHN.6.30	 So they said to him, “Then what miraculous sign will you perform, so that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? 
JHN.6.31	 Our ancestors
JHN.6.32	 Then Jesus told them, “I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.6.33	 For the bread of God is the one who
JHN.6.34	 So they said to him, “Sir,
JHN.6.35	 Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never go hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty.
JHN.6.36	 But I told you
JHN.6.37	 Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never send away.
JHN.6.38	 For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me. 
JHN.6.39	 Now this is the will of the one who sent me – that I should not lose one person of every one he has given me, but raise them all up
JHN.6.40	 For this is the will of my Father – for everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him to have eternal life, and I will raise him up
JHN.6.41	 Then the Jews who were hostile to Jesus
JHN.6.42	 and they said, “Isn’t this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” 
JHN.6.43	 Jesus replied,
JHN.6.44	 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him,
JHN.6.45	 It is written in the prophets, ‘
JHN.6.46	 (Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God – he
JHN.6.47	 I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.6.48	 I am the bread of life.
JHN.6.49	 Your ancestors
JHN.6.50	 This
JHN.6.51	 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread he will live forever. The bread
JHN.6.52	 Then the Jews who were hostile to Jesus
JHN.6.53	 Jesus said to them, “I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.6.54	 The one who eats
JHN.6.55	 For my flesh is true
JHN.6.56	 The one who eats
JHN.6.57	 Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so the one who consumes
JHN.6.58	 This
JHN.6.59	 Jesus
JHN.6.60	 Then many of his disciples, when they heard these things,
JHN.6.61	 When Jesus was aware
JHN.6.62	 Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?
JHN.6.63	 The Spirit is the one who gives life; human nature is of no help!
JHN.6.64	 But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus had already known from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.)
JHN.6.65	 So Jesus added,
JHN.6.66	 After this many of his disciples quit following him
JHN.6.67	 So Jesus said to the twelve, “You don’t want to go away too, do you?”
JHN.6.68	 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. 
JHN.6.69	 We
JHN.6.70	 Jesus replied,
JHN.6.71	 (Now he said this about Judas son of Simon Iscariot,
JHN.7.1	 After this
JHN.7.2	 Now the Jewish feast of Tabernacles
JHN.7.3	 So Jesus’ brothers
JHN.7.4	 For no one who seeks to make a reputation for himself
JHN.7.5	 (For not even his own brothers believed in him.)
JHN.7.6	 So Jesus replied,
JHN.7.7	 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying about it that its deeds are evil. 
JHN.7.8	 You go up
JHN.7.9	 When he had said this, he remained in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	 But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then Jesus
JHN.7.11	 So the Jewish leaders
JHN.7.12	 There was
JHN.7.13	 However, no one spoke openly about him for fear of the Jewish leaders.
JHN.7.14	 When the feast was half over, Jesus went up to the temple courts
JHN.7.15	 Then the Jewish leaders
JHN.7.16	 So Jesus replied,
JHN.7.17	 If anyone wants to do God’s will,
JHN.7.18	 The person who speaks on his own authority
JHN.7.19	 Hasn’t Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps
JHN.7.20	 The crowd
JHN.7.21	 Jesus replied,
JHN.7.22	 However, because Moses gave you the practice of circumcision
JHN.7.23	 But if a male child
JHN.7.24	 Do not judge according to external appearance,
JHN.7.25	 Then some of the residents of Jerusalem
JHN.7.26	 Yet here he is, speaking publicly,
JHN.7.27	 But we know where this man
JHN.7.28	 Then Jesus, while teaching in the temple courts,
JHN.7.29	 but
JHN.7.30	 So then they tried to seize Jesus,
JHN.7.31	 Yet many of the crowd
JHN.7.32	 The Pharisees
JHN.7.33	 Then Jesus said, “I will be with you for only a little while longer,
JHN.7.34	 You will look for me
JHN.7.35	 Then the Jewish leaders
JHN.7.36	 What did he mean by saying,
JHN.7.37	 On the last day of the feast, the greatest day,
JHN.7.38	 let the one who believes in me drink.
JHN.7.39	 (Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were going to receive, for the Spirit had not yet been given,
JHN.7.40	 When they heard these words, some of the crowd
JHN.7.41	 Others said, “This is the Christ!”
JHN.7.42	 Don’t the scriptures say that the Christ is
JHN.7.43	 So there was a division in the crowd
JHN.7.44	 Some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.
JHN.7.45	 Then the officers
JHN.7.46	 The officers replied, “No one ever spoke like this man!” 
JHN.7.47	 Then the Pharisees answered,
JHN.7.48	 None of the rulers
JHN.7.49	 But this rabble
JHN.7.50	 Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus
JHN.7.51	 “Our law doesn’t condemn
JHN.7.52	 They replied,
JHN.7.52	[[ 
JHN.7.53	 And each one departed to his own house. 
JHN.8.1	 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
JHN.8.2	 Early in the morning he came to the temple courts again. All the people came to him, and he sat down and began to teach
JHN.8.3	 The experts in the law
JHN.8.4	 and said to Jesus,
JHN.8.5	 In the law 
JHN.8.6	 (Now they were asking this in an attempt to trap him, so that they could bring charges against
JHN.8.7	 When they persisted in asking him, he stood up straight
JHN.8.8	 Then
JHN.8.9	 Now when they heard this, they began to drift away one at a time, starting with the older ones,
JHN.8.10	 Jesus stood up straight
JHN.8.11	 She replied, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “I do not condemn you either. Go, and from now on do not sin any more.”]]
JHN.8.12	 Then Jesus spoke out again,
JHN.8.13	 So the Pharisees
JHN.8.14	 Jesus answered,
JHN.8.15	 You people
JHN.8.16	 But if I judge, my evaluation is accurate,
JHN.8.17	 It is written in your law that 
JHN.8.18	 I testify about myself
JHN.8.19	 Then they began asking
JHN.8.20	 (Jesus
JHN.8.21	 Then Jesus
JHN.8.22	 So the Jewish leaders
JHN.8.23	 Jesus replied,
JHN.8.24	 Thus I told you
JHN.8.25	 So they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus replied,
JHN.8.26	 I have many things to say and to judge
JHN.8.27	 (They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.)
JHN.8.28	 Then Jesus said,
JHN.8.29	 And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone,
JHN.8.30	 While he was saying these things, many people
JHN.8.31	 Then Jesus said to those Judeans
JHN.8.32	 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
JHN.8.33	 “We are descendants
JHN.8.34	 Jesus answered them, “I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.8.35	 The slave does not remain in the family
JHN.8.36	 So if the son
JHN.8.37	 I know that you are Abraham’s descendants.
JHN.8.38	 I am telling you the things I have seen while with the
JHN.8.39	 They answered him,
JHN.8.40	 But now you are trying
JHN.8.41	 You people
JHN.8.41	Then
JHN.8.42	 Jesus replied,
JHN.8.43	 Why don’t you understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot accept
JHN.8.44	 You people
JHN.8.45	 But because I am telling you
JHN.8.46	 Who among you can prove me guilty
JHN.8.47	 The one who belongs to
JHN.8.48	 The Judeans
JHN.8.49	 Jesus answered, “I am not possessed by a demon,
JHN.8.50	 I am not trying to get
JHN.8.51	 I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.8.52	 Then
JHN.8.53	 You aren’t greater than our father Abraham who died, are you?
JHN.8.54	 Jesus replied,
JHN.8.55	 Yet
JHN.8.56	 Your father Abraham was overjoyed
JHN.8.57	 Then the Judeans
JHN.8.58	 Jesus said to them, “I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.8.59	 Then they picked up
JHN.9.1	 Now as Jesus was passing by,
JHN.9.2	 His disciples asked him,
JHN.9.3	 Jesus answered, “Neither this man
JHN.9.4	 We must perform the deeds
JHN.9.5	 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
JHN.9.6	 Having said this,
JHN.9.7	 and said to him, “Go wash in the pool of Siloam”
JHN.9.8	 Then the neighbors and the people who had seen him previously
JHN.9.9	 Some people said,
JHN.9.10	 So they asked him,
JHN.9.11	 He replied,
JHN.9.12	 They said
JHN.9.13	 They brought the man who used to be blind
JHN.9.14	 (Now the day on which Jesus made the mud
JHN.9.15	 So the Pharisees asked him again how he had gained his sight.
JHN.9.16	 Then some of the Pharisees began to say,
JHN.9.17	 So again they asked the man who used to be blind,
JHN.9.18	 Now the Jewish religious leaders
JHN.9.19	 They asked the parents,
JHN.9.20	 So his parents replied,
JHN.9.21	 But we do not know how he is now able to see, nor do we know who caused him to see.
JHN.9.22	 (His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders.
JHN.9.23	 For this reason his parents said, “He is a mature adult,
JHN.9.24	 Then they summoned
JHN.9.25	 He replied,
JHN.9.26	 Then they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he cause you to see?”
JHN.9.27	 He answered,
JHN.9.28	 They
JHN.9.29	 We know that God has spoken to Moses! We do not know where this man
JHN.9.30	 The man replied,
JHN.9.31	 We know that God doesn’t listen to
JHN.9.32	 Never before
JHN.9.33	 If this man
JHN.9.34	 They replied,
JHN.9.35	 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, so he found the man
JHN.9.36	 The man
JHN.9.37	 Jesus told him, “You have seen him; he
JHN.9.38	 He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
JHN.9.39	 Jesus
JHN.9.40	 Some of the Pharisees
JHN.9.41	 Jesus replied,
JHN.10.1	 “I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.10.2	 The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
JHN.10.3	 The doorkeeper
JHN.10.4	 When he has brought all his own sheep
JHN.10.5	 They will never follow a stranger,
JHN.10.6	 Jesus told them this parable,
JHN.10.7	 So Jesus said to them again, “I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.10.8	 All who came before me were
JHN.10.9	 I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will come in and go out,
JHN.10.10	 The thief comes only to steal and kill
JHN.10.11	 “I am the good
JHN.10.12	 The hired hand,
JHN.10.13	 Because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep,
JHN.10.14	 “I am the good shepherd. I
JHN.10.15	 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father – and I lay down my life
JHN.10.16	 I have
JHN.10.17	 This is why the Father loves me
JHN.10.18	 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down
JHN.10.19	 Another sharp division took place among the Jewish people
JHN.10.20	 Many of them were saying, “He is possessed by a demon and has lost his mind!
JHN.10.21	 Others said, “These are not the words
JHN.10.22	 Then came the feast of the Dedication
JHN.10.23	 It was winter,
JHN.10.24	 The Jewish leaders
JHN.10.25	 Jesus replied,
JHN.10.26	 But you refuse to believe because you are not my sheep. 
JHN.10.27	 My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 
JHN.10.28	 I give
JHN.10.29	 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all,
JHN.10.30	 The Father and I
JHN.10.31	 The Jewish leaders
JHN.10.32	 Jesus said to them,
JHN.10.33	 The Jewish leaders
JHN.10.34	 Jesus answered,
JHN.10.35	 If those people to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’ (and the scripture cannot be broken),
JHN.10.36	 do you say about the one whom the Father set apart
JHN.10.37	 If I do not perform
JHN.10.38	 But if I do them, even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds,
JHN.10.39	 Then
JHN.10.40	 Jesus
JHN.10.41	 Many
JHN.10.42	 And many believed in Jesus
JHN.11.1	 Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived.
JHN.11.2	 (Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil
JHN.11.3	 So the sisters sent a message
JHN.11.4	 When Jesus heard this, he said, “This sickness will not lead to death,
JHN.11.5	 (Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.)
JHN.11.6	 So when he heard that Lazarus
JHN.11.7	 Then after this, he said to his disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.”
JHN.11.8	 The disciples replied,
JHN.11.9	 Jesus replied,
JHN.11.10	 But if anyone walks around at night,
JHN.11.11	 After he said this, he added,
JHN.11.12	 Then the disciples replied,
JHN.11.13	 (Now Jesus had been talking about
JHN.11.14	 Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died, 
JHN.11.15	 and I am glad
JHN.11.16	 So Thomas (called Didymus
JHN.11.17	 When
JHN.11.18	 (Now Bethany was less than two miles
JHN.11.19	 so many of the Jewish people of the region
JHN.11.20	 So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house.
JHN.11.21	 Martha
JHN.11.22	 But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will grant
JHN.11.23	 Jesus replied,
JHN.11.24	 Martha said,
JHN.11.25	 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live
JHN.11.26	 and the one who lives and believes in me will never die.
JHN.11.27	 She replied,
JHN.11.28	 And when she had said this, Martha
JHN.11.29	 So when Mary
JHN.11.30	 (Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still in the place where Martha had come out to meet him.) 
JHN.11.31	 Then the people
JHN.11.32	 Now when Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” 
JHN.11.33	 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people
JHN.11.34	 He asked,
JHN.11.35	 Jesus wept.
JHN.11.36	 Thus the people who had come to mourn
JHN.11.37	 But some of them said, “This is the man who caused the blind man to see!
JHN.11.38	 Jesus, intensely moved
JHN.11.39	 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.”
JHN.11.40	 Jesus responded,
JHN.11.41	 So they took away
JHN.11.42	 I knew that you always listen to me,
JHN.11.43	 When
JHN.11.44	 The one who had died came out, his feet and hands tied up with strips of cloth,
JHN.11.45	 Then many of the people,
JHN.11.46	 But some of them went to the Pharisees
JHN.11.47	 So the chief priests and the Pharisees
JHN.11.48	 If we allow him to go on in this way,
JHN.11.49	 Then one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said,
JHN.11.50	 You do not realize
JHN.11.51	 (Now he did not say this on his own,
JHN.11.52	 and not for the Jewish nation
JHN.11.53	 So from that day they planned together to kill him.
JHN.11.54	 Thus Jesus no longer went
JHN.11.55	 Now the Jewish feast of Passover
JHN.11.56	 Thus they were looking for Jesus,
JHN.11.57	 (Now the chief priests and the Pharisees
JHN.12.1	 Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom he
JHN.12.2	 So they prepared a dinner for Jesus
JHN.12.3	 Then Mary took three quarters of a pound
JHN.12.4	 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him)
JHN.12.5	 “Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred silver coins
JHN.12.6	 (Now Judas
JHN.12.7	 So Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She has kept it for the day of my burial.
JHN.12.8	 For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me!”
JHN.12.9	 Now a large crowd of Judeans
JHN.12.10	 So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too,
JHN.12.11	 for on account of him many of the Jewish people from Jerusalem
JHN.12.12	 The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
JHN.12.13	 So they took branches of palm trees
JHN.12.14	 Jesus found a young donkey
JHN.12.15	 “
JHN.12.16	 (His disciples did not understand these things when they first happened,
JHN.12.17	 So the crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify about it.
JHN.12.18	 Because they had heard that Jesus
JHN.12.19	 Thus the Pharisees
JHN.12.20	 Now some Greeks
JHN.12.21	 So these approached Philip,
JHN.12.22	 Philip went and told Andrew, and they both
JHN.12.23	 Jesus replied,
JHN.12.24	 I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.12.25	 The one who loves his life
JHN.12.26	 If anyone wants to serve me, he must follow
JHN.12.27	 “Now my soul is greatly distressed. And what should I say? ‘Father, deliver me
JHN.12.28	 Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven,
JHN.12.29	 The crowd that stood there and heard the voice
JHN.12.30	 Jesus said,
JHN.12.31	 Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world
JHN.12.32	 And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people
JHN.12.33	 (Now he said this to indicate clearly what kind of death he was going to die.)
JHN.12.34	 Then the crowd responded,
JHN.12.35	 Jesus replied,
JHN.12.36	 While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light.”
JHN.12.37	 Although Jesus
JHN.12.38	 so that the word
JHN.12.39	 For this reason they could not believe,
JHN.12.40	 “
JHN.12.40	”
JHN.12.41	 Isaiah said these things because he saw Christ’s
JHN.12.42	 Nevertheless, even among the rulers
JHN.12.43	 For they loved praise
JHN.12.44	 But Jesus shouted out,
JHN.12.45	 and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me.
JHN.12.46	 I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness. 
JHN.12.47	 If anyone
JHN.12.48	 The one who rejects me and does not accept
JHN.12.49	 For I have not spoken from my own authority,
JHN.12.50	 And I know that his commandment is eternal life.
JHN.13.1	 Just before the Passover feast, Jesus knew that his time
JHN.13.2	 The evening meal
JHN.13.3	 Because Jesus
JHN.13.4	 he got up from the meal, removed
JHN.13.5	 He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel he had wrapped around himself.
JHN.13.6	 Then he came to Simon Peter. Peter
JHN.13.7	 Jesus replied,
JHN.13.8	 Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!”
JHN.13.9	 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, wash
JHN.13.10	 Jesus replied,
JHN.13.11	 (For Jesus
JHN.13.12	 So when Jesus
JHN.13.13	 You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and do so correctly,
JHN.13.14	 If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you too ought to wash one another’s feet. 
JHN.13.15	 For I have given you an example
JHN.13.16	 I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.13.17	 If you understand
JHN.13.18	 “What I am saying does not refer to all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture,
JHN.13.19	 I am telling you this now,
JHN.13.20	 I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.13.21	 When he had said these things, Jesus was greatly distressed
JHN.13.22	 The disciples began to look at one another, worried and perplexed
JHN.13.23	 One of his disciples, the one Jesus loved,
JHN.13.24	 So Simon Peter
JHN.13.25	 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved
JHN.13.26	 Jesus replied,
JHN.13.27	 And after Judas
JHN.13.28	 (Now none of those present at the table
JHN.13.29	 Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him to buy whatever they needed for the feast,
JHN.13.30	 Judas
JHN.13.31	 When
JHN.13.32	 If God is glorified in him,
JHN.13.33	 Children, I am still with you for a little while. You will look for me,
JHN.13.34	 “I give you a new commandment – to love
JHN.13.35	 Everyone
JHN.13.36	 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied,
JHN.13.37	 Peter said to him, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!”
JHN.13.38	 Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me?
JHN.14.1	 “Do not let your hearts be distressed.
JHN.14.2	 There are many dwelling places
JHN.14.3	 And if I go and make ready
JHN.14.4	 And you know the way where I am going.”
JHN.14.5	 Thomas said,
JHN.14.6	 Jesus replied,
JHN.14.7	 If you have known me, you will know my Father too.
JHN.14.8	 Philip said,
JHN.14.9	 Jesus replied,
JHN.14.10	 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me?
JHN.14.11	 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me, but if you do not believe me,
JHN.14.12	 I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.14.13	 And I will do whatever you ask in my name,
JHN.14.14	 If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.
JHN.14.15	 “If you love me, you will obey
JHN.14.16	 Then
JHN.14.17	 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept,
JHN.14.18	 “I will not abandon
JHN.14.19	 In a little while
JHN.14.20	 You will know at that time
JHN.14.21	 The person who has my commandments and obeys
JHN.14.22	 “Lord,” Judas (not Judas Iscariot)
JHN.14.23	 Jesus replied,
JHN.14.24	 The person who does not love me does not obey
JHN.14.25	 “I have spoken these things while staying
JHN.14.26	 But the Advocate,
JHN.14.27	 “Peace I leave with you;
JHN.14.28	 You heard me say to you,
JHN.14.29	 I have told you now before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe.
JHN.14.30	 I will not speak with you much longer,
JHN.14.31	 but I am doing just what the Father commanded me, so that the world may know
JHN.15.1	 “I am the true vine
JHN.15.2	 He takes away
JHN.15.3	 You are clean already
JHN.15.4	 Remain
JHN.15.5	 “I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains
JHN.15.6	 If anyone does not remain
JHN.15.7	 If you remain
JHN.15.8	 My Father is honored
JHN.15.9	 “Just as the Father has loved me, I have also loved you; remain
JHN.15.10	 If you obey
JHN.15.11	 I have told you these things
JHN.15.12	 My commandment is this – to love one another just as I have loved you.
JHN.15.13	 No one has greater love than this – that one lays down his life
JHN.15.14	 You are my friends
JHN.15.15	 I no longer call you slaves,
JHN.15.16	 You did not choose me, but I chose you
JHN.15.17	 This
JHN.15.18	 “If the world hates you, be aware
JHN.15.19	 If you belonged to the world,
JHN.15.20	 Remember what
JHN.15.21	 But they will do all these things to you on account of
JHN.15.22	 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin.
JHN.15.23	 The one who hates me hates my Father too. 
JHN.15.24	 If I had not performed
JHN.15.25	 Now this happened
JHN.15.26	 When the Advocate
JHN.15.27	 and you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
JHN.16.1	 “I have told you all these things so that you will not fall away.
JHN.16.2	 They will put you out of
JHN.16.3	 They
JHN.16.4	 But I have told you these things
JHN.16.4	“I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you.
JHN.16.5	 But now I am going to the one who sent me,
JHN.16.6	 Instead your hearts are filled with sadness
JHN.16.7	 But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the Advocate
JHN.16.8	 And when he
JHN.16.9	 concerning sin, because
JHN.16.10	 concerning righteousness,
JHN.16.11	 and concerning judgment,
JHN.16.12	 “I have many more things to say to you,
JHN.16.13	 But when he,
JHN.16.14	 He
JHN.16.15	 Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said the Spirit
JHN.16.16	 In a little while you
JHN.16.17	 Then some of his disciples said to one another, “What is the meaning of what he is saying,
JHN.16.18	 So they kept on repeating,
JHN.16.19	 Jesus could see
JHN.16.20	 I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.16.21	 When a woman gives birth, she has distress
JHN.16.22	 So also you have sorrow
JHN.16.23	 At that time
JHN.16.24	 Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive it,
JHN.16.25	 “I have told you these things in obscure figures of speech;
JHN.16.26	 At that time
JHN.16.27	 For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.
JHN.16.28	 I came from the Father and entered into the world, but in turn,
JHN.16.29	 His disciples said, “Look, now you are speaking plainly
JHN.16.30	 Now we know that you know everything
JHN.16.31	 Jesus replied,
JHN.16.32	 Look, a time
JHN.16.33	 I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble and suffering,
JHN.17.1	 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he looked upward
JHN.17.2	 just as you have given him authority over all humanity,
JHN.17.3	 Now this
JHN.17.4	 I glorified you on earth by completing
JHN.17.5	 And now, Father, glorify me at your side
JHN.17.6	 “I have revealed
JHN.17.7	 Now they understand
JHN.17.8	 because I have given them the words you have given me. They
JHN.17.9	 I am praying
JHN.17.10	 Everything
JHN.17.11	 I
JHN.17.12	 When I was with them I kept them safe
JHN.17.13	 But now I am coming to you, and I am saying these things in the world, so they may experience
JHN.17.14	 I have given them your word,
JHN.17.15	 I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but that you keep them safe
JHN.17.16	 They do not belong to the world
JHN.17.17	 Set them apart
JHN.17.18	 Just as you sent me into the world, so I sent them into the world.
JHN.17.19	 And I set myself apart
JHN.17.20	 “I am not praying
JHN.17.21	 that they will all be one, just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you. I pray
JHN.17.22	 The glory
JHN.17.23	 I in them and you in me – that they may be completely one,
JHN.17.24	 “Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am,
JHN.17.25	 Righteous Father, even if the world does not know you, I know you, and these men
JHN.17.26	 I made known your name to them, and I will continue to make it known,
JHN.18.1	 When he had said these things,
JHN.18.2	 (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, knew the place too, because Jesus had met there many times
JHN.18.3	 So Judas obtained a squad of soldiers
JHN.18.4	 Then Jesus, because he knew everything that was going to happen to him,
JHN.18.5	 They replied,
JHN.18.6	 So when Jesus
JHN.18.7	 Then Jesus
JHN.18.8	 Jesus replied,
JHN.18.9	 He said this
JHN.18.10	 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, pulled it out and struck the high priest’s slave,
JHN.18.11	 But Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its sheath! Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?”
JHN.18.12	 Then the squad of soldiers
JHN.18.13	 They
JHN.18.14	 (Now it was Caiaphas who had advised
JHN.18.15	 Simon Peter and another disciple followed them as they brought Jesus to Annas.
JHN.18.16	 But Simon Peter was left standing outside by the door. So the other disciple who was acquainted with the high priest came out and spoke to the slave girl who watched the door,
JHN.18.17	 The girl
JHN.18.18	 (Now the slaves
JHN.18.19	 While this was happening,
JHN.18.20	 Jesus replied,
JHN.18.21	 Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said.
JHN.18.22	 When Jesus
JHN.18.23	 Jesus replied,
JHN.18.24	 Then Annas sent him, still tied up,
JHN.18.25	 Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing in the courtyard
JHN.18.26	 One of the high priest’s slaves,
JHN.18.27	 Then Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.
JHN.18.28	 Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s residence.
JHN.18.29	 So Pilate came outside to them and said, “What accusation
JHN.18.30	 They replied,
JHN.18.31	 Pilate told them,
JHN.18.32	 (This happened
JHN.18.33	 So Pilate went back into the governor’s residence,
JHN.18.34	 Jesus replied,
JHN.18.35	 Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I?
JHN.18.36	 Jesus replied, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my servants would be fighting to keep me from being
JHN.18.37	 Then Pilate said,
JHN.18.38	 Pilate asked,
JHN.18.38	When he had said this he went back outside to the Jewish leaders
JHN.18.39	 But it is your custom that I release one prisoner
JHN.18.40	 Then they shouted back,
JHN.19.1	 Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged severely.
JHN.19.2	 The soldiers
JHN.19.3	 They
JHN.19.4	 Again Pilate went out and said to the Jewish leaders,
JHN.19.5	 So Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe.
JHN.19.6	 When the chief priests and their officers saw him, they shouted out, “Crucify
JHN.19.7	 The Jewish leaders
JHN.19.8	 When Pilate heard what they said,
JHN.19.9	 and he went back into the governor’s residence
JHN.19.10	 So Pilate said,
JHN.19.11	 Jesus replied, “You would have no authority
JHN.19.12	 From this point on, Pilate tried
JHN.19.13	 When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat
JHN.19.14	 (Now it was the day of preparation
JHN.19.15	 Then they
JHN.19.16	 Then Pilate
JHN.19.16	So they took Jesus, 
JHN.19.17	 and carrying his own cross
JHN.19.18	 There they
JHN.19.19	 Pilate also had a notice
JHN.19.20	 Thus many of the Jewish residents of Jerusalem
JHN.19.21	 Then the chief priests of the Jews
JHN.19.22	 Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
JHN.19.23	 Now when the soldiers crucified
JHN.19.24	 So the soldiers said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but throw dice
JHN.19.25	 Now standing beside Jesus’ cross were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
JHN.19.26	 So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman,
JHN.19.27	 He then said to his disciple, “Look, here is your mother!” From that very time
JHN.19.28	 After this Jesus, realizing that by this time
JHN.19.29	 A jar full of sour wine
JHN.19.30	 When
JHN.19.31	 Then, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies should not stay on the crosses on the Sabbath
JHN.19.32	 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men who had been crucified
JHN.19.33	 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 
JHN.19.34	 But one of the soldiers pierced
JHN.19.35	 And the person who saw it
JHN.19.36	 For these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled, “
JHN.19.37	 And again another scripture says, “
JHN.19.38	 After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus (but secretly, because he feared the Jewish leaders
JHN.19.39	 Nicodemus, the man who had previously come to Jesus
JHN.19.40	 Then they took Jesus’ body and wrapped it, with the aromatic spices,
JHN.19.41	 Now at the place where Jesus
JHN.19.42	 And so, because it was the Jewish day of preparation
JHN.20.1	 Now very early on the first day of the week,
JHN.20.2	 So she went running
JHN.20.3	 Then Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb.
JHN.20.4	 The two were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter
JHN.20.5	 He bent down
JHN.20.6	 Then Simon Peter, who had been following him, arrived and went right into the tomb. He saw
JHN.20.7	 and the face cloth,
JHN.20.8	 Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, came in, and he saw and believed.
JHN.20.9	 (For they did not yet understand
JHN.20.10	 So the disciples went back to their homes. 
JHN.20.11	 But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she bent down and looked into the tomb. 
JHN.20.12	 And she saw two angels in white sitting where Jesus’ body had been lying, one at the head and one at the feet. 
JHN.20.13	 They said
JHN.20.14	 When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there,
JHN.20.15	 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” Because she
JHN.20.16	 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She
JHN.20.17	 Jesus replied,
JHN.20.18	 Mary Magdalene came and informed the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them
JHN.20.19	 On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the disciples had gathered together
JHN.20.20	 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
JHN.20.21	 So Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, I also send you.” 
JHN.20.22	 And after he said this, he breathed on them and said,
JHN.20.23	 If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven;
JHN.20.24	 Now Thomas (called Didymus),
JHN.20.25	 The other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he replied,
JHN.20.26	 Eight days later the disciples were again together in the house,
JHN.20.27	 Then he said to Thomas, “Put
JHN.20.28	 Thomas replied to him,
JHN.20.29	 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are the people
JHN.20.30	 Now Jesus performed
JHN.20.31	 But these
JHN.21.1	 After this
JHN.21.2	 Simon Peter, Thomas
JHN.21.3	 Simon Peter told them, “I am going fishing.” “We will go with you,” they replied.
JHN.21.4	 When it was already very early morning, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 
JHN.21.5	 So Jesus said to them, “Children, you don’t have any fish,
JHN.21.6	 He told them, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”
JHN.21.7	 Then the disciple whom
JHN.21.8	 Meanwhile the other disciples came with the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards.
JHN.21.9	 When they got out on the beach,
JHN.21.10	 Jesus said,
JHN.21.11	 So Simon Peter went aboard and pulled the net to shore. It was
JHN.21.12	 “Come, have breakfast,” Jesus said.
JHN.21.13	 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. 
JHN.21.14	 This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.
JHN.21.15	 Then when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John,
JHN.21.16	 Jesus
JHN.21.17	 Jesus
JHN.21.18	 I tell you the solemn truth,
JHN.21.19	 (Now Jesus
JHN.21.20	 Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them.
JHN.21.21	 So when Peter saw him,
JHN.21.22	 Jesus replied,
JHN.21.23	 So the saying circulated
JHN.21.24	 This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true. 
JHN.21.25	 There are many other things that Jesus did. If every one of them were written down,
ACT.1.1	I wrote
ACT.1.2	 until the day he was taken up to heaven,
ACT.1.3	 To the same apostles
ACT.1.4	 While he was with them,
ACT.1.5	 For
ACT.1.6	 So when they had gathered together, they began to ask him,
ACT.1.7	 He told them, “You are not permitted to know
ACT.1.8	 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the farthest parts
ACT.1.9	 After
ACT.1.10	 As
ACT.1.11	 and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand here
ACT.1.12	 Then they returned to Jerusalem
ACT.1.13	 When
ACT.1.14	 All these continued together in prayer with one mind, together with the women, along with Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
ACT.1.15	 In those days
ACT.1.16	 “Brothers,
ACT.1.17	 for he was counted as one of us and received a share in this ministry.”
ACT.1.18	 (Now this man Judas
ACT.1.19	 This
ACT.1.20	 “For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘
ACT.1.21	 Thus one of the men
ACT.1.22	 beginning from his baptism by John until the day he
ACT.1.23	 So they
ACT.1.24	 Then they prayed,
ACT.1.25	 to assume the task
ACT.1.26	 Then
ACT.2.1	 Now
ACT.2.2	 Suddenly
ACT.2.3	 And tongues spreading out like a fire
ACT.2.4	 All
ACT.2.5	 Now there were devout Jews
ACT.2.6	 When this sound
ACT.2.7	 Completely baffled, they said,
ACT.2.8	 And how is it that each one of us hears them
ACT.2.9	 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and the province of Asia,
ACT.2.10	 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene,
ACT.2.11	 both Jews and proselytes,
ACT.2.12	 All were astounded and greatly confused, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” 
ACT.2.13	 But others jeered at the speakers,
ACT.2.14	 But Peter stood up
ACT.2.15	 In spite of what you think, these men are not drunk,
ACT.2.16	 But this is what was spoken about through the prophet Joel:
ACT.2.17	 ‘
ACT.2.17	‘
ACT.2.22	 “Men of Israel,
ACT.2.23	 this man, who was handed over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you executed
ACT.2.24	 But God raised him up,
ACT.2.25	 For David says about him,
ACT.2.25	‘
ACT.2.28	’
ACT.2.29	 “Brothers,
ACT.2.30	 So then, because
ACT.2.31	 David by foreseeing this
ACT.2.32	 This Jesus God raised up, and we are all witnesses of it.
ACT.2.33	 So then, exalted
ACT.2.34	 For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says, 
ACT.2.34	‘
ACT.2.34	“
ACT.2.36	 Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt
ACT.2.37	 Now when they heard this,
ACT.2.38	 Peter said to them, “Repent, and each one of you be baptized
ACT.2.39	 For the promise
ACT.2.40	 With many other words he testified
ACT.2.41	 So those who accepted
ACT.2.42	 They were devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship,
ACT.2.43	 Reverential awe
ACT.2.44	 All who believed were together and held
ACT.2.45	 and they began selling
ACT.2.46	 Every day
ACT.2.47	 praising God and having the good will
ACT.3.1	 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time
ACT.3.2	 And a man lame
ACT.3.3	 When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple courts,
ACT.3.4	 Peter looked directly
ACT.3.5	 So the lame man
ACT.3.6	 But Peter said, “I have no silver or gold,
ACT.3.7	 Then
ACT.3.8	 He
ACT.3.9	 All
ACT.3.10	 and they recognized him as the man who used to sit and ask for donations
ACT.3.11	 While the man
ACT.3.12	 When Peter saw this, he declared to the people, “Men of Israel,
ACT.3.13	 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
ACT.3.14	 But you rejected
ACT.3.15	 You killed
ACT.3.16	 And on the basis of faith in Jesus’
ACT.3.17	 And now, brothers, I know you acted in ignorance,
ACT.3.18	 But the things God foretold
ACT.3.19	 Therefore repent and turn back so that your sins may be wiped out, 
ACT.3.20	 so that times of refreshing
ACT.3.21	 This one
ACT.3.22	 Moses said, ‘
ACT.3.24	 And all the prophets, from Samuel and those who followed him, have spoken about and announced
ACT.3.25	 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors,
ACT.3.26	 God raised up
ACT.4.1	 While Peter and John
ACT.4.2	 angry
ACT.4.3	 So
ACT.4.4	 But many of those who had listened to
ACT.4.5	 On the next day,
ACT.4.6	 Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others who were members of the high priest’s family.
ACT.4.7	 After
ACT.4.8	 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit,
ACT.4.9	 if
ACT.4.10	 let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ
ACT.4.11	 This Jesus
ACT.4.12	 And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among people
ACT.4.13	 When they saw the boldness
ACT.4.14	 And because they saw the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against this.
ACT.4.15	 But when they had ordered them to go outside the council,
ACT.4.16	 saying, “What should we do with these men? For it is plain
ACT.4.17	 But to keep this matter from spreading any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more
ACT.4.18	 And they called them in and ordered
ACT.4.19	 But Peter and John replied,
ACT.4.20	 for it is impossible
ACT.4.21	 After threatening them further, they released them, for they could not find how to punish them on account of the people, because they were all praising
ACT.4.22	 For the man, on whom this miraculous sign
ACT.4.23	 When they were released, Peter and John
ACT.4.24	 When they heard this, they raised their voices to God with one mind
ACT.4.25	 who said by the Holy Spirit through
ACT.4.25	‘
ACT.4.26	’
ACT.4.27	 “For indeed both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, assembled together in this city against
ACT.4.28	 to do as much as your power
ACT.4.29	 And now, Lord, pay attention to
ACT.4.30	 while you extend your hand to heal, and to bring about miraculous signs
ACT.4.31	 When
ACT.4.32	 The group of those who believed were of one heart and mind,
ACT.4.33	 With
ACT.4.34	 For there was no one needy
ACT.4.35	 and placing them at the apostles’ feet. The proceeds
ACT.4.36	 So Joseph, a Levite who was a native of Cyprus, called by the apostles Barnabas (which is translated “son of encouragement”),
ACT.4.37	 sold
ACT.5.1	 Now a man named Ananias, together with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property. 
ACT.5.2	 He
ACT.5.3	 But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled
ACT.5.4	 Before it was sold,
ACT.5.5	 When Ananias heard these words he collapsed and died, and great fear gripped
ACT.5.6	 So the young men came,
ACT.5.7	 After an interval of about three hours,
ACT.5.8	 Peter said to her, “Tell me, were the two of you
ACT.5.9	 Peter then told her, “Why have you agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out!” 
ACT.5.10	 At once
ACT.5.11	 Great
ACT.5.12	 Now many miraculous signs
ACT.5.13	 None of the rest dared to join them,
ACT.5.14	 More and more believers in the Lord were added to their number,
ACT.5.15	 Thus
ACT.5.16	 A crowd of people from the towns around Jerusalem
ACT.5.17	 Now the high priest rose up, and all those with him (that is, the religious party of the Sadducees
ACT.5.18	 They
ACT.5.19	 But during the night an angel of the Lord
ACT.5.20	 “Go and stand in the temple courts
ACT.5.21	 When they heard this, they entered the temple courts
ACT.5.21	Now when the high priest and those who were with him arrived, they summoned the Sanhedrin
ACT.5.22	 But the officers
ACT.5.23	 “We found the jail locked securely and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them,
ACT.5.24	 Now when the commander
ACT.5.25	 But someone came and reported to them, “Look! The men you put in prison are standing in the temple courts
ACT.5.26	 Then the commander
ACT.5.27	 When they had brought them, they stood them before the council,
ACT.5.28	 saying, “We gave
ACT.5.29	 But Peter and the apostles replied,
ACT.5.30	 The God of our forefathers
ACT.5.31	 God exalted him
ACT.5.32	 And we are witnesses of these events,
ACT.5.33	 Now when they heard this, they became furious
ACT.5.34	 But a Pharisee
ACT.5.35	 Then he said to the council,
ACT.5.36	 For some time ago
ACT.5.37	 After him Judas the Galilean arose in the days of the census,
ACT.5.38	 So in this case I say to you, stay away from these men and leave them alone, because if this plan or this undertaking originates with people,
ACT.5.39	 but if
ACT.5.40	 and they summoned the apostles and had them beaten.
ACT.5.41	 So they left the council rejoicing because they had been considered worthy
ACT.5.42	 And every day both in the temple courts
ACT.6.1	 Now in those
ACT.6.2	 So the twelve
ACT.6.3	 But carefully select from among you, brothers,
ACT.6.4	 But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” 
ACT.6.5	 The
ACT.6.6	 They stood these men before the apostles, who prayed
ACT.6.7	 The word of God continued to spread,
ACT.6.8	 Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and miraculous signs
ACT.6.9	 But some men from the Synagogue
ACT.6.10	 Yet
ACT.6.11	 Then they secretly instigated
ACT.6.12	 They incited the people, the
ACT.6.13	 They brought forward false witnesses who said, “This man does not stop saying things against this holy place
ACT.6.14	 For we have heard him saying that Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and change the customs
ACT.6.15	 All
ACT.7.1	 Then the high priest said, “Are these things true?”
ACT.7.2	 So he replied,
ACT.7.3	 and said to him, ‘
ACT.7.4	 Then he went out from the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God

ACT.7.12	 So when Jacob heard that there was grain
ACT.7.13	 On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers again, and Joseph’s family
ACT.7.14	 So Joseph sent a message
ACT.7.15	 So Jacob went down to Egypt and died there,
ACT.7.16	 and their bones
ACT.7.17	 “But as the time drew near for God to fulfill the promise he had declared to Abraham,
ACT.7.18	 until 
ACT.7.19	 This was the one who exploited
ACT.7.20	 At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful
ACT.7.21	 and when he had been abandoned,
ACT.7.22	 So Moses was trained
ACT.7.23	 But when he was about forty years old, it entered his mind
ACT.7.24	 When
ACT.7.25	 He thought his own people
ACT.7.26	 The next day Moses
ACT.7.27	 But the man who was unfairly hurting his neighbor pushed
ACT.7.29	 When the man said this,
ACT.7.30	 “After

ACT.7.32	 ‘
ACT.7.35	 This same
ACT.7.36	 This man led them out, performing wonders and miraculous signs

ACT.7.53	 You
ACT.7.54	 When they heard these things, they became furious
ACT.7.55	 But Stephen,
ACT.7.56	 “Look!” he said.
ACT.7.57	 But they covered their ears,
ACT.7.58	 When
ACT.7.59	 They
ACT.7.60	 Then he fell
ACT.8.1	 And Saul agreed completely with killing
ACT.8.1	Now on that day a great
ACT.8.2	 Some
ACT.8.3	 But Saul was trying to destroy
ACT.8.4	 Now those who had been forced to scatter went around proclaiming the good news of the word. 
ACT.8.5	 Philip went down to the main city of Samaria
ACT.8.6	 The crowds were paying attention with one mind to what Philip said,
ACT.8.7	 For unclean spirits,
ACT.8.8	 So there was
ACT.8.9	 Now in that city was a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic
ACT.8.10	 All the people,
ACT.8.11	 And they paid close attention to him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic. 
ACT.8.12	 But when they believed Philip as he was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God
ACT.8.13	 Even Simon himself believed, and after he was baptized, he stayed close to
ACT.8.14	 Now when the apostles in Jerusalem
ACT.8.15	 These two
ACT.8.16	 (For the Spirit
ACT.8.17	 Then Peter and John placed their hands on the Samaritans,
ACT.8.18	 Now Simon, when he saw that the Spirit
ACT.8.19	 saying, “Give me this power
ACT.8.20	 But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you,
ACT.8.21	 You have no share or part
ACT.8.22	 Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord
ACT.8.23	 For I see that you are bitterly envious
ACT.8.24	 But Simon replied,
ACT.8.25	 So after Peter and John
ACT.8.26	 Then an angel of the Lord
ACT.8.27	 So
ACT.8.28	 and was returning home, sitting
ACT.8.29	 Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.” 
ACT.8.30	 So Philip ran up
ACT.8.31	 The man
ACT.8.32	 Now the passage of scripture the man
ACT.8.32	“
ACT.8.33	”
ACT.8.34	 Then the eunuch said
ACT.8.35	 So Philip started speaking,
ACT.8.36	 Now as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “Look, there is water! What is to stop me
ACT.8.38	 So he ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water,
ACT.8.39	 Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any more, but
ACT.8.40	 Philip, however, found himself
ACT.9.1	 Meanwhile Saul, still breathing out threats
ACT.9.2	 and requested letters from him to the synagogues
ACT.9.3	 As he was going along, approaching
ACT.9.4	 He
ACT.9.5	 So he said, “Who are you, Lord?” He replied, “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting! 
ACT.9.6	 But stand up
ACT.9.7	 (Now the men
ACT.9.8	 So Saul got up from the ground, but although his eyes were open,
ACT.9.9	 For
ACT.9.10	 Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The
ACT.9.11	 Then the Lord told him, “Get up and go to the street called ‘Straight,’
ACT.9.12	 and he has seen in a vision
ACT.9.13	 But Ananias replied,
ACT.9.14	 and here he has authority from the chief priests to imprison
ACT.9.15	 But the Lord said to him, “Go, because this man is my chosen instrument
ACT.9.16	 For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.”
ACT.9.17	 So Ananias departed and entered the house, placed
ACT.9.18	 Immediately
ACT.9.19	 and after taking some food, his strength returned.
ACT.9.19	For several days
ACT.9.20	 and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues,
ACT.9.21	 All
ACT.9.22	 But Saul became more and more capable,
ACT.9.23	 Now after some days had passed, the Jews plotted
ACT.9.24	 but Saul learned of their plot against him.
ACT.9.25	 But his disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening
ACT.9.26	 When he arrived in Jerusalem,
ACT.9.27	 But Barnabas took
ACT.9.28	 So he was staying with them, associating openly with them
ACT.9.29	 He was speaking and debating
ACT.9.30	 When the brothers found out about this, they brought him down to Caesarea
ACT.9.31	 Then
ACT.9.32	 Now
ACT.9.33	 He found there a man named Aeneas who had been confined to a mattress for eight years because
ACT.9.34	 Peter
ACT.9.35	 All
ACT.9.36	 Now in Joppa
ACT.9.37	 At that time
ACT.9.38	 Because Lydda
ACT.9.39	 So Peter got up and went with them, and
ACT.9.40	 But Peter sent them all outside,
ACT.9.41	 He gave
ACT.9.42	 This became known throughout all
ACT.9.43	 So
ACT.10.1	 Now there was a man in Caesarea
ACT.10.2	 He
ACT.10.3	 About three o’clock one afternoon
ACT.10.4	 Staring at him and becoming greatly afraid, Cornelius
ACT.10.5	 Now
ACT.10.6	 This man is staying as a guest with a man named Simon, a tanner,
ACT.10.7	 When the angel who had spoken to him departed, Cornelius
ACT.10.8	 and when he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	 About noon
ACT.10.10	 He became hungry and wanted to eat, but while they were preparing the meal, a trance came over him.
ACT.10.11	 He
ACT.10.12	 In it
ACT.10.13	 Then
ACT.10.14	 But Peter said, “Certainly not, Lord, for I have never eaten anything defiled and ritually unclean!”
ACT.10.15	 The voice
ACT.10.16	 This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into heaven.
ACT.10.17	 Now while Peter was puzzling over
ACT.10.18	 They
ACT.10.19	 While Peter was still thinking seriously about
ACT.10.20	 But get up,
ACT.10.21	 So Peter went down
ACT.10.22	 They said, “Cornelius the centurion,
ACT.10.23	 So Peter
ACT.10.23	On the next day he got up and set out
ACT.10.24	 The following day
ACT.10.25	 So when
ACT.10.26	 But Peter helped him up,
ACT.10.27	 Peter
ACT.10.28	 He said to them, “You know that
ACT.10.29	 Therefore when you sent for me,
ACT.10.30	 Cornelius
ACT.10.31	 and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your acts of charity
ACT.10.32	 Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter. This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon the tanner,
ACT.10.33	 Therefore I sent for you at once, and you were kind enough to come.
ACT.10.34	 Then Peter started speaking:
ACT.10.35	 but in every nation
ACT.10.36	 You know
ACT.10.37	 you know what happened throughout Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John announced:
ACT.10.38	 with respect to Jesus from Nazareth,
ACT.10.39	 We
ACT.10.40	 but
ACT.10.41	 not by all the people, but by us, the witnesses God had already chosen,
ACT.10.42	 He
ACT.10.43	 About him all the prophets testify,
ACT.10.44	 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on
ACT.10.45	 The
ACT.10.46	 for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising
ACT.10.47	 “No one can withhold the water for these people to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did,
ACT.10.48	 So he gave orders to have them baptized
ACT.11.1	 Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles too had accepted
ACT.11.2	 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem,
ACT.11.3	 saying, “You went to
ACT.11.4	 But Peter began and explained it to them point by point,
ACT.11.5	 “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision,
ACT.11.6	 As I stared
ACT.11.7	 I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; slaughter
ACT.11.8	 But I said, ‘Certainly not, Lord, for nothing defiled or ritually unclean
ACT.11.9	 But the voice replied a second time from heaven, ‘What God has made clean, you must not consider
ACT.11.10	 This happened three times, and then everything was pulled up to heaven again. 
ACT.11.11	 At that very moment,
ACT.11.12	 The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers
ACT.11.13	 He informed us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter, 
ACT.11.14	 who will speak a message
ACT.11.15	 Then as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on
ACT.11.16	 And I remembered the word of the Lord,
ACT.11.17	 Therefore if God
ACT.11.18	 When they heard this,
ACT.11.19	 Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen
ACT.11.20	 But there were some men from Cyprus
ACT.11.21	 The
ACT.11.22	 A report
ACT.11.23	 When
ACT.11.24	 because he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and a significant number of people
ACT.11.25	 Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to look for Saul, 
ACT.11.26	 and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch.
ACT.11.27	 At that time
ACT.11.28	 One of them, named Agabus, got up
ACT.11.29	 So the disciples, each in accordance with his financial ability,
ACT.11.30	 They did so,
ACT.12.1	 About that time King Herod
ACT.12.2	 He had James, the brother of John, executed with a sword.
ACT.12.3	 When he saw that this pleased the Jews,
ACT.12.4	 When he had seized him, he put him in prison, handing him over to four squads
ACT.12.5	 So Peter was kept in prison, but those in the church were earnestly
ACT.12.6	 On that very night before Herod was going to bring him out for trial,
ACT.12.7	 Suddenly
ACT.12.8	 The angel said to him, “Fasten your belt
ACT.12.9	 Peter
ACT.12.10	 After they had passed the first and second guards,
ACT.12.11	 When
ACT.12.12	 When Peter
ACT.12.13	 When he knocked at the door of the outer gate, a slave girl named Rhoda answered.
ACT.12.14	 When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed she did not open the gate, but ran back in and told
ACT.12.15	 But they said to her, “You’ve lost your mind!”
ACT.12.16	 Now Peter continued knocking, and when they opened the door
ACT.12.17	 He motioned to them
ACT.12.18	 At daybreak
ACT.12.19	 When Herod
ACT.12.20	 Now Herod
ACT.12.21	 On a day determined in advance, Herod
ACT.12.22	 But the crowd
ACT.12.23	 Immediately an angel of the Lord
ACT.12.24	 But the word of God
ACT.12.25	 So Barnabas and Saul returned to
ACT.13.1	 Now there were these prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch:
ACT.13.2	 While they were serving
ACT.13.3	 Then, after they had fasted
ACT.13.4	 So Barnabas and Saul,
ACT.13.5	 When
ACT.13.6	 When they had crossed over
ACT.13.7	 who was with the proconsul
ACT.13.8	 But the magician Elymas
ACT.13.9	 But Saul (also known as Paul),
ACT.13.10	 and said, “You who are full of all deceit and all wrongdoing,
ACT.13.11	 Now
ACT.13.12	 Then when the proconsul
ACT.13.13	 Then Paul and his companions put out to sea
ACT.13.14	 Moving on from
ACT.13.15	 After the reading from the law and the prophets,
ACT.13.16	 So Paul stood up,
ACT.13.16	“Men of Israel,
ACT.13.17	 The God of this people Israel
ACT.13.18	 For
ACT.13.19	 After
ACT.13.20	 All this took
ACT.13.21	 Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled
ACT.13.22	 After removing him, God
ACT.13.23	 From the descendants
ACT.13.24	 Before
ACT.13.25	 But while John was completing his mission,
ACT.13.26	 Brothers,
ACT.13.27	 For the people who live in Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize
ACT.13.28	 Though
ACT.13.29	 When they had accomplished
ACT.13.30	 But God raised
ACT.13.31	 and
ACT.13.32	 And we proclaim to you the good news about the promise to our ancestors,
ACT.13.33	 that this promise
ACT.13.34	 But regarding the fact that he has raised Jesus
ACT.13.35	 Therefore he also says in another psalm,
ACT.13.36	 For David, after he had served
ACT.13.37	 but the one
ACT.13.38	 Therefore let it be known to you, brothers, that through this one
ACT.13.39	 and by this one
ACT.13.40	 Watch out,
ACT.13.41	 ‘
ACT.13.41	’”
ACT.13.42	 As Paul and Barnabas
ACT.13.43	 When the meeting of the synagogue
ACT.13.44	 On the next Sabbath almost the whole city assembled together to hear the word of the Lord.
ACT.13.45	 But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy,
ACT.13.46	 Both Paul and Barnabas replied courageously,
ACT.13.47	 For this
ACT.13.48	 When the Gentiles heard this, they began to rejoice
ACT.13.49	 So the word of the Lord was spreading
ACT.13.50	 But the Jews incited
ACT.13.51	 So after they shook
ACT.13.52	 And the disciples were filled with joy
ACT.14.1	 The same thing happened in Iconium
ACT.14.2	 But the Jews who refused to believe
ACT.14.3	 So they stayed there
ACT.14.4	 But the population
ACT.14.5	 When both the Gentiles and the Jews (together with their rulers) made
ACT.14.6	 Paul and Barnabas
ACT.14.7	 There
ACT.14.8	 In
ACT.14.9	 This man was listening to Paul as he was speaking. When Paul
ACT.14.10	 he said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.”
ACT.14.11	 So when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted
ACT.14.12	 They began to call
ACT.14.13	 The priest of the temple
ACT.14.14	 But when the apostles
ACT.14.15	 “Men, why are you doing these things? We too are men, with human natures
ACT.14.16	 In
ACT.14.17	 yet he did not leave himself without a witness by doing good,
ACT.14.18	 Even by saying
ACT.14.19	 But Jews came from Antioch
ACT.14.20	 But after the disciples had surrounded him, he got up and went back
ACT.14.21	 After they had proclaimed the good news in that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra,
ACT.14.22	 They strengthened
ACT.14.23	 When they had appointed elders
ACT.14.24	 Then they passed through
ACT.14.25	 and when they had spoken the word
ACT.14.26	 From there they sailed back to Antioch,
ACT.14.27	 When they arrived and gathered the church together, they reported
ACT.14.28	 So they spent
ACT.15.1	 Now some men came down from Judea
ACT.15.2	 When Paul and Barnabas had a major argument and debate
ACT.15.3	 So they were sent on their way by the church, and as they passed through both Phoenicia
ACT.15.4	 When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received
ACT.15.5	 But some from the religious party of the Pharisees
ACT.15.6	 Both the apostles and the elders met together to deliberate
ACT.15.7	 After there had been much debate,
ACT.15.8	 And God, who knows the heart,
ACT.15.9	 and he made no distinction
ACT.15.10	 So now why are you putting God to the test
ACT.15.11	 On the contrary, we believe that we are saved through
ACT.15.12	 The whole group kept quiet
ACT.15.13	 After they stopped speaking,
ACT.15.14	 Simeon
ACT.15.15	 The
ACT.15.16	 ‘
ACT.15.17	’
ACT.15.19	 “Therefore I conclude
ACT.15.20	 but that we should write them a letter
ACT.15.21	 For Moses has had those who proclaim him in every town from ancient times,
ACT.15.22	 Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided
ACT.15.23	 They sent this letter with them:
ACT.15.23	From the apostles
ACT.15.24	 Since we have heard that some have gone out from among us with no orders from us and have confused
ACT.15.25	 we have unanimously
ACT.15.26	 who
ACT.15.27	 Therefore we are sending
ACT.15.28	 For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit and to us
ACT.15.29	 that you abstain from meat that has been sacrificed to idols
ACT.15.30	 So when they were dismissed,
ACT.15.31	 When they read it aloud,
ACT.15.32	 Both Judas and Silas, who were prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with a long speech.
ACT.15.33	 After
ACT.15.35	 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch,
ACT.15.36	 After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s return
ACT.15.37	 Barnabas wanted to bring John called Mark along with them too, 
ACT.15.38	 but Paul insisted
ACT.15.39	 They had
ACT.15.40	 but Paul chose Silas and set out, commended
ACT.15.41	 He passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening
ACT.16.1	 He also came to Derbe
ACT.16.2	 The brothers in Lystra
ACT.16.3	 Paul wanted Timothy
ACT.16.4	 As they went through the towns,
ACT.16.5	 So the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were increasing in number every day.
ACT.16.6	 They went through the region of Phrygia
ACT.16.7	 When they came to
ACT.16.8	 so they passed through
ACT.16.9	 A
ACT.16.10	 After Paul
ACT.16.11	 We put out to sea
ACT.16.12	 and from there to Philippi,
ACT.16.13	 On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate to the side of the river, where we thought there would be a place of prayer, and we sat down
ACT.16.14	 A
ACT.16.15	 After she and her household were baptized, she urged us,
ACT.16.16	 Now
ACT.16.17	 She followed behind Paul and us and kept crying out,
ACT.16.18	 She continued to do this for many days. But Paul became greatly annoyed,
ACT.16.19	 But when her owners
ACT.16.20	 When
ACT.16.21	 and are advocating
ACT.16.22	 The crowd joined the attack
ACT.16.23	 After they had beaten them severely,
ACT.16.24	 Receiving such orders, he threw them in the inner cell
ACT.16.25	 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying
ACT.16.26	 Suddenly a great earthquake occurred, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Immediately all the doors flew open, and the bonds
ACT.16.27	 When the jailer woke up
ACT.16.28	 But Paul called out loudly,
ACT.16.29	 Calling for lights, the jailer
ACT.16.30	 Then he brought them outside
ACT.16.31	 They replied,
ACT.16.32	 Then
ACT.16.33	 At
ACT.16.34	 The jailer
ACT.16.35	 At daybreak
ACT.16.36	 The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying,
ACT.16.37	 But Paul said to the police officers,
ACT.16.38	 The police officers reported these words to the magistrates. They were frightened when they heard Paul and Silas
ACT.16.39	 and came
ACT.16.40	 When they came out of the prison, they entered Lydia’s house, and when they saw the brothers, they encouraged them and then
ACT.17.1	 After they traveled through
ACT.17.2	 Paul went to the Jews in the synagogue,
ACT.17.3	 explaining and demonstrating
ACT.17.4	 Some of them were persuaded
ACT.17.5	 But the Jews became jealous,
ACT.17.6	 When they did not find them, they dragged
ACT.17.7	 and
ACT.17.8	 They caused confusion among
ACT.17.9	 After
ACT.17.10	 The brothers sent Paul and Silas off to Berea
ACT.17.11	 These Jews
ACT.17.12	 Therefore many of them believed, along with quite a few
ACT.17.13	 But when the Jews from Thessalonica
ACT.17.14	 Then the brothers sent Paul away to the coast
ACT.17.15	 Those who accompanied Paul escorted him as far as Athens,
ACT.17.16	 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens,
ACT.17.17	 So he was addressing
ACT.17.18	 Also some of the Epicurean
ACT.17.19	 So they took Paul and
ACT.17.20	 For you are bringing some surprising things
ACT.17.21	 (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there used to spend their time
ACT.17.22	 So Paul stood
ACT.17.23	 For as I went around and observed closely your objects of worship,
ACT.17.24	 The God who made the world and everything in it,
ACT.17.25	 nor is he served by human hands, as if he needed anything,
ACT.17.26	 From one man
ACT.17.27	 so that they would search for God and perhaps grope around
ACT.17.28	 For in him we live and move about
ACT.17.29	 So since we are God’s offspring, we should not think the deity
ACT.17.30	 Therefore, although God has overlooked
ACT.17.31	 because he has set
ACT.17.32	 Now when they heard about
ACT.17.33	 So Paul left the Areopagus.
ACT.17.34	 But some people
ACT.18.1	 After this
ACT.18.2	 There he
ACT.18.3	 and because he worked at the same trade, he stayed with them and worked with them
ACT.18.4	 He addressed
ACT.18.5	 Now when Silas and Timothy arrived
ACT.18.6	 When they opposed him
ACT.18.7	 Then Paul
ACT.18.8	 Crispus, the president of the synagogue,
ACT.18.9	 The Lord said to Paul by a vision
ACT.18.10	 because I am with you, and no one will assault
ACT.18.11	 So he stayed there
ACT.18.12	 Now while Gallio
ACT.18.13	 saying, “This man is persuading
ACT.18.14	 But just as Paul was about to speak,
ACT.18.15	 but since it concerns points of disagreement
ACT.18.16	 Then he had them forced away
ACT.18.17	 So they all seized Sosthenes, the president of the synagogue,
ACT.18.18	 Paul, after staying
ACT.18.19	 When they reached Ephesus,
ACT.18.20	 When they asked him to stay longer, he would not consent,
ACT.18.21	 but said farewell to
ACT.18.22	 and when he arrived
ACT.18.23	 After he spent
ACT.18.24	 Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, arrived in Ephesus.
ACT.18.25	 He had been instructed in
ACT.18.26	 He began to speak out fearlessly
ACT.18.27	 When Apollos
ACT.18.28	 for he refuted the Jews vigorously
ACT.19.1	 While
ACT.19.2	 and said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”
ACT.19.3	 So Paul
ACT.19.4	 Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him,
ACT.19.5	 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, 
ACT.19.6	 and when Paul placed
ACT.19.7	 (Now there were about twelve men in all.)
ACT.19.8	 So Paul
ACT.19.9	 But when
ACT.19.10	 This went on for two years, so that all who lived in the province of Asia,
ACT.19.11	 God was performing extraordinary
ACT.19.12	 so that when even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body
ACT.19.13	 But some itinerant
ACT.19.14	 (Now seven sons of a man named
ACT.19.15	 But the evil spirit replied to them,
ACT.19.16	 Then the man who was possessed by
ACT.19.17	 This became known to all who lived in Ephesus,
ACT.19.18	 Many of those who had believed came forward,
ACT.19.19	 Large numbers
ACT.19.20	 In this way the word of the Lord
ACT.19.21	 Now after all these things had taken place,
ACT.19.22	 So after sending
ACT.19.23	 At
ACT.19.24	 For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines
ACT.19.25	 He gathered
ACT.19.26	 And you see and hear that this Paul has persuaded
ACT.19.27	 There is danger not only that this business of ours will come into disrepute,
ACT.19.28	 When
ACT.19.29	 The
ACT.19.30	 But when Paul wanted to enter the public assembly,
ACT.19.31	 Even some of the provincial authorities
ACT.19.32	 So then some were shouting one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had met together.
ACT.19.33	 Some of the crowd concluded
ACT.19.34	 But when they recognized
ACT.19.35	 After the city secretary
ACT.19.36	 So because these facts
ACT.19.37	 For you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers
ACT.19.38	 If then Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint
ACT.19.39	 But if you want anything in addition,
ACT.19.40	 For
ACT.19.41	 After
ACT.20.1	 After the disturbance had ended, Paul sent for the disciples, and after encouraging
ACT.20.2	 After he had gone through those regions
ACT.20.3	 where he stayed
ACT.20.4	 Paul
ACT.20.5	 These had gone on ahead
ACT.20.6	 We
ACT.20.7	 On the first day
ACT.20.8	 (Now there were many lamps
ACT.20.9	 A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in the window,
ACT.20.10	 But Paul went down,
ACT.20.11	 Then Paul
ACT.20.12	 They took the boy home alive and were greatly
ACT.20.13	 We went on ahead
ACT.20.14	 When he met us in Assos,
ACT.20.15	 We set sail
ACT.20.16	 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus
ACT.20.17	 From Miletus
ACT.20.18	 When they arrived, he said to them, “You yourselves know how I lived
ACT.20.19	 serving the Lord with all humility
ACT.20.20	 You know that I did not hold back from proclaiming
ACT.20.21	 testifying
ACT.20.22	 And now,
ACT.20.23	 except
ACT.20.24	 But I do not consider my life
ACT.20.25	 “And now
ACT.20.26	 Therefore I declare
ACT.20.27	 For I did not hold back from
ACT.20.28	 Watch out for
ACT.20.29	 I know that after I am gone
ACT.20.30	 Even from among your own group
ACT.20.31	 Therefore be alert,
ACT.20.32	 And now I entrust
ACT.20.33	 I have desired
ACT.20.34	 You yourselves know that these hands of mine
ACT.20.35	 By all these things,
ACT.20.36	 When
ACT.20.37	 They all began to weep loudly,
ACT.20.38	 especially saddened
ACT.21.1	 After
ACT.21.2	 We found
ACT.21.3	 After we sighted Cyprus
ACT.21.4	 After we located
ACT.21.5	 When
ACT.21.6	 we said farewell
ACT.21.7	 We continued the voyage from Tyre
ACT.21.8	 On the next day we left
ACT.21.9	 (He had four unmarried
ACT.21.10	 While we remained there for a number of days,
ACT.21.11	 He came
ACT.21.12	 When we heard this, both we and the local people
ACT.21.13	 Then Paul replied, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking
ACT.21.14	 Because he could not be persuaded,
ACT.21.15	 After these days we got ready
ACT.21.16	 Some of the disciples from Caesarea
ACT.21.17	 When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.
ACT.21.18	 The next day Paul went in with us to see James, and all the elders were there.
ACT.21.19	 When Paul
ACT.21.20	 When they heard this, they praised
ACT.21.21	 They have been informed about you – that you teach all the Jews now living
ACT.21.22	 What then should we do? They will no doubt
ACT.21.23	 So do what
ACT.21.24	 take them and purify
ACT.21.25	 But regarding the Gentiles who have believed, we have written a letter, having decided
ACT.21.26	 Then Paul took the men the next day,
ACT.21.27	 When the seven days were almost over,
ACT.21.28	 shouting, “Men of Israel,
ACT.21.29	 (For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him previously, and
ACT.21.30	 The whole city was stirred up,
ACT.21.31	 While they were trying
ACT.21.32	 He
ACT.21.33	 Then the commanding officer
ACT.21.34	 But some in the crowd shouted one thing, and others something else,
ACT.21.35	 When he came to the steps, Paul
ACT.21.36	 for a crowd of people
ACT.21.37	 As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks,
ACT.21.38	 Then you’re not that Egyptian who started a rebellion
ACT.21.39	 Paul answered,
ACT.21.40	 When the commanding officer
ACT.22.1	 “Brothers and fathers, listen to my defense
ACT.22.2	 (When they heard
ACT.22.3	 “I am a Jew,
ACT.22.4	 I
ACT.22.5	 as both the high priest and the whole council of elders
ACT.22.6	 As
ACT.22.7	 Then I
ACT.22.8	 I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ He said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.’ 
ACT.22.9	 Those who were with me saw the light, but did not understand
ACT.22.10	 So I asked,
ACT.22.11	 Since I could not see because of
ACT.22.12	 A man named Ananias,
ACT.22.13	 came
ACT.22.14	 Then he said, ‘The God of our ancestors
ACT.22.15	 because you will be his witness
ACT.22.16	 And now what are you waiting for?
ACT.22.17	 When
ACT.22.18	 and saw the Lord
ACT.22.19	 I replied,
ACT.22.20	 And when the blood of your witness
ACT.22.21	 Then
ACT.22.22	 The crowd
ACT.22.23	 While they were screaming
ACT.22.24	 the commanding officer
ACT.22.25	 When they had stretched him out for the lash,
ACT.22.26	 When the centurion
ACT.22.27	 So the commanding officer
ACT.22.28	 The commanding officer
ACT.22.29	 Then those who were about to interrogate him stayed away
ACT.22.30	 The next day, because the commanding officer
ACT.23.1	 Paul looked directly
ACT.23.2	 At that
ACT.23.3	 Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall!
ACT.23.4	 Those standing near him
ACT.23.5	 Paul replied,
ACT.23.6	 Then when Paul noticed
ACT.23.7	 When he said this,
ACT.23.8	 (For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, or angel, or spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.)
ACT.23.9	 There was a great commotion,
ACT.23.10	 When the argument became
ACT.23.11	 The following night the Lord
ACT.23.12	 When morning came,
ACT.23.13	 There were more than forty of them who formed this conspiracy.
ACT.23.14	 They
ACT.23.15	 So now you and the council
ACT.23.16	 But when the son of Paul’s sister heard about the ambush,
ACT.23.17	 Paul called
ACT.23.18	 So the centurion
ACT.23.19	 The commanding officer
ACT.23.20	 He replied,
ACT.23.21	 So do not let them persuade you to do this,
ACT.23.22	 Then the commanding officer
ACT.23.23	 Then
ACT.23.24	 and provide mounts for Paul to ride
ACT.23.25	 He wrote
ACT.23.31	 So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders,
ACT.23.32	 The next day they let
ACT.23.33	 When the horsemen
ACT.23.34	 When the governor
ACT.23.35	 he said, “I will give you a hearing
ACT.24.1	 After five days the high priest Ananias
ACT.24.2	 When Paul
ACT.24.3	 Most excellent Felix,
ACT.24.4	 But so that I may not delay
ACT.24.5	 For we have found
ACT.24.6	 He
ACT.24.8	 When you examine
ACT.24.9	 The Jews also joined in the verbal attack,
ACT.24.10	 When the governor gestured for him to speak, Paul replied, “Because I know
ACT.24.11	 As you can verify
ACT.24.12	 They did not find me arguing
ACT.24.13	 nor can they prove
ACT.24.14	 But I confess this to you, that I worship
ACT.24.15	 I have
ACT.24.16	 This is the reason
ACT.24.17	 After several years
ACT.24.18	 which I was doing when they found me in the temple, ritually purified,
ACT.24.19	 But there are some Jews from the province of Asia
ACT.24.20	 Or these men here
ACT.24.21	 other than
ACT.24.22	 Then Felix,
ACT.24.23	 He ordered the centurion
ACT.24.24	 Some days later, when Felix
ACT.24.25	 While Paul
ACT.24.26	 At the same time he was also hoping that Paul would give him money,
ACT.24.27	 After two years
ACT.25.1	 Now
ACT.25.2	 So the chief priests and the most prominent men
ACT.25.3	 Requesting him to do them a favor against Paul,
ACT.25.4	 Then Festus
ACT.25.5	 “So,” he said, “let your leaders
ACT.25.6	 After Festus
ACT.25.7	 When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him,
ACT.25.8	 Paul said in his defense,
ACT.25.9	 But Festus,
ACT.25.10	 Paul replied,
ACT.25.11	 If then I am in the wrong
ACT.25.12	 Then, after conferring with his council,
ACT.25.13	 After several days had passed, King Agrippa
ACT.25.14	 While
ACT.25.15	 When I was in Jerusalem,
ACT.25.16	 I answered them
ACT.25.17	 So after they came back here with me,
ACT.25.18	 When his accusers stood up, they did not charge
ACT.25.19	 Rather they had several points of disagreement
ACT.25.20	 Because I was at a loss
ACT.25.21	 But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of His Majesty the Emperor,
ACT.25.22	 Agrippa
ACT.25.23	 So the next day Agrippa
ACT.25.24	 Then Festus
ACT.25.25	 But I found that he had done nothing that deserved death,
ACT.25.26	 But I have nothing definite
ACT.25.27	 For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without clearly indicating
ACT.26.1	 So Agrippa
ACT.26.2	 “Regarding all the things I have been accused of by the Jews, King Agrippa,
ACT.26.3	 because you are especially
ACT.26.4	 Now all the Jews know the way I lived
ACT.26.5	 They know,
ACT.26.6	 And now I stand here on trial
ACT.26.7	 a promise
ACT.26.8	 Why do you people
ACT.26.9	 Of course,
ACT.26.10	 And that is what I did in Jerusalem: Not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons by the authority I received
ACT.26.11	 I punished
ACT.26.12	 “While doing this very thing,
ACT.26.13	 about noon along the road, Your Majesty,
ACT.26.14	 When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic,
ACT.26.15	 So I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord replied,
ACT.26.16	 But get up and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this reason, to designate you in advance
ACT.26.17	 I will rescue
ACT.26.18	 to open their eyes so that they turn
ACT.26.19	 “Therefore, King Agrippa,
ACT.26.20	 but I declared to those in Damascus first, and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea,
ACT.26.21	 For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple courts
ACT.26.22	 I have experienced
ACT.26.23	 that
ACT.26.24	 As Paul
ACT.26.25	 But Paul replied,
ACT.26.26	 For the king knows about these things, and I am speaking freely
ACT.26.27	 Do you believe the prophets,
ACT.26.28	 Agrippa
ACT.26.29	 Paul replied, “I pray to God that whether in a short or a long time
ACT.26.30	 So the king got up, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them, 
ACT.26.31	 and as they were leaving they said to one another,
ACT.26.32	 Agrippa
ACT.27.1	 When it was decided we
ACT.27.2	 We went on board
ACT.27.3	 The next day we put in
ACT.27.4	 From there we put out to sea
ACT.27.5	 After we had sailed across the open sea
ACT.27.6	 There the centurion
ACT.27.7	 We sailed slowly
ACT.27.8	 With difficulty we sailed along the coast
ACT.27.9	 Since considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous
ACT.27.10	 “Men, I can see the voyage is going to end
ACT.27.11	 But the centurion
ACT.27.12	 Because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided
ACT.27.13	 When a gentle south wind sprang up, they thought
ACT.27.14	 Not long after this, a hurricane-force
ACT.27.15	 When the ship was caught in it
ACT.27.16	 As we ran under the lee of
ACT.27.17	 After the crew
ACT.27.18	 The next day, because we were violently battered by the storm,
ACT.27.19	 and on the third day they threw the ship’s gear
ACT.27.20	 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a violent
ACT.27.21	 Since many of them had no desire to eat,
ACT.27.22	 And now I advise
ACT.27.23	 For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong
ACT.27.24	 and said,
ACT.27.25	 Therefore keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God
ACT.27.26	 But we must
ACT.27.27	 When the fourteenth night had come, while we were being driven
ACT.27.28	 They took soundings
ACT.27.29	 Because they were afraid
ACT.27.30	 Then when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and were lowering the ship’s boat into the sea, pretending
ACT.27.31	 Paul said to the centurion
ACT.27.32	 Then the soldiers cut the ropes
ACT.27.33	 As day was about to dawn,
ACT.27.34	 Therefore I urge you to take some food, for this is important
ACT.27.35	 After he said this, Paul
ACT.27.36	 So all of them were encouraged and took food themselves. 
ACT.27.37	 (We were in all two hundred seventy-six
ACT.27.38	 When they had eaten enough to be satisfied,
ACT.27.39	 When day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed
ACT.27.40	 So they slipped
ACT.27.41	 But they encountered a patch of crosscurrents
ACT.27.42	 Now the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners
ACT.27.43	 But the centurion,
ACT.27.44	 and the rest were to follow,
ACT.28.1	 After we had safely reached shore,
ACT.28.2	 The local inhabitants
ACT.28.3	 When Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood
ACT.28.4	 When the local people
ACT.28.5	 However,
ACT.28.6	 But they were expecting that he was going to swell up
ACT.28.7	 Now in the region around that place
ACT.28.8	 The father
ACT.28.9	 After this had happened, many of the people on the island who were sick
ACT.28.10	 They also bestowed many honors,
ACT.28.11	 After three months we put out to sea
ACT.28.12	 We put in
ACT.28.13	 From there we cast off
ACT.28.14	 There
ACT.28.15	 The brothers from there,
ACT.28.16	 When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to live
ACT.28.17	 After three days
ACT.28.18	 When
ACT.28.19	 But when the Jews objected,
ACT.28.20	 So for this reason I have asked to see you and speak with you, for I am bound with this chain because of the hope of Israel.”
ACT.28.21	 They replied,
ACT.28.22	 But we would like to hear from you what you think, for regarding this sect we know
ACT.28.23	 They set
ACT.28.24	 Some were convinced
ACT.28.25	 So they began to leave,
ACT.28.26	 when he said,
ACT.28.26	‘

ACT.28.27	”’
ACT.28.28	 “Therefore be advised
ACT.28.30	 Paul
ACT.28.31	 proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ
ROM.1.1	 From Paul,
ROM.1.2	 This gospel
ROM.1.3	 concerning his Son who was a descendant
ROM.1.4	 who was appointed the Son-of-God-in-power
ROM.1.5	 Through him
ROM.1.6	 You also are among them,
ROM.1.7	 To all those loved by God in Rome,
ROM.1.8	 First of all,
ROM.1.9	 For God, whom I serve in my spirit by preaching the gospel
ROM.1.10	 and I always ask
ROM.1.11	 For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift
ROM.1.12	 that is, that we may be mutually comforted by one another’s faith,
ROM.1.13	 I do not want you to be unaware,
ROM.1.14	 I am a debtor
ROM.1.15	 Thus I am eager
ROM.1.16	 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is God’s power for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
ROM.1.17	 For the righteousness
ROM.1.18	 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people
ROM.1.19	 because what can be known about God is plain to them,
ROM.1.20	 For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes – his eternal power and divine nature – have been clearly seen, because they are understood through what has been made. So people
ROM.1.21	 For although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or give him thanks, but they became futile in their thoughts and their senseless hearts
ROM.1.22	 Although they claimed
ROM.1.23	 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for an image resembling mortal human beings
ROM.1.24	 Therefore God gave them over
ROM.1.25	 They
ROM.1.26	 For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged the natural sexual relations for unnatural ones,
ROM.1.27	 and likewise the men also abandoned natural relations with women
ROM.1.28	 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God,
ROM.1.29	 They are filled
ROM.1.30	 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, contrivers of all sorts of evil, disobedient to parents, 
ROM.1.31	 senseless, covenant-breakers,
ROM.1.32	 Although they fully know
ROM.2.1	 Therefore
ROM.2.2	 Now we know that God’s judgment is in accordance with truth
ROM.2.3	 And do you think,
ROM.2.4	 Or do you have contempt for the wealth of his kindness, forbearance, and patience, and yet do not know
ROM.2.5	 But because of your stubbornness
ROM.2.6	 He
ROM.2.7	 eternal life to those who by perseverance in good works seek glory and honor and immortality, 
ROM.2.8	 but
ROM.2.9	 There will be
ROM.2.10	 but
ROM.2.11	 For there is no partiality with God. 
ROM.2.12	 For all who have sinned apart from the law
ROM.2.13	 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous before God, but those who do the law will be declared righteous.
ROM.2.14	 For whenever the Gentiles,
ROM.2.15	 They
ROM.2.16	 on the day when God will judge
ROM.2.17	 But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law
ROM.2.18	 and know his will
ROM.2.19	 and if you are convinced
ROM.2.20	 an educator of the senseless, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the essential features of knowledge and of the truth – 
ROM.2.21	 therefore
ROM.2.22	 You who tell others not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor
ROM.2.23	 You who boast in the law dishonor God by transgressing the law! 
ROM.2.24	 For just as it is written, “
ROM.2.25	 For circumcision
ROM.2.26	 Therefore if the uncircumcised man obeys
ROM.2.27	 And will not the physically uncircumcised man
ROM.2.28	 For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision something that is outward in the flesh, 
ROM.2.29	 but someone is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart
ROM.3.1	 Therefore what advantage does the Jew have, or what is the value of circumcision? 
ROM.3.2	 Actually, there are many advantages.
ROM.3.3	 What then? If some did not believe, does their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God? 
ROM.3.4	 Absolutely not! Let God be proven true, and every human being
ROM.3.5	 But if our unrighteousness demonstrates
ROM.3.6	 Absolutely not! For otherwise how could God judge the world? 
ROM.3.7	 For if by my lie the truth of God enhances
ROM.3.8	 And why not say, “Let us do evil so that good may come of it”? – as some who slander us allege that we say.
ROM.3.9	 What then? Are we better off? Certainly not, for we have already charged that Jews and Greeks alike are all under sin, 
ROM.3.10	 just as it is written: 
ROM.3.10	“
ROM.3.12	”
ROM.3.13	 “
ROM.3.13	”
ROM.3.14	 “
ROM.3.15	 “
ROM.3.18	 “
ROM.3.19	 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under
ROM.3.20	 For 
ROM.3.21	 But now
ROM.3.22	 namely, the righteousness of God through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ
ROM.3.23	 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. 
ROM.3.24	 But they are justified
ROM.3.25	 God publicly displayed
ROM.3.26	 This was
ROM.3.27	 Where, then, is boasting?
ROM.3.28	 For we consider that a person
ROM.3.29	 Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the Gentiles too? Yes, of the Gentiles too! 
ROM.3.30	 Since God is one,
ROM.3.31	 Do we then nullify
ROM.4.1	 What then shall we say that Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh,
ROM.4.2	 For if Abraham was declared righteous
ROM.4.3	 For what does the scripture say? “
ROM.4.4	 Now to the one who works, his pay is not credited due to grace but due to obligation.
ROM.4.5	 But to the one who does not work, but believes in the one who declares the ungodly righteous,
ROM.4.6	 So even David himself speaks regarding the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
ROM.4.7	 “
ROM.4.9	 Is this blessedness
ROM.4.10	 How then was it credited to him? Was he circumcised at the time, or not? No, he was not circumcised but uncircumcised! 
ROM.4.11	 And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised,
ROM.4.12	 And he is also the father of the circumcised,
ROM.4.13	 For the promise
ROM.4.14	 For if they become heirs by the law, faith is empty and the promise is nullified.
ROM.4.15	 For the law brings wrath, because where there is no law there is no transgression
ROM.4.16	 For this reason it is by faith so that it may be by grace,
ROM.4.17	 (as it is written, “
ROM.4.18	 Against hope Abraham
ROM.4.19	 Without being weak in faith, he considered
ROM.4.20	 He
ROM.4.21	 He was
ROM.4.22	 So indeed it was credited to Abraham
ROM.4.23	 But the statement
ROM.4.24	 but also for our sake, to whom it will be credited, those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. 
ROM.4.25	 He
ROM.5.1	 Therefore, since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have
ROM.5.2	 through whom we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice
ROM.5.3	 Not
ROM.5.4	 and endurance, character, and character, hope. 
ROM.5.5	 And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God
ROM.5.6	 For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. 
ROM.5.7	 (For rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person perhaps someone might possibly dare to die.)
ROM.5.8	 But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 
ROM.5.9	 Much more then, because we have now been declared righteous
ROM.5.10	 For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, since we have been reconciled, will we be saved by his life? 
ROM.5.11	 Not
ROM.5.12	 So then, just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all people
ROM.5.13	 for before the law was given,
ROM.5.14	 Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the same way that Adam (who is a type
ROM.5.15	 But the gracious gift is not like the transgression.
ROM.5.16	 And the gift is not like the one who sinned.
ROM.5.17	 For if, by the transgression of the one man,
ROM.5.18	 Consequently,
ROM.5.19	 For just as through the disobedience of the one man
ROM.5.20	 Now the law came in
ROM.5.21	 so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	 What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? 
ROM.6.2	 Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 
ROM.6.3	 Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 
ROM.6.4	 Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may live a new life.
ROM.6.5	 For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be united in the likeness of his resurrection.
ROM.6.6	 We know that
ROM.6.7	 (For someone who has died has been freed from sin.)
ROM.6.8	 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 
ROM.6.9	 We know
ROM.6.10	 For the death he died, he died to sin once for all, but the life he lives, he lives to God. 
ROM.6.11	 So you too consider yourselves
ROM.6.12	 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires, 
ROM.6.13	 and do not present your members to sin as instruments
ROM.6.14	 For sin will have no mastery over you, because you are not under law but under grace.
ROM.6.15	 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not! 
ROM.6.16	 Do you not know that if you present yourselves
ROM.6.17	 But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, you obeyed
ROM.6.18	 and having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness. 
ROM.6.19	 (I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh.)
ROM.6.20	 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness.
ROM.6.21	 So what benefit
ROM.6.22	 But now, freed
ROM.6.23	 For the payoff
ROM.7.1	 Or do you not know, brothers and sisters
ROM.7.2	 For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives, but if her
ROM.7.3	 So then,
ROM.7.4	 So, my brothers and sisters,
ROM.7.5	 For when we were in the flesh,
ROM.7.6	 But now we have been released from the law, because we have died
ROM.7.7	 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! Certainly, I
ROM.7.8	 But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of wrong desires.
ROM.7.9	 And I was once alive apart from the law, but with the coming of the commandment sin became alive 
ROM.7.10	 and I died. So
ROM.7.11	 For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it I died.
ROM.7.12	 So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.
ROM.7.13	 Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Absolutely not! But sin, so that it would be shown to be sin, produced death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful. 
ROM.7.14	 For we know that the law is spiritual – but I am unspiritual, sold into slavery to sin.
ROM.7.15	 For I don’t understand what I am doing. For I do not do what I want – instead, I do what I hate.
ROM.7.16	 But if I do what I don’t want, I agree that the law is good.
ROM.7.17	 But now it is no longer me doing it, but sin that lives in me. 
ROM.7.18	 For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I want to do the good, but I cannot do it.
ROM.7.19	 For I do not do the good I want, but I do the very evil I do not want! 
ROM.7.20	 Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer me doing it but sin that lives in me.
ROM.7.21	 So, I find the law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me. 
ROM.7.22	 For I delight in the law of God in my inner being. 
ROM.7.23	 But I see a different law in my members waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members. 
ROM.7.24	 Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 
ROM.7.25	 Thanks be
ROM.8.1	 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
ROM.8.2	 For the law of the life-giving Spirit
ROM.8.3	 For God achieved what the law could not do because
ROM.8.4	 so that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
ROM.8.5	 For those who live according to the flesh have their outlook shaped by
ROM.8.6	 For the outlook
ROM.8.7	 because the outlook of the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so. 
ROM.8.8	 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. 
ROM.8.9	 You, however, are not in
ROM.8.10	 But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, but
ROM.8.11	 Moreover if the Spirit of the one
ROM.8.12	 So then,
ROM.8.13	 (for if you live according to the flesh, you will
ROM.8.14	 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are
ROM.8.15	 For you did not receive the spirit of slavery leading again to fear,
ROM.8.16	 The Spirit himself bears witness to
ROM.8.17	 And if children, then heirs (namely, heirs of God and also fellow heirs with Christ)
ROM.8.18	 For I consider that our present sufferings cannot even be compared
ROM.8.19	 For the creation eagerly waits for the revelation of the sons of God. 
ROM.8.20	 For the creation was subjected to futility – not willingly but because of God
ROM.8.21	 that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage of decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children. 
ROM.8.22	 For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers together until now. 
ROM.8.23	 Not only this, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,
ROM.8.24	 For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? 
ROM.8.25	 But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with endurance.
ROM.8.26	 In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how we should pray,
ROM.8.27	 And he
ROM.8.28	 And we know that all things work together
ROM.8.29	 because those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that his Son
ROM.8.30	 And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.
ROM.8.31	 What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 
ROM.8.32	 Indeed, he who
ROM.8.33	 Who will bring any charge against God’s elect?
ROM.8.34	 Who is the one who will condemn? Christ
ROM.8.35	 Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will trouble, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?
ROM.8.36	 As it is written, “
ROM.8.37	 No, in all these things we have complete victory
ROM.8.38	 For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor heavenly rulers,
ROM.8.39	 nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	 I am telling the truth in Christ (I am not lying!), for my conscience assures me
ROM.9.2	 I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
ROM.9.3	 For I could wish
ROM.9.4	 who are Israelites. To them belong
ROM.9.5	 To them belong the patriarchs,
ROM.9.6	 It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel,
ROM.9.7	 nor are all the children Abraham’s true descendants; rather “
ROM.9.8	 This means
ROM.9.9	 For this is what the promise declared:
ROM.9.10	 Not only that, but when Rebekah had conceived children by one man,
ROM.9.11	 even before they were born or had done anything good or bad (so that God’s purpose in election
ROM.9.12	 it was said to her, “
ROM.9.13	 just as it is written: “
ROM.9.14	 What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! 
ROM.9.15	 For he says to Moses: “
ROM.9.16	 So then,
ROM.9.17	 For the scripture says to Pharaoh:
ROM.9.18	 So then,
ROM.9.19	 You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who has ever resisted his will?” 
ROM.9.20	 But who indeed are you – a mere human being
ROM.9.21	 Has the potter no right to make from the same lump of clay
ROM.9.22	 But what if God, willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects
ROM.9.23	 And what if he is willing to make known the wealth of his glory on the objects
ROM.9.24	 even us, whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 
ROM.9.25	 As he also says in Hosea:
ROM.9.25	“
ROM.9.26	 “
ROM.9.26	‘
ROM.9.27	 And Isaiah cries out on behalf of Israel, “
ROM.9.29	 Just
ROM.9.29	“
ROM.9.30	 What shall we say then? – that the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith, 
ROM.9.31	 but Israel even though pursuing
ROM.9.32	 Why not? Because they pursued
ROM.9.33	 just as it is written, 
ROM.9.33	“
ROM.9.33	”
ROM.10.1	 Brothers and sisters,
ROM.10.2	 For I can testify that they are zealous for God,
ROM.10.3	 For ignoring the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking instead to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. 
ROM.10.4	 For Christ is the end of the law, with the result that there is righteousness for everyone who believes.
ROM.10.5	 For Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the law: “
ROM.10.6	 But the righteousness that is by faith says: “
ROM.10.7	 or “
ROM.10.8	 But what does it say? “
ROM.10.9	 because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord
ROM.10.10	 For with the heart one believes and thus has righteousness
ROM.10.11	 For the scripture says, “
ROM.10.12	 For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, who richly blesses all who call on him. 
ROM.10.13	 For 
ROM.10.14	 How are they to call on one they have not believed in? And how are they to believe in one they have not heard of? And how are they to hear without someone preaching to them
ROM.10.15	 And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “
ROM.10.16	 But not all have obeyed the good news, for Isaiah says, “
ROM.10.17	 Consequently faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the preached word
ROM.10.18	 But I ask, have they
ROM.10.19	 But again I ask, didn’t Israel understand?
ROM.10.20	 And Isaiah is even bold enough to say, “
ROM.10.21	 But about Israel he says, “
ROM.11.1	 So I ask, God has not rejected his people, has he? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 
ROM.11.2	 God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew! Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? 
ROM.11.3	 “Lord, 
ROM.11.4	 But what was the divine response
ROM.11.5	 So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 
ROM.11.6	 And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace. 
ROM.11.7	 What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was diligently seeking, but the elect obtained it. The
ROM.11.8	 as it is written,
ROM.11.9	 And David says,
ROM.11.11	 I ask then, they did not stumble into an irrevocable fall,
ROM.11.12	 Now if their transgression means riches for the world and their defeat means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration
ROM.11.13	 Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Seeing that I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, 
ROM.11.14	 if somehow I could provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them. 
ROM.11.15	 For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 
ROM.11.16	 If the first portion
ROM.11.17	 Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and participated in
ROM.11.18	 do not boast over the branches. But if you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you. 
ROM.11.19	 Then you will say, “The branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” 
ROM.11.20	 Granted!
ROM.11.21	 For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you. 
ROM.11.22	 Notice therefore the kindness and harshness of God – harshness toward those who have fallen, but
ROM.11.23	 And even they – if they do not continue in their unbelief – will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 
ROM.11.24	 For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree?
ROM.11.25	 For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters,
ROM.11.26	 And so
ROM.11.28	 In regard to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but in regard to election they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers. 
ROM.11.29	 For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable. 
ROM.11.30	 Just as you were formerly disobedient to God, but have now received mercy due to their disobedience, 
ROM.11.31	 so they too have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now
ROM.11.32	 For God has consigned all people to disobedience so that he may show mercy to them all.
ROM.11.33	 Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how fathomless his ways!
ROM.11.36	 For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever! Amen.
ROM.12.1	 Therefore I exhort you, brothers and sisters,
ROM.12.2	 Do not be conformed
ROM.12.3	 For by the grace given to me I say to every one of you not to think more highly of yourself than you ought to think, but to think with sober discernment, as God has distributed to each of you
ROM.12.4	 For just as in one body we have many members, and not all the members serve the same function, 
ROM.12.5	 so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually we are members who belong to one another. 
ROM.12.6	 And we have different gifts
ROM.12.7	 If it is service, he must serve; if it is teaching, he must teach; 
ROM.12.8	 if it is exhortation, he must exhort; if it is contributing, he must do so with sincerity; if it is leadership, he must do so with diligence; if it is showing mercy, he must do so with cheerfulness. 
ROM.12.9	 Love must be
ROM.12.10	 Be devoted to one another with mutual love, showing eagerness in honoring one another. 
ROM.12.11	 Do not lag in zeal, be enthusiastic in spirit, serve the Lord. 
ROM.12.12	 Rejoice in hope, endure in suffering, persist in prayer. 
ROM.12.13	 Contribute to the needs of the saints, pursue hospitality. 
ROM.12.14	 Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse. 
ROM.12.15	 Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. 
ROM.12.16	 Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly.
ROM.12.17	 Do not repay anyone evil for evil; consider what is good before all people.
ROM.12.18	 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all people.
ROM.12.19	 Do not avenge yourselves, dear friends, but give place to God’s wrath,
ROM.12.20	 Rather, 
ROM.12.21	 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
ROM.13.1	 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except by God’s appointment,
ROM.13.2	 So the person who resists such authority
ROM.13.3	 (for rulers cause no fear for good conduct but for bad). Do you desire not to fear authority? Do good and you will receive its commendation, 
ROM.13.4	 for it is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be in fear, for it does not bear the sword in vain. It is God’s servant to administer retribution on the wrongdoer. 
ROM.13.5	 Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath of the authorities
ROM.13.6	 For this reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities
ROM.13.7	 Pay everyone what is owed: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due. 
ROM.13.8	 Owe no one anything, except to love one another, for the one who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. 
ROM.13.9	 For the commandments,
ROM.13.10	 Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. 
ROM.13.11	 And do this
ROM.13.12	 The night has advanced toward dawn; the day is near. So then we must lay aside the works of darkness, and put on the weapons of light. 
ROM.13.13	 Let us live decently as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in discord and jealousy. 
ROM.13.14	 Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to arouse its desires.
ROM.14.1	 Now receive the one who is weak in the faith, and do not have disputes over differing opinions.
ROM.14.2	 One person believes in eating everything, but the weak person eats only vegetables. 
ROM.14.3	 The one who eats everything must not despise the one who does not, and the one who abstains must not judge the one who eats everything, for God has accepted him. 
ROM.14.4	 Who are you to pass judgment on another’s servant? Before his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord
ROM.14.5	 One person regards one day holier than other days, and another regards them all alike.
ROM.14.6	 The one who observes the day does it for the Lord. The
ROM.14.7	 For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself. 
ROM.14.8	 If we live, we live for the Lord; if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. 
ROM.14.9	 For this reason Christ died and returned to life, so that he may be the Lord of both the dead and the living. 
ROM.14.10	 But you who eat vegetables only – why do you judge your brother or sister?
ROM.14.11	 For it is written, “
ROM.14.12	 Therefore, each of us will give an account of himself to God.
ROM.14.13	 Therefore we must not pass judgment on one another, but rather determine never to place an obstacle or a trap before a brother or sister.
ROM.14.14	 I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean in itself; still, it is unclean to the one who considers it unclean. 
ROM.14.15	 For if your brother or sister
ROM.14.16	 Therefore do not let what you consider good
ROM.14.17	 For the kingdom of God does not consist of food and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.14.18	 For the one who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by people.
ROM.14.19	 So then, let us pursue what makes for peace and for building up one another. 
ROM.14.20	 Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. For although all things are clean,
ROM.14.21	 It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything that causes your brother to stumble.
ROM.14.22	 The faith
ROM.14.23	 But the man who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not do so from faith, and whatever is not from faith is sin.
ROM.15.1	 But we who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not just please ourselves.
ROM.15.2	 Let each of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up. 
ROM.15.3	 For even Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written, “
ROM.15.4	 For everything that was written in former times was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we may have hope. 
ROM.15.5	 Now may the God of endurance and comfort give you unity with one another
ROM.15.6	 so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ROM.15.7	 Receive one another, then, just as Christ also received you, to God’s glory. 
ROM.15.8	 For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised
ROM.15.9	 and thus the Gentiles glorify God for his mercy.
ROM.15.10	 And again it says: “
ROM.15.11	 And again, “
ROM.15.12	 And again Isaiah says, “
ROM.15.13	 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe in him,
ROM.15.14	 But I myself am fully convinced about you, my brothers and sisters,
ROM.15.15	 But I have written more boldly to you on some points so as to remind you, because of the grace given to me by God 
ROM.15.16	 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I serve
ROM.15.17	 So I boast
ROM.15.18	 For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in order to bring about the obedience
ROM.15.19	 in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem even as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 
ROM.15.20	 And in this way I desire to preach where Christ has not been named, so as not to build on another person’s foundation, 
ROM.15.21	 but as it is written: “
ROM.15.22	 This is the reason I was often hindered from coming to you. 
ROM.15.23	 But now there is nothing more to keep me
ROM.15.24	 when I go to Spain. For I hope to visit you when I pass through and that you will help me
ROM.15.25	 But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. 
ROM.15.26	 For Macedonia and Achaia are pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. 
ROM.15.27	 For they were pleased to do this, and indeed they are indebted to the Jerusalem saints.
ROM.15.28	 Therefore after I have completed this and have safely delivered this bounty to them,
ROM.15.29	 and I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of Christ’s blessing. 
ROM.15.30	 Now I urge you, brothers and sisters,
ROM.15.31	 Pray
ROM.15.32	 so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company. 
ROM.15.33	 Now may the God of peace be with all of you. Amen.
ROM.16.1	 Now I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant
ROM.16.2	 so that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and provide her with whatever help she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many, including me.
ROM.16.3	 Greet Prisca and Aquila,
ROM.16.4	 who risked their own necks for my life. Not only I, but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them. 
ROM.16.5	 Also greet the church in their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus,
ROM.16.6	 Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you. 
ROM.16.7	 Greet Andronicus and Junia,
ROM.16.8	 Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my good friend Stachys. 
ROM.16.10	 Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus. 
ROM.16.11	 Greet Herodion, my compatriot.
ROM.16.12	 Greet Tryphena
ROM.16.13	 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother who was also a mother to me.
ROM.16.14	 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters
ROM.16.15	 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the believers
ROM.16.16	 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you. 
ROM.16.17	 Now I urge you, brothers and sisters,
ROM.16.18	 For these are the kind who do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By their smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds
ROM.16.19	 Your obedience is known to all and thus I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil. 
ROM.16.20	 The God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. 
ROM.16.21	 Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you; so do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my compatriots.
ROM.16.22	 I, Tertius, who am writing this letter, greet you in the Lord. 
ROM.16.23	 Gaius, who is host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus the city treasurer and our brother Quartus greet you.
ROM.16.25	 Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that had been kept secret for long ages, 
ROM.16.26	 but now is disclosed, and through the prophetic scriptures has been made known to all the nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith – 
ROM.16.27	 to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory forever! Amen.
1CO.1.1	 From Paul,
1CO.1.2	 to the church of God that is in Corinth,
1CO.1.3	 Grace and peace to you
1CO.1.4	 I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus. 
1CO.1.5	 For you were made rich
1CO.1.6	 just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed among you – 
1CO.1.7	 so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you wait for the revelation
1CO.1.8	 He
1CO.1.9	 God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
1CO.1.10	 I urge you, brothers and sisters,
1CO.1.11	 For members of Chloe’s household have made it clear to me, my brothers and sisters,
1CO.1.12	 Now I mean this, that
1CO.1.13	 Is Christ divided? Paul wasn’t crucified for you, was he?
1CO.1.14	 I thank God
1CO.1.15	 so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name! 
1CO.1.16	 (I also baptized the household of Stephanus. Otherwise, I do not remember whether I baptized anyone else.) 
1CO.1.17	 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel – and not with clever speech, so that the cross of Christ would not become useless.
1CO.1.18	 For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
1CO.1.19	 For it is written, “
1CO.1.20	 Where is the wise man? Where is the expert in the Mosaic law?
1CO.1.21	 For since in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased to save those who believe by the foolishness of preaching. 
1CO.1.22	 For Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks ask for wisdom, 
1CO.1.23	 but we preach about a crucified Christ,
1CO.1.24	 But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
1CO.1.25	 For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom,
1CO.1.26	 Think about the circumstances of your call,
1CO.1.27	 But God chose what the world thinks foolish to shame the wise, and God chose what the world thinks weak to shame the strong. 
1CO.1.28	 God chose
1CO.1.29	 so that no one can boast in his presence. 
1CO.1.30	 He is the reason you have a relationship with Christ Jesus,
1CO.1.31	 so that, as it is written, “
1CO.2.1	 When I came
1CO.2.2	 For I decided to be concerned about nothing
1CO.2.3	 And I was with you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling. 
1CO.2.4	 My conversation and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 
1CO.2.5	 so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on the power of God.
1CO.2.6	 Now we do speak wisdom among the mature,
1CO.2.7	 Instead we speak the wisdom of God, hidden in a mystery, that God determined before the ages for our glory. 
1CO.2.8	 None of the rulers of this age understood it. If they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
1CO.2.9	 But just as it is written, “
1CO.2.10	 God has revealed these to us by the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 
1CO.2.11	 For who among men knows the things of a man except the man’s spirit within him? So too, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. 
1CO.2.12	 Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God. 
1CO.2.13	 And we speak about these things, not with words taught us by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.
1CO.2.14	 The unbeliever
1CO.2.15	 The one who is spiritual discerns
1CO.3.1	 So, brothers and sisters,
1CO.3.2	 I fed you milk,
1CO.3.3	 for you are still influenced by the flesh.
1CO.3.4	 For whenever someone says, “I am with Paul,” or “I am with Apollos,” are you not merely human?
1CO.3.5	 What is Apollos, really? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you came to believe, and each of us in the ministry the Lord gave us.
1CO.3.6	 I planted,
1CO.3.7	 So neither the one who plants counts for anything,
1CO.3.8	 The one who plants and the one who waters work as one,
1CO.3.9	 We are coworkers belonging to God.
1CO.3.10	 According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master-builder I laid a foundation, but someone else builds on it. And each one must be careful how he builds. 
1CO.3.11	 For no one can lay any foundation other than what is being laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
1CO.3.12	 If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,
1CO.3.13	 each builder’s
1CO.3.14	 If what someone has built survives, he will receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	 If someone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss.
1CO.3.16	 Do you not know that you are God’s temple
1CO.3.17	 If someone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, which is what you are.
1CO.3.18	 Guard against self-deception, each of you.
1CO.3.19	 For the wisdom of this age is foolishness with God. As it is written, “
1CO.3.20	 And again, “
1CO.3.21	 So then, no more boasting about mere mortals!
1CO.3.22	 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future. Everything belongs to you, 
1CO.3.23	 and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
1CO.4.1	 One
1CO.4.2	 Now what is sought in stewards is that one be found faithful. 
1CO.4.3	 So for me, it is a minor matter that I am judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. 
1CO.4.4	 For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not acquitted because of this. The one who judges me is the Lord. 
1CO.4.5	 So then, do not judge anything before the time. Wait until the Lord comes. He will
1CO.4.6	 I have applied these things to myself and Apollos because of you, brothers and sisters,
1CO.4.7	 For who concedes you any superiority? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you boast as though you did not? 
1CO.4.8	 Already you are satisfied! Already you are rich! You have become kings without us! I wish you had become kings so that we could reign with you! 
1CO.4.9	 For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to die, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to people. 
1CO.4.10	 We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, we are dishonored! 
1CO.4.11	 To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, poorly clothed, brutally treated, and without a roof over our heads. 
1CO.4.12	 We do hard work, toiling with our own hands. When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure, 
1CO.4.13	 when people lie about us, we answer in a friendly manner. We are the world’s dirt and scum, even now.
1CO.4.14	 I am not writing these things to shame you, but to correct you as my dear children. 
1CO.4.15	 For though you may have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, because I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 
1CO.4.16	 I encourage you, then, be imitators of me. 
1CO.4.17	 For this reason, I have sent Timothy to you, who is my dear and faithful son in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ,
1CO.4.18	 Some have become arrogant,
1CO.4.19	 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing, and I will find out not only the talk of these arrogant people, but also their power. 
1CO.4.20	 For the kingdom of God is demonstrated not in idle talk but with power. 
1CO.4.21	 What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline
1CO.5.1	 It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, the kind of immorality that is not permitted even among the Gentiles, so that someone is cohabiting with
1CO.5.2	 And you are proud!
1CO.5.3	 For even though I am absent physically,
1CO.5.4	 When you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus,
1CO.5.5	 turn this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved
1CO.5.6	 Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast
1CO.5.7	 Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough – you are, in fact, without yeast. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
1CO.5.8	 So then, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of vice and evil, but with the bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.
1CO.5.9	 I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people. 
1CO.5.10	 In no way did I mean the immoral people of this world, or the greedy and swindlers and idolaters, since you would then have to go out of the world. 
1CO.5.11	 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who calls himself a Christian
1CO.5.12	 For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Are you not to judge those inside? 
1CO.5.13	 But God will judge those outside. 
1CO.6.1	 When any of you has a legal dispute with another, does he dare go to court before the unrighteous rather than before the saints? 
1CO.6.2	 Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to settle trivial suits? 
1CO.6.3	 Do you not know that we will judge angels? Why not ordinary matters! 
1CO.6.4	 So if you have ordinary lawsuits, do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church?
1CO.6.5	 I say this to your shame! Is there no one among you wise enough to settle disputes between fellow Christians?
1CO.6.6	 Instead, does a Christian sue a Christian,
1CO.6.7	 The fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves demonstrates that you have already been defeated. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? 
1CO.6.8	 But you yourselves wrong and cheat, and you do this to your brothers and sisters!
1CO.6.9	 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! The sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, passive homosexual partners,
1CO.6.10	 thieves, the greedy, drunkards, the verbally abusive,
1CO.6.11	 Some of you once lived this way.
1CO.6.12	 “All things are lawful for me”
1CO.6.13	 “Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both.”
1CO.6.14	 Now God indeed raised the Lord and he will raise us by his power. 
1CO.6.15	 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Should I take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! 
1CO.6.16	 Or do you not know that anyone who is united with
1CO.6.17	 But the one united with
1CO.6.18	 Flee sexual immorality! “Every sin a person commits is outside of the body”
1CO.6.19	 Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you,
1CO.6.20	 For you were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God with your body.
1CO.7.1	 Now with regard to the issues you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.”
1CO.7.2	 But because of immoralities, each man should have relations with
1CO.7.3	 A husband should give to his wife her sexual rights,
1CO.7.4	 It is not the wife who has the rights to her own body, but the husband. In the same way, it is not the husband who has the rights to his own body, but the wife. 
1CO.7.5	 Do not deprive each other, except by mutual agreement for a specified time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer.
1CO.7.6	 I say this as a concession, not as a command. 
1CO.7.7	 I wish that everyone was as I am. But each has his own gift from God, one this way, another that.
1CO.7.8	 To the unmarried and widows I say that it is best for them to remain as I am. 
1CO.7.9	 But if they do not have self-control, let them get married. For it is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire.
1CO.7.10	 To the married I give this command – not I, but the Lord
1CO.7.11	 (but if she does, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband), and a husband should not divorce his wife.
1CO.7.12	 To the rest I say – I, not the Lord
1CO.7.13	 And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is happy to live with her, she should not divorce him. 
1CO.7.14	 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified because of the wife, and the unbelieving wife because of her husband.
1CO.7.15	 But if the unbeliever wants a divorce, let it take place. In these circumstances the brother or sister is not bound.
1CO.7.16	 For how do you know, wife, whether you will bring your husband to salvation?
1CO.7.17	 Nevertheless,
1CO.7.18	 Was anyone called after he had been circumcised? He should not try to undo his circumcision.
1CO.7.19	 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Instead, keeping God’s commandments is what counts. 
1CO.7.20	 Let each one remain in that situation in life
1CO.7.21	 Were you called as a slave?
1CO.7.22	 For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman. In the same way, the one who was called as a free person is Christ’s slave. 
1CO.7.23	 You were bought with a price. Do not become slaves of men. 
1CO.7.24	 In whatever situation someone was called, brothers and sisters,
1CO.7.25	 With regard to the question about people who have never married,
1CO.7.26	 Because of the impending crisis I think it best for you to remain as you are. 
1CO.7.27	 The one bound to a wife should not seek divorce. The one released from a wife should not seek marriage.
1CO.7.28	 But if you marry, you have not sinned. And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face difficult circumstances,
1CO.7.29	 And I say this, brothers and sisters:
1CO.7.30	 those with tears like those not weeping, those who rejoice like those not rejoicing, those who buy like those without possessions, 
1CO.7.31	 those who use the world as though they were not using it to the full. For the present shape of this world is passing away.
1CO.7.32	 And I want you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. 
1CO.7.33	 But a married man is concerned about the things of the world, how to please his wife, 
1CO.7.34	 and he is divided. An unmarried woman
1CO.7.35	 I am saying this for your benefit, not to place a limitation on you, but so that without distraction you may give notable and constant service to the Lord.
1CO.7.36	 If anyone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his virgin,
1CO.7.37	 But the man who is firm in his commitment, and is under no necessity but has control over his will, and has decided in his own mind to keep his own virgin, does well. 
1CO.7.38	 So then, the one who marries
1CO.7.39	 A wife is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband dies,
1CO.7.40	 But in my opinion, she will be happier if she remains as she is – and I think that I too have the Spirit of God!
1CO.8.1	 With regard to food sacrificed to idols, we know that “we all have knowledge.”
1CO.8.2	 If someone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know to the degree that he needs to know. 
1CO.8.3	 But if someone loves God, he
1CO.8.4	 With regard then to eating food sacrificed to idols, we know that “an idol in this world is nothing,” and that “there is no God but one.”
1CO.8.5	 If after all there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), 
1CO.8.6	 yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we live, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we live.
1CO.8.7	 But this knowledge is not shared by all. And some, by being accustomed to idols in former times, eat this food as an idol sacrifice, and their conscience, because it is weak, is defiled. 
1CO.8.8	 Now food will not bring us close to God. We are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do. 
1CO.8.9	 But be careful that this liberty of yours does not become a hindrance to the weak. 
1CO.8.10	 For if someone weak sees you who possess knowledge dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience be “strengthened”
1CO.8.11	 So by your knowledge the weak brother or sister,
1CO.8.12	 If you sin against your brothers or sisters
1CO.8.13	 For this reason, if food causes my brother or sister to sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause one of them
1CO.9.1	 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 
1CO.9.2	 If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you, for you are the confirming sign
1CO.9.3	 This is my defense to those who examine me. 
1CO.9.4	 Do we not have the right to financial support?
1CO.9.5	 Do we not have the right to the company of a believing wife, like the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas? 
1CO.9.6	 Or do only Barnabas and I lack the right not to work? 
1CO.9.7	 Who ever serves in the army at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not consume its milk? 
1CO.9.8	 Am I saying these things only on the basis of common sense,
1CO.9.9	 For it is written in the law of Moses, “
1CO.9.10	 Or is he not surely speaking for our benefit? It was written for us, because the one plowing and threshing ought to work in hope of enjoying the harvest. 
1CO.9.11	 If we sowed spiritual blessings among you, is it too much to reap material things from you? 
1CO.9.12	 If others receive this right from you, are we not more deserving?
1CO.9.12	But we have not made use of this right. Instead we endure everything so that we may not be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ. 
1CO.9.13	 Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple
1CO.9.14	 In the same way the Lord commanded those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel. 
1CO.9.15	 But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing these things so that something will be done for me.
1CO.9.16	 For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason for boasting, because I am compelled to do this. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! 
1CO.9.17	 For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward. But if I do it unwillingly, I am entrusted with a responsibility. 
1CO.9.18	 What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel I may offer the gospel free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights in the gospel.
1CO.9.19	 For since I am free from all I can make myself a slave to all, in order to gain even more people.
1CO.9.20	 To the Jews I became like a Jew to gain the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law)
1CO.9.21	 To those free from the law I became like one free from the law (though I am not free from God’s law but under the law of Christ) to gain those free from the law. 
1CO.9.22	 To the weak I became weak in order to gain the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that by all means I may save some.
1CO.9.23	 I do all these things because of the gospel, so that I can be a participant in it.
1CO.9.24	 Do you not know that all the runners in a stadium compete, but only one receives the prize? So run to win. 
1CO.9.25	 Each competitor must exercise self-control in everything. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.
1CO.9.26	 So I do not run uncertainly or box like one who hits only air. 
1CO.9.27	 Instead I subdue my body and make it my slave, so that after preaching to others I myself will not be disqualified.
1CO.10.1	 For I do not want you to be unaware,
1CO.10.2	 and all were baptized
1CO.10.3	 and all ate the same spiritual food, 
1CO.10.4	 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they were all drinking from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. 
1CO.10.5	 But God was not pleased with most of them, for they were cut down in the wilderness. 
1CO.10.6	 These things happened as examples for us, so that we will not crave evil things as they did. 
1CO.10.7	 So do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “
1CO.10.8	 And let us not be immoral, as some of them were, and twenty-three thousand died in a single day.
1CO.10.9	 And let us not put Christ
1CO.10.10	 And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel.
1CO.10.11	 These things happened to them as examples and were written for our instruction, on whom the ends of the ages have come. 
1CO.10.12	 So let the one who thinks he is standing be careful that he does not fall. 
1CO.10.13	 No trial has overtaken you that is not faced by others.
1CO.10.14	 So then, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. 
1CO.10.15	 I am speaking to thoughtful people. Consider what I say. 
1CO.10.16	 Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ? 
1CO.10.17	 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share the one bread. 
1CO.10.18	 Look at the people of Israel.
1CO.10.19	 Am I saying that idols or food sacrificed to them amount to anything? 
1CO.10.20	 No, I mean that what the pagans sacrifice
1CO.10.21	 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot take part in the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 
1CO.10.22	 Or are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we really stronger than he is?
1CO.10.23	 “Everything is lawful,” but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is lawful,”
1CO.10.24	 Do not seek your own good, but the good of the other person. 
1CO.10.25	 Eat anything that is sold in the marketplace without questions of conscience, 
1CO.10.26	 for 
1CO.10.27	 If an unbeliever invites you to dinner and you want to go, eat whatever is served without asking questions of conscience. 
1CO.10.28	 But if someone says to you, “This is from a sacrifice,” do not eat, because of the one who told you and because of conscience
1CO.10.29	 I do not mean yours but the other person’s. For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience? 
1CO.10.30	 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I blamed for the food
1CO.10.31	 So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	 Do not give offense to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God, 
1CO.10.33	 just as I also try to please everyone in all things. I do not seek my own benefit, but the benefit
1CO.11.1	 Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.
1CO.11.2	 I praise you
1CO.11.3	 But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman,
1CO.11.4	 Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered disgraces his head. 
1CO.11.5	 But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered disgraces her head, for it is one and the same thing as having a shaved head. 
1CO.11.6	 For if a woman will not cover her head, she should cut off her hair. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, she should cover her head. 
1CO.11.7	 For a man should not have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man. 
1CO.11.8	 For man did not come from woman, but woman from man. 
1CO.11.9	 Neither was man created for the sake of woman, but woman for man. 
1CO.11.10	 For this reason a woman should have a symbol of authority
1CO.11.11	 In any case, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 
1CO.11.12	 For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman. But all things come from God. 
1CO.11.13	 Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
1CO.11.14	 Does not nature
1CO.11.15	 but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
1CO.11.16	 If anyone intends to quarrel about this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.
1CO.11.17	 Now in giving the following instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. 
1CO.11.18	 For in the first place, when you come together as a church I hear there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. 
1CO.11.19	 For there must in fact be divisions among you, so that those of you who are approved may be evident.
1CO.11.20	 Now when you come together at the same place, you are not really eating the Lord’s Supper. 
1CO.11.21	 For when it is time to eat, everyone proceeds with his own supper. One is hungry and another becomes drunk. 
1CO.11.22	 Do you not have houses so that you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show contempt for the church of God by shaming those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you for this!
1CO.11.23	 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread, 
1CO.11.24	 and after he had given thanks he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 
1CO.11.25	 In the same way, he also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, every time you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 
1CO.11.26	 For every time you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.
1CO.11.27	 For this reason, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 
1CO.11.28	 A person should examine himself first,
1CO.11.29	 For the one who eats and drinks without careful regard
1CO.11.30	 That is why many of you are weak and sick, and quite a few are dead.
1CO.11.31	 But if we examined ourselves, we would not be judged. 
1CO.11.32	 But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned with the world. 
1CO.11.33	 So then, my brothers and sisters,
1CO.11.34	 If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you assemble it does not lead to judgment. I will give directions about other matters when I come.
1CO.12.1	 With regard to spiritual gifts,
1CO.12.2	 You know that when you were pagans you were often led astray by speechless idols, however you were led. 
1CO.12.3	 So I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.4	 Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit. 
1CO.12.5	 And there are different ministries, but the same Lord. 
1CO.12.6	 And there are different results, but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. 
1CO.12.7	 To each person the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the benefit of all. 
1CO.12.8	 For one person is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, and another the message of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 
1CO.12.9	 to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 
1CO.12.10	 to another performance of miracles, to another prophecy, and to another discernment of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. 
1CO.12.11	 It is one and the same Spirit, distributing as he decides to each person, who produces all these things.
1CO.12.12	 For just as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body – though many – are one body, so too is Christ. 
1CO.12.13	 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body. Whether Jews or Greeks or slaves
1CO.12.14	 For in fact the body is not a single member, but many. 
1CO.12.15	 If the foot says, “Since I am not a hand, I am not part of the body,” it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. 
1CO.12.16	 And if the ear says, “Since I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,” it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. 
1CO.12.17	 If the whole body were an eye, what part would do the hearing? If the whole were an ear, what part would exercise the sense of smell? 
1CO.12.18	 But as a matter of fact, God has placed each of the members in the body just as he decided. 
1CO.12.19	 If they were all the same member, where would the body be? 
1CO.12.20	 So now there are many members, but one body. 
1CO.12.21	 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you,” nor in turn can the head say to the foot, “I do not need you.” 
1CO.12.22	 On the contrary, those members that seem to be weaker are essential, 
1CO.12.23	 and those members we consider less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our unpresentable members are clothed with dignity,
1CO.12.24	 but our presentable members do not need this. Instead, God has blended together the body, giving greater honor to the lesser member, 
1CO.12.25	 so that there may be no division in the body, but the members may have mutual concern for one another. 
1CO.12.26	 If one member suffers, everyone suffers with it. If a
1CO.12.27	 Now you are Christ’s body, and each of you is a member of it. 
1CO.12.28	 And God has placed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, gifts of healing, helps, gifts of leadership, different kinds of tongues. 
1CO.12.29	 Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform miracles, do they? 
1CO.12.30	 Not all have gifts of healing, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?
1CO.12.31	 But you should be eager for the greater gifts.
1CO.12.31	And now I will show you a way that is beyond comparison.
1CO.13.1	 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but I do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
1CO.13.2	 And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 
1CO.13.3	 If I give away everything I own, and if I give over my body in order to boast,
1CO.13.4	 Love is patient, love is kind, it is not envious. Love does not brag, it is not puffed up. 
1CO.13.5	 It is not rude, it is not self-serving, it is not easily angered or resentful. 
1CO.13.6	 It is not glad about injustice, but rejoices in the truth. 
1CO.13.7	 It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
1CO.13.8	 Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will be set aside; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be set aside. 
1CO.13.9	 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part, 
1CO.13.10	 but when what is perfect
1CO.13.11	 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. But when I became an adult,
1CO.13.12	 For now we see in a mirror indirectly,
1CO.13.13	 And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.
1CO.14.1	 Pursue love and be eager for the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. 
1CO.14.2	 For the one speaking in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, for no one understands; he is speaking mysteries by the Spirit.
1CO.14.3	 But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening,
1CO.14.4	 The one who speaks in a tongue builds himself up,
1CO.14.5	 I wish you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets so that the church may be strengthened.
1CO.14.6	 Now, brothers and sisters,
1CO.14.7	 It is similar for lifeless things that make a sound, like a flute or harp. Unless they make a distinction in the notes, how can what is played on the flute or harp be understood? 
1CO.14.8	 If, for example, the trumpet makes an unclear sound, who will get ready for battle? 
1CO.14.9	 It is the same for you. If you do not speak clearly with your tongue, how will anyone know what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air. 
1CO.14.10	 There are probably many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning. 
1CO.14.11	 If then I do not know the meaning of a language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. 
1CO.14.12	 It is the same with you. Since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit,
1CO.14.13	 So then, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. 
1CO.14.14	 If
1CO.14.15	 What should I do?
1CO.14.16	 Otherwise, if you are praising God with your spirit, how can someone without the gift
1CO.14.17	 For you are certainly giving thanks well, but the other person is not strengthened. 
1CO.14.18	 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you, 
1CO.14.19	 but in the church I want to speak five words with my mind to instruct others, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1CO.14.20	 Brothers and sisters,
1CO.14.21	 It is written in the law: “
1CO.14.22	 So then, tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. 
1CO.14.23	 So if the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and unbelievers or uninformed people enter, will they not say that you have lost your minds? 
1CO.14.24	 But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or uninformed person enters, he will be convicted by all, he will be called to account by all. 
1CO.14.25	 The secrets of his heart are disclosed, and in this way he will fall down with his face to the ground and worship God, declaring, “God is really among you.”
1CO.14.26	 What should you do then, brothers and sisters?
1CO.14.27	 If someone speaks in a tongue, it should be two, or at the most three, one after the other, and someone must interpret. 
1CO.14.28	 But if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church. Let him speak to himself and to God. 
1CO.14.29	 Two or three prophets should speak and the others should evaluate what is said. 
1CO.14.30	 And if someone sitting down receives a revelation, the person who is speaking should conclude. 
1CO.14.31	 For you can all prophesy one after another, so all can learn and be encouraged. 
1CO.14.32	 Indeed, the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets, 
1CO.14.33	 for God is not characterized by disorder but by peace.
1CO.14.33	As in all the churches of the saints,
1CO.14.34	 the women
1CO.14.35	 If they want to find out about something, they should ask their husbands at home, because it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church.
1CO.14.36	 Did the word of God begin with you,
1CO.14.37	 If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, he should acknowledge that what I write to you is the Lord’s command. 
1CO.14.38	 If someone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. 
1CO.14.39	 So then, brothers and sisters,
1CO.14.40	 And do everything in a decent and orderly manner.
1CO.15.1	 Now I want to make clear for you,
1CO.15.2	 and by which you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message I preached to you – unless you believed in vain. 
1CO.15.3	 For I passed on to you as of first importance
1CO.15.4	 and that he was buried, and that he was raised
1CO.15.5	 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. 
1CO.15.6	 Then he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters
1CO.15.7	 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 
1CO.15.8	 Last of all, as though to one born at the wrong time,
1CO.15.9	 For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
1CO.15.10	 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been in vain. In fact, I worked harder than all of them – yet not I, but the grace of God with me. 
1CO.15.11	 Whether then it was I or they, this is the way we preach and this is the way you believed.
1CO.15.12	 Now if Christ is being preached as raised from the dead,
1CO.15.13	 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 
1CO.15.14	 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is futile and your faith is empty. 
1CO.15.15	 Also, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified against God that he raised Christ from the dead, when in reality he did not raise him, if indeed the dead are not raised. 
1CO.15.16	 For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised. 
1CO.15.17	 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins. 
1CO.15.18	 Furthermore, those who have fallen asleep
1CO.15.19	 For if only in this life we have hope in Christ, we should be pitied more than anyone.
1CO.15.20	 But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 
1CO.15.21	 For since death came through a man,
1CO.15.22	 For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive. 
1CO.15.23	 But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; then when Christ comes, those who belong to him.
1CO.15.24	 Then
1CO.15.25	 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 
1CO.15.26	 The last enemy to be eliminated is death. 
1CO.15.27	 For 
1CO.15.28	 And when all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to the one who subjected everything to him, so that God may be all in all.
1CO.15.29	 Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead?
1CO.15.30	 Why too are we in danger every hour? 
1CO.15.31	 Every day I am in danger of death! This is as sure as
1CO.15.32	 If from a human point of view I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus,
1CO.15.33	 Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”
1CO.15.34	 Sober up as you should, and stop sinning! For some have no knowledge of God – I say this to your shame!
1CO.15.35	 But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?” 
1CO.15.36	 Fool! What you sow will not come to life unless it dies. 
1CO.15.37	 And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare seed
1CO.15.38	 But God gives it a body just as he planned, and to each of the seeds a body of its own. 
1CO.15.39	 All flesh is not the same: People have one flesh, animals have another, birds and fish another.
1CO.15.40	 And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. The glory of the heavenly body is one sort and the earthly another. 
1CO.15.41	 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.
1CO.15.42	 It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable.
1CO.15.43	 It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 
1CO.15.44	 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 
1CO.15.45	 So also it is written, “
1CO.15.46	 However, the spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and then the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	 The first man is from the earth, made of dust; the second man is from heaven. 
1CO.15.48	 Like the one made of dust, so too are those made of dust, and like the one from heaven, so too those who are heavenly. 
1CO.15.49	 And just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, let us also bear
1CO.15.50	 Now this is what I am saying, brothers and sisters:
1CO.15.51	 Listen,
1CO.15.52	 in a moment, in the blinking
1CO.15.53	 For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. 
1CO.15.54	 Now when this perishable puts on the imperishable, and this mortal puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will happen,
1CO.15.54	“
1CO.15.55	 “
1CO.15.55	”
1CO.15.56	 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 
1CO.15.57	 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! 
1CO.15.58	 So then, dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.16.1	 With regard to the collection for the saints, please follow the directions that I gave to the churches of Galatia:
1CO.16.2	 On the first day of the week, each of you should set aside some income
1CO.16.3	 Then, when I arrive, I will send those whom you approve with letters of explanation to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
1CO.16.4	 And if it seems advisable that I should go also, they will go with me.
1CO.16.5	 But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia – for I will be going through Macedonia – 
1CO.16.6	 and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you can send me on my journey, wherever I go. 
1CO.16.7	 For I do not want to see you now in passing, since I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord allows. 
1CO.16.8	 But I will stay in Ephesus
1CO.16.9	 because a door of great opportunity stands wide open for me,
1CO.16.10	 Now if Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear among you, for he is doing the Lord’s work, as I am too. 
1CO.16.11	 So then, let no one treat him with contempt. But send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me. For I am expecting him with the brothers.
1CO.16.12	 With regard to our brother Apollos: I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers,
1CO.16.13	 Stay alert, stand firm in the faith, show courage, be strong. 
1CO.16.14	 Everything you do should be done in love.
1CO.16.15	 Now, brothers and sisters,
1CO.16.16	 also to submit to people like this, and to everyone who cooperates in the work and labors hard. 
1CO.16.17	 I was glad about the arrival of Stephanus, Fortunatus, and Achaicus because they have supplied the fellowship with you that I lacked.
1CO.16.18	 For they refreshed my spirit and yours. So then, recognize people like this.
1CO.16.19	 The churches in the province of Asia
1CO.16.20	 All the brothers and sisters
1CO.16.21	 I, Paul, send this greeting with my own hand.
1CO.16.22	 Let anyone who has no love for the Lord be accursed. Our Lord, come!
1CO.16.23	 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
1CO.16.24	 My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.
2CO.1.1	 From Paul,
2CO.1.2	 Grace and peace to you
2CO.1.3	 Blessed is
2CO.1.4	 who comforts us in all our troubles
2CO.1.5	 For just as the sufferings
2CO.1.6	 But if we are afflicted,
2CO.1.7	 And our hope for you is steadfast because we know that as you share in
2CO.1.8	 For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters,
2CO.1.9	 Indeed we felt as if the sentence of death had been passed against us,
2CO.1.10	 He
2CO.1.11	 as you also join in helping us by prayer, so that many people may give thanks to God
2CO.1.12	 For our reason for confidence
2CO.1.13	 For we do not write you anything other than what
2CO.1.14	 just as also you have partly understood us, that we are your source of pride just as you also are ours
2CO.1.15	 And with this confidence I intended to come to you first so that you would get a second opportunity to see us,
2CO.1.16	 and through your help to go on into Macedonia and then from Macedonia to come back
2CO.1.17	 Therefore when I was planning to do this, I did not do so without thinking about what I was doing, did I?
2CO.1.18	 But as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.” 
2CO.1.19	 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the one who was proclaimed among you by us – by me and Silvanus
2CO.1.20	 For every one of God’s promises are “Yes” in him; therefore also through him the “Amen” is spoken, to the glory we give to God. 
2CO.1.21	 But it is God who establishes
2CO.1.22	 who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a down payment.
2CO.1.23	 Now I appeal to God as my witness,
2CO.1.24	 I do not mean that we rule over your faith, but we are workers with you for your joy, because by faith you stand firm.
2CO.2.1	 So
2CO.2.2	 For if I make you sad, who would be left to make me glad
2CO.2.3	 And I wrote this very thing to you,
2CO.2.4	 For out of great distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not to make you sad, but to let you know the love that I have especially for you.
2CO.2.5	 But if anyone has caused sadness, he has not saddened me alone, but to some extent (not to exaggerate)
2CO.2.6	 This punishment on such an individual by the majority is enough for him, 
2CO.2.7	 so that now instead
2CO.2.8	 Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.
2CO.2.9	 For this reason also I wrote you:
2CO.2.10	 If you forgive anyone for anything, I also forgive him – for indeed what I have forgiven (if I have forgiven anything) I did so for you in the presence of Christ, 
2CO.2.11	 so that we may not be exploited
2CO.2.12	 Now when I arrived in Troas
2CO.2.13	 I had no relief in my spirit,
2CO.2.14	 But thanks be to God who always leads us in triumphal procession
2CO.2.15	 For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing – 
2CO.2.16	 to the latter an odor
2CO.2.17	 For we are not like so many others, hucksters who peddle the word of God for profit,
2CO.3.1	 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? We don’t need letters of recommendation to you or from you as some other people do, do we?
2CO.3.2	 You yourselves are our letter,
2CO.3.3	 revealing
2CO.3.4	 Now we have such confidence in God through Christ. 
2CO.3.5	 Not that we are adequate
2CO.3.6	 who made us adequate
2CO.3.7	 But if the ministry that produced death – carved in letters on stone tablets
2CO.3.8	 how much more glorious will the ministry of the Spirit be?
2CO.3.9	 For if there was glory in the ministry that produced condemnation,
2CO.3.10	 For indeed, what had been glorious now
2CO.3.11	 For if what was made ineffective
2CO.3.12	 Therefore, since we have such a hope, we behave with great boldness,
2CO.3.13	 and not like Moses who used to put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites
2CO.3.14	 But their minds were closed.
2CO.3.15	 But until this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds,
2CO.3.16	 but when one
2CO.3.17	 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is present,
2CO.3.18	 And we all, with unveiled faces reflecting the glory of the Lord,
2CO.4.1	 Therefore, since we have this ministry, just as God has shown us mercy,
2CO.4.2	 But we have rejected
2CO.4.3	 But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing, 
2CO.4.4	 among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of those who do not believe
2CO.4.5	 For we do not proclaim
2CO.4.6	 For God, who said “
2CO.4.7	 But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that the extraordinary power
2CO.4.8	 We are experiencing trouble on every side,
2CO.4.9	 we are persecuted, but not abandoned;
2CO.4.10	 always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus,
2CO.4.11	 For we who are alive are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible
2CO.4.12	 As a result,
2CO.4.13	 But since we have the same spirit of faith as that shown in
2CO.4.14	 We do so
2CO.4.15	 For all these things are for your sake, so that the grace that is including
2CO.4.16	 Therefore we do not despair,
2CO.4.17	 For our momentary, light suffering
2CO.4.18	 because we are not looking at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen. For what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal.
2CO.5.1	 For we know that if our earthly house, the tent we live in,
2CO.5.2	 For in this earthly house
2CO.5.3	 if indeed, after we have put on
2CO.5.4	 For we groan while we are in this tent,
2CO.5.5	 Now the one who prepared us for this very purpose
2CO.5.6	 Therefore we are always full of courage, and we know that as long as we are alive here on earth
2CO.5.7	 for we live
2CO.5.8	 Thus we are full of courage and would prefer to be away
2CO.5.9	 So then whether we are alive
2CO.5.10	 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
2CO.5.11	 Therefore, because we know the fear of the Lord,
2CO.5.12	 We are not trying to commend
2CO.5.13	 For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you. 
2CO.5.14	 For the love of Christ
2CO.5.15	 And he died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised.
2CO.5.16	 So then from now on we acknowledge
2CO.5.17	 So then, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; what is old has passed away
2CO.5.18	 And all these things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation. 
2CO.5.19	 In other words, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting people’s trespasses against them, and he has given us
2CO.5.20	 Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His plea
2CO.5.21	 God
2CO.6.1	 Now because we are fellow workers, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
2CO.6.2	 For he says, “
2CO.6.3	 We do not give anyone
2CO.6.4	 But as God’s servants,
2CO.6.5	 in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots,
2CO.6.6	 by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by benevolence, by the Holy Spirit,
2CO.6.7	 by truthful
2CO.6.8	 through glory and dishonor, through slander and praise; regarded as impostors,
2CO.6.9	 as unknown, and yet well-known; as dying and yet – see! – we continue to live; as those who are scourged
2CO.6.10	 as sorrowful, but always rejoicing, as poor, but making many rich, as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.
2CO.6.11	 We have spoken freely to you,
2CO.6.12	 Our affection for you is not restricted,
2CO.6.13	 Now as a fair exchange – I speak as to my
2CO.6.14	 Do not become partners
2CO.6.15	 And what agreement does Christ have with Beliar?
2CO.6.16	 And what mutual agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are
2CO.6.17	 Therefore “
2CO.7.1	 Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves
2CO.7.2	 Make room for us in your hearts;
2CO.7.3	 I do not say this to condemn you, for I told you before
2CO.7.4	 I have great confidence in you; I take great pride
2CO.7.5	 For even when we came into Macedonia, our body
2CO.7.6	 But God, who encourages
2CO.7.7	 We were encouraged
2CO.7.8	 For even if I made you sad
2CO.7.9	 Now I rejoice, not because you were made sad,
2CO.7.10	 For sadness as intended by God produces a repentance that leads to salvation, leaving no regret, but worldly sadness brings about death. 
2CO.7.11	 For see what this very thing, this sadness
2CO.7.12	 So then, even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did wrong, or on account of the one who was wronged, but to reveal to you your eagerness on our behalf
2CO.7.13	 Therefore we have been encouraged. And in addition to our own encouragement, we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus, because all of you have refreshed his spirit.
2CO.7.14	 For if I have boasted to him about anything concerning you, I have not been embarrassed by you,
2CO.7.15	 And his affection for you is much greater
2CO.7.16	 I rejoice because in everything I am fully confident in you.
2CO.8.1	 Now we make known to you, brothers and sisters,
2CO.8.2	 that during a severe ordeal of suffering, their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in the wealth
2CO.8.3	 For I testify, they gave according to their means and beyond their means. They did so voluntarily,
2CO.8.4	 begging us with great earnestness for the blessing and fellowship of helping
2CO.8.5	 And they did this not just as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and to us by the will of God. 
2CO.8.6	 Thus
2CO.8.7	 But as you excel
2CO.8.8	 I am not saying this as a command, but I am testing the genuineness of your love by comparison with the eagerness of others.
2CO.8.9	 For you know the grace
2CO.8.10	 So here is my opinion on this matter: It is to your advantage, since you
2CO.8.11	 to finish what you started,
2CO.8.12	 For if the eagerness is present, the gift itself
2CO.8.13	 For I do not say this so there would be relief for others and suffering for you, but as a matter of equality. 
2CO.8.14	 At the present time, your abundance will meet their need,
2CO.8.15	 as it is written: “
2CO.8.16	 But thanks be to God who put in the heart of Titus the same devotion
2CO.8.17	 because he not only accepted our request, but since he was very eager,
2CO.8.18	 And we are sending
2CO.8.19	 In addition,
2CO.8.20	 We did this
2CO.8.21	 For we are 
2CO.8.22	 And we are sending
2CO.8.23	 If there is any question
2CO.8.24	 Therefore show
2CO.9.1	 For it is not necessary
2CO.9.2	 because I know your eagerness to help.
2CO.9.3	 But I am sending
2CO.9.4	 For if any of the Macedonians should come with me and find that you are not ready to give, we would be humiliated
2CO.9.5	 Therefore I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to go to you in advance and to arrange ahead of time the generous contribution
2CO.9.6	 My point is this: The person who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the person who sows generously
2CO.9.7	 Each one of you should give
2CO.9.8	 And God is able to make all grace overflow
2CO.9.9	 Just as it is written, “
2CO.9.10	 Now God
2CO.9.11	 You will be enriched in every way so that you may be generous on every occasion,
2CO.9.12	 because the service of this ministry is not only providing for
2CO.9.13	 Through the evidence
2CO.9.14	 And in their prayers on your behalf they long for you because of the extraordinary grace God has shown to you.
2CO.9.15	 Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
2CO.10.1	 Now I, Paul, appeal to you
2CO.10.2	 now I ask that when I am present I may not have to be bold with the confidence that (I expect) I will dare to use against some who consider us to be behaving
2CO.10.3	 For though we live
2CO.10.4	 for the weapons of our warfare are not human weapons,
2CO.10.5	 and every arrogant obstacle
2CO.10.6	 We are also ready to punish every act of disobedience,
2CO.10.7	 You are looking at outward appearances.
2CO.10.8	 For if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave us
2CO.10.9	 I do not want to seem as though I am trying to terrify you with my letters, 
2CO.10.10	 because some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but his physical presence is weak
2CO.10.11	 Let such a person consider this: What we say
2CO.10.12	 For we would not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who recommend themselves. But when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.
2CO.10.13	 But we will not boast beyond certain limits,
2CO.10.14	 For we were not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach as far as you, because we were the first to reach as far as you with the gospel about Christ.
2CO.10.15	 Nor do we boast beyond certain limits
2CO.10.16	 so that we may preach the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you, and not boast of work already done in another person’s area. 
2CO.10.17	 But 
2CO.10.18	 For it is not the person who commends himself who is approved, but the person the Lord commends.
2CO.11.1	 I wish that you would be patient with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you are being patient with me! 
2CO.11.2	 For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband,
2CO.11.3	 But I am afraid that
2CO.11.4	 For if someone comes and proclaims
2CO.11.5	 For I consider myself not at all inferior to those “super-apostles.”
2CO.11.6	 And even if I am unskilled
2CO.11.7	 Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself
2CO.11.8	 I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so that I could serve you!
2CO.11.9	 When
2CO.11.10	 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine
2CO.11.11	 Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
2CO.11.12	 And what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may eliminate any opportunity for those who want a chance to be regarded as our equals
2CO.11.13	 For such people are false apostles, deceitful
2CO.11.14	 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself
2CO.11.15	 Therefore it is not surprising his servants also disguise themselves
2CO.11.16	 I say again, let no one think that I am a fool.
2CO.11.17	 What I am saying with this boastful confidence
2CO.11.18	 Since many
2CO.11.19	 For since you are so wise, you put up with
2CO.11.20	 For you put up with
2CO.11.21	 (To my disgrace
2CO.11.22	 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. 
2CO.11.23	 Are they servants of Christ? (I am talking like I am out of my mind!) I am even more so: with much greater labors, with far more imprisonments, with more severe beatings, facing death many times. 
2CO.11.24	 Five times I received from the Jews forty lashes less one.
2CO.11.25	 Three times I was beaten with a rod.
2CO.11.26	 I have been on journeys many times, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers,
2CO.11.27	 in hard work and toil,
2CO.11.28	 Apart from other things,
2CO.11.29	 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin,
2CO.11.30	 If I must boast,
2CO.11.31	 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed forever, knows I am not lying. 
2CO.11.32	 In Damascus, the governor
2CO.11.33	 but I was let down in a rope-basket
2CO.12.1	 It is necessary to go on boasting.
2CO.12.2	 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago (whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows) was caught up to the third heaven. 
2CO.12.3	 And I know that this man (whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows) 
2CO.12.4	 was caught up into paradise
2CO.12.5	 On behalf of such an individual I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except about my weaknesses. 
2CO.12.6	 For even if I wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for I would be telling
2CO.12.7	 even because of the extraordinary character of the revelations. Therefore,
2CO.12.8	 I asked the Lord three times about this, that it would depart from me. 
2CO.12.9	 But
2CO.12.10	 Therefore I am content with
2CO.12.11	 I have become a fool. You yourselves forced me to do it, for I should have been commended by you. For I lack nothing in comparison
2CO.12.12	 Indeed, the signs of an apostle were performed among you with great perseverance
2CO.12.13	 For how
2CO.12.14	 Look, for the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you, because I do not want your possessions, but you. For children should not have
2CO.12.15	 Now I will most gladly spend and be spent for your lives!
2CO.12.16	 But be that as it may, I have not burdened you. Yet because I was a crafty person, I took you in by deceit! 
2CO.12.17	 I have not taken advantage of you through anyone I have sent to you, have I?
2CO.12.18	 I urged Titus to visit you
2CO.12.19	 Have you been thinking all this time
2CO.12.20	 For I am afraid that somehow when I come I will not find you what I wish, and you will find me
2CO.12.21	 I am afraid that
2CO.13.1	 This is the third time I am coming to visit
2CO.13.2	 I said before when I was present the second time and now, though absent, I say again to those who sinned previously and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare anyone,
2CO.13.3	 since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He
2CO.13.4	 For indeed he was crucified by reason of weakness, but he lives because of God’s power. For we also are weak in him, but we will live together with him, because of God’s power toward you. 
2CO.13.5	 Put yourselves to the test to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize regarding yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you – unless, indeed, you fail the test!
2CO.13.6	 And I hope that you will realize that we have not failed the test!
2CO.13.7	 Now we pray to God that you may not do anything wrong, not so that we may appear to have passed the test,
2CO.13.8	 For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the sake of the truth. 
2CO.13.9	 For we rejoice whenever we are weak, but you are strong. And we pray for this: that you may become fully qualified.
2CO.13.10	 Because of this I am writing these things while absent, so that when I arrive
2CO.13.11	 Finally, brothers and sisters,
2CO.13.12	 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you. 
2CO.13.13	 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
GAL.1.1	 From Paul,
GAL.1.2	 and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia. 
GAL.1.3	 Grace and peace to you
GAL.1.4	 who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father, 
GAL.1.5	 to whom be glory forever and ever! Amen. 
GAL.1.6	 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one
GAL.1.7	 not that there really is another gospel,
GAL.1.8	 But even if we (or an angel from heaven) should preach
GAL.1.9	 As we have said before, and now I say again, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be condemned to hell!
GAL.1.10	 Am I now trying to gain the approval of people,
GAL.1.11	 Now
GAL.1.12	 For I did not receive it or learn it from any human source;
GAL.1.13	 For you have heard of my former way of life
GAL.1.14	 I
GAL.1.15	 But when the one
GAL.1.16	 to reveal his Son in
GAL.1.17	 nor did I go up to Jerusalem
GAL.1.18	 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem
GAL.1.19	 But I saw none of the other apostles
GAL.1.20	 I assure you
GAL.1.21	 Afterward I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	 But I was personally
GAL.1.23	 They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news
GAL.1.24	 So
GAL.2.1	 Then after fourteen years I went up to Jerusalem
GAL.2.2	 I went there
GAL.2.3	 Yet
GAL.2.4	 Now this matter arose
GAL.2.5	 But
GAL.2.6	 But from those who were influential
GAL.2.7	 On the contrary, when they saw
GAL.2.8	 (for he who empowered
GAL.2.9	 and when James, Cephas,
GAL.2.10	 They requested
GAL.2.11	 But when Cephas
GAL.2.12	 Until
GAL.2.13	 And the rest of the Jews also joined with him in this hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray with them
GAL.2.14	 But when I saw that they were not behaving consistently with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas
GAL.2.15	 We are Jews by birth
GAL.2.16	 yet we know
GAL.2.17	 But if while seeking to be justified in Christ we ourselves have also been found to be sinners, is Christ then one who encourages
GAL.2.18	 But if I build up again those things I once destroyed,
GAL.2.19	 For through the law I died to the law so that I may live to God. 
GAL.2.20	 I have been crucified with Christ,
GAL.2.21	 I do not set aside
GAL.3.1	 You
GAL.3.2	 The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law
GAL.3.3	 Are you so foolish? Although you began
GAL.3.4	 Have you suffered so many things for nothing? – if indeed it was for nothing. 
GAL.3.5	 Does God then give
GAL.3.6	 Just as Abraham 
GAL.3.7	 so then, understand
GAL.3.8	 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the gospel to Abraham ahead of time,
GAL.3.9	 So then those who believe
GAL.3.10	 For all who
GAL.3.11	 Now it is clear no one is justified before God by the law, because
GAL.3.12	 But the law is not based on faith,
GAL.3.13	 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming
GAL.3.14	 in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles,
GAL.3.15	 Brothers and sisters,
GAL.3.16	 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant.
GAL.3.17	 What I am saying is this: The law that came four hundred thirty years later does not cancel a covenant previously ratified by God,
GAL.3.18	 For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on the promise, but God graciously gave
GAL.3.19	 Why then was the law given?
GAL.3.20	 Now an intermediary is not for one party alone, but God is one.
GAL.3.21	 Is the law therefore opposed to the promises of God?
GAL.3.22	 But the scripture imprisoned
GAL.3.23	 Now before faith
GAL.3.24	 Thus the law had become our guardian
GAL.3.25	 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
GAL.3.26	 For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith.
GAL.3.27	 For all of you who
GAL.3.28	 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave
GAL.3.29	 And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants,
GAL.4.1	 Now I mean that the heir, as long as he is a minor,
GAL.4.2	 But he is under guardians
GAL.4.3	 So also we, when we were minors,
GAL.4.4	 But when the appropriate time
GAL.4.5	 to redeem those who were under the law, so that we may be adopted as sons with full rights.
GAL.4.6	 And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls
GAL.4.7	 So you are no longer a slave but a son, and if you are
GAL.4.8	 Formerly when you did not know God, you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods at all.
GAL.4.9	 But now that you have come to know God (or rather to be known by God), how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless
GAL.4.10	 You are observing religious
GAL.4.11	 I fear for you that my work for you may have been in vain. 
GAL.4.12	 I beg you, brothers and sisters,
GAL.4.13	 But you know it was because of a physical illness that I first proclaimed the gospel to you, 
GAL.4.14	 and though my physical condition put you to the test, you did not despise or reject me.
GAL.4.15	 Where then is your sense of happiness
GAL.4.16	 So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
GAL.4.17	 They court you eagerly,
GAL.4.18	 However, it is good
GAL.4.19	 My children – I am again undergoing birth pains until Christ is formed in you!
GAL.4.20	 I wish I could be with you now and change my tone of voice,
GAL.4.21	 Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not understand the law?
GAL.4.22	 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the
GAL.4.23	 But one, the son by the slave woman, was born by natural descent,
GAL.4.24	 These things may be treated as an allegory,
GAL.4.25	 Now Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. 
GAL.4.26	 But the Jerusalem above is free,
GAL.4.27	 For it is written:
GAL.4.27	“
GAL.4.28	 But you,
GAL.4.29	 But just as at that time the one born by natural descent
GAL.4.30	 But what does the scripture say? “
GAL.4.31	 Therefore, brothers and sisters,
GAL.5.1	 For freedom
GAL.5.2	 Listen! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you at all! 
GAL.5.3	 And I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey
GAL.5.4	 You who are trying to be declared righteous
GAL.5.5	 For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait expectantly for the hope of righteousness. 
GAL.5.6	 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision carries any weight – the only thing that matters is faith working through love.
GAL.5.7	 You were running well; who prevented you from obeying
GAL.5.8	 This persuasion
GAL.5.9	 A little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise!
GAL.5.10	 I am confident
GAL.5.11	 Now, brothers and sisters,
GAL.5.12	 I wish those agitators
GAL.5.13	 For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters;
GAL.5.14	 For the whole law can be summed up in a single commandment,
GAL.5.15	 However, if you continually bite and devour one another,
GAL.5.16	 But I say, live
GAL.5.17	 For the flesh has desires that are opposed to the Spirit, and the Spirit has desires
GAL.5.18	 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 
GAL.5.19	 Now the works of the flesh
GAL.5.20	 idolatry, sorcery,
GAL.5.21	 envying,
GAL.5.22	 But the fruit of the Spirit
GAL.5.23	 gentleness, and
GAL.5.24	 Now those who belong to Christ
GAL.5.25	 If we live by the Spirit, let us also behave in accordance with
GAL.5.26	 Let us not become conceited,
GAL.6.1	 Brothers and sisters,
GAL.6.2	 Carry one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. 
GAL.6.3	 For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 
GAL.6.4	 Let each one examine
GAL.6.5	 For each one will carry
GAL.6.6	 Now the one who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with the one who teaches
GAL.6.7	 Do not be deceived. God will not be made a fool.
GAL.6.8	 because the person who sows to his own flesh
GAL.6.9	 So we must not grow weary
GAL.6.10	 So then,
GAL.6.11	 See what big letters I make as I write to you with my own hand!
GAL.6.12	 Those who want to make a good showing in external matters
GAL.6.13	 For those who are circumcised do not obey the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your flesh.
GAL.6.14	 But may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which
GAL.6.15	 For
GAL.6.16	 And all who will behave
GAL.6.17	 From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.
GAL.6.18	 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
EPH.1.1	 From Paul,
EPH.1.2	 Grace and peace to you
EPH.1.3	 Blessed
EPH.1.4	 For
EPH.1.5	 He did this by predestining
EPH.1.6	 to the praise of the glory of his grace
EPH.1.7	 In him
EPH.1.8	 that he lavished on us in all wisdom and insight. 
EPH.1.9	 He did this when he revealed
EPH.1.10	 toward the administration of the fullness of the times, to head up
EPH.1.11	 In Christ
EPH.1.12	 so that we, who were the first to set our hope
EPH.1.13	 And when
EPH.1.14	 who is the down payment
EPH.1.15	 For this reason,
EPH.1.16	 I do not cease to give thanks for you when I remember you
EPH.1.17	 I pray that
EPH.1.18	 – since the eyes of your
EPH.1.19	 and what is the incomparable
EPH.1.20	 This power
EPH.1.21	 far above every rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. 
EPH.1.22	 And God
EPH.1.23	 Now the church is
EPH.2.1	 And although you were
EPH.2.2	 in which
EPH.2.3	 among whom
EPH.2.4	 But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us, 
EPH.2.5	 even though we were dead in transgressions, made us alive together with Christ – by grace you are saved!
EPH.2.6	 and he raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 
EPH.2.7	 to demonstrate in the coming ages
EPH.2.8	 For by grace you are saved
EPH.2.9	 it is not from
EPH.2.10	 For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared beforehand so we may do them.
EPH.2.11	 Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh – who are called “uncircumcision” by the so-called “circumcision” that is performed on the body
EPH.2.12	 that you were at that time without the Messiah,
EPH.2.13	 But now in Christ Jesus you who used to be far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
EPH.2.14	 For he is our peace, the one who made both groups into one
EPH.2.15	 when he nullified
EPH.2.16	 and to reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by which the hostility has been killed.
EPH.2.17	 And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near, 
EPH.2.18	 so that
EPH.2.19	 So then you are no longer foreigners and noncitizens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of God’s household, 
EPH.2.20	 because you have been built
EPH.2.21	 In him
EPH.2.22	 in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.
EPH.3.1	 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus
EPH.3.2	 if indeed
EPH.3.3	 that
EPH.3.4	 When reading this,
EPH.3.5	 Now this secret
EPH.3.6	 namely, that through the gospel
EPH.3.7	 I became a servant of this gospel
EPH.3.8	 To me – less than the least of all the saints
EPH.3.9	 and to enlighten
EPH.3.10	 The purpose of this enlightenment is that
EPH.3.11	 This was according to
EPH.3.12	 in whom we have boldness and confident access
EPH.3.13	 For this reason I ask you
EPH.3.14	 For this reason
EPH.3.15	 from
EPH.3.16	 I pray that
EPH.3.17	 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, so that, because you have been rooted and grounded in love, 
EPH.3.18	 you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
EPH.3.19	 and thus to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled up to
EPH.3.20	 Now to him who by the power that is working within us
EPH.3.21	 to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
EPH.4.1	 I, therefore, the prisoner for the Lord,
EPH.4.2	 with all humility and gentleness,
EPH.4.3	 making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
EPH.4.4	 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you too were called to the one hope of your calling, 
EPH.4.5	 one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
EPH.4.6	 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
EPH.4.7	 But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 
EPH.4.8	 Therefore it says
EPH.4.9	 Now what is the meaning of “
EPH.4.10	 He, the very one
EPH.4.11	 It was he
EPH.4.12	 to equip
EPH.4.13	 until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God – a mature person, attaining to
EPH.4.14	 So
EPH.4.15	 But practicing the truth in love,
EPH.4.16	 From him the whole body grows, fitted and held together
EPH.4.17	 So I say this, and insist
EPH.4.18	 They are darkened in their understanding,
EPH.4.19	 Because they are callous, they have given themselves over to indecency for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
EPH.4.20	 But you did not learn about Christ like this, 
EPH.4.21	 if indeed you heard about him and were taught in him, just as the truth is in Jesus. 
EPH.4.22	 You were taught with reference to your former way of life to lay aside
EPH.4.23	 to be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 
EPH.4.24	 and to put on the new man who has been created in God’s image
EPH.4.25	 Therefore, having laid aside falsehood
EPH.4.27	 Do not give the devil an opportunity. 
EPH.4.28	 The one who steals must steal no longer; rather he must labor, doing good with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with the one who has need. 
EPH.4.29	 You must let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but only what is beneficial for the building up of the one in need,
EPH.4.30	 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 
EPH.4.31	 You must put away every kind of bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling, and evil, slanderous talk. 
EPH.4.32	 Instead,
EPH.5.1	 Therefore, be
EPH.5.2	 and live
EPH.5.3	 But
EPH.5.4	 Neither should there be vulgar speech, foolish talk, or coarse jesting – all of which are out of character – but rather thanksgiving. 
EPH.5.5	 For you can be confident of this one thing:
EPH.5.6	 Let nobody deceive you with empty words, for because of these things God’s wrath comes on the sons of disobedience.
EPH.5.7	 Therefore do not be partakers with them,
EPH.5.8	 for you were at one time darkness, but now you are
EPH.5.9	 for the fruit of the light
EPH.5.10	 trying to learn
EPH.5.11	 Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather
EPH.5.12	 For the things they do
EPH.5.13	 But all things being exposed by the light are made evident. 
EPH.5.14	 For everything made evident is light, and for this reason it says:
EPH.5.14	“Awake,
EPH.5.14	Rise from the dead,
EPH.5.14	and Christ will shine on you!”
EPH.5.15	 Therefore be very careful how you live – not as unwise but as wise, 
EPH.5.16	 taking advantage of every opportunity, because the days are evil. 
EPH.5.17	 For this reason do not be foolish, but be wise
EPH.5.18	 And do not get drunk with wine, which
EPH.5.19	 speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music
EPH.5.20	 always giving thanks to God the Father for each other
EPH.5.21	 and submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
EPH.5.22	 Wives, submit
EPH.5.23	 because the husband is the head of the wife as also Christ is the head of the church – he himself being the savior of the body. 
EPH.5.24	 But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. 
EPH.5.25	 Husbands, love your
EPH.5.26	 to sanctify her by cleansing her
EPH.5.27	 so that he
EPH.5.28	 In the same way
EPH.5.29	 For no one has ever hated his own body
EPH.5.30	 for we are members of his body.
EPH.5.32	 This mystery is great – but I am actually
EPH.5.33	 Nevertheless,
EPH.6.1	 Children,
EPH.6.2	 “
EPH.6.3	 “
EPH.6.4	 Fathers,
EPH.6.5	 Slaves,
EPH.6.6	 not like those who do their work only when someone is watching
EPH.6.7	 Obey
EPH.6.8	 because you know that each person, whether slave or free, if he does something good, this
EPH.6.9	 Masters,
EPH.6.10	 Finally, be strengthened in the Lord and in the strength of his power. 
EPH.6.11	 Clothe yourselves with the full armor of God so that you may be able to stand against the schemes
EPH.6.12	 For our struggle
EPH.6.13	 For this reason, take up the full armor of God so that you may be able to stand your ground
EPH.6.14	 Stand firm therefore, by fastening
EPH.6.15	 by fitting your
EPH.6.16	 and in all of this,
EPH.6.17	 And take 
EPH.6.18	 With every prayer and petition, pray
EPH.6.19	 Pray
EPH.6.20	 for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may be able to speak boldly as I ought to speak.
EPH.6.21	 Tychicus, my
EPH.6.22	 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know our circumstances
EPH.6.23	 Peace to the brothers and sisters,
EPH.6.24	 Grace be
PHP.1.1	 From Paul
PHP.1.2	 Grace and peace to you
PHP.1.3	 I thank my God every time I remember you.
PHP.1.4	 I always pray with joy in my every prayer for all of you 
PHP.1.5	 because of your participation
PHP.1.6	 For I am sure of this very thing,
PHP.1.7	 For
PHP.1.8	 For God is my witness that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. 
PHP.1.9	 And I pray this, that your love may abound even more and more in knowledge and every kind of insight 
PHP.1.10	 so that you can decide what is best, and thus be sincere and blameless for the day of Christ, 
PHP.1.11	 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.
PHP.1.12	 I want you to know, brothers and sisters,
PHP.1.13	 The
PHP.1.14	 and most of the brothers and sisters,
PHP.1.15	 Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill. 
PHP.1.16	 The latter do so from love because they know that I am placed here for the defense of the gospel. 
PHP.1.17	 The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, because they think they can cause trouble for me in my imprisonment.
PHP.1.18	 What is the result? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and in this I rejoice.
PHP.1.18	Yes,
PHP.1.19	 for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance
PHP.1.20	 My confident hope
PHP.1.21	 For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain. 
PHP.1.22	 Now if I am to go on living in the body,
PHP.1.23	 I feel torn between the two,
PHP.1.24	 but it is more vital for your sake that I remain
PHP.1.25	 And since I am sure of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for the sake of your progress
PHP.1.26	 so that what you can be proud of may increase
PHP.1.27	 Only conduct yourselves
PHP.1.28	 and by not being intimidated in any way by your opponents. This is
PHP.1.29	 For it has been granted to you
PHP.1.30	 since you are encountering
PHP.2.1	 Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort provided by love, any fellowship in the Spirit,
PHP.2.2	 complete my joy and be of the same mind,
PHP.2.3	 Instead of being motivated by selfish ambition
PHP.2.4	 Each of you should be concerned
PHP.2.5	 You should have the same attitude toward one another that Christ Jesus had,
PHP.2.6	 who though he existed in the form of God
PHP.2.6	did not regard equality with God
PHP.2.6	as something to be grasped,
PHP.2.7	 but emptied himself
PHP.2.7	by taking on the form of a slave,
PHP.2.7	by looking like other men,
PHP.2.7	and by sharing in human nature.
PHP.2.8	 He humbled himself, 
PHP.2.8	by becoming obedient to the point of death
PHP.2.8	 – even death on a cross!
PHP.2.9	 As a result God exalted him
PHP.2.9	and gave him the name
PHP.2.9	that is above every name,
PHP.2.10	 so that at the name of Jesus
PHP.2.10	every knee will bow
PHP.2.10	 – in heaven and on earth and under the earth – 
PHP.2.11	 and every tongue confess
PHP.2.11	that Jesus Christ is Lord
PHP.2.11	to the glory of God the Father.
PHP.2.12	 So then, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence but even more in my absence, continue working out your salvation with awe and reverence,
PHP.2.13	 for the one bringing forth in you both the desire and the effort – for the sake of his good pleasure – is God. 
PHP.2.14	 Do everything without grumbling or arguing, 
PHP.2.15	 so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without blemish though you live in a crooked and perverse society, in which you shine as lights in the world
PHP.2.16	 by holding on to
PHP.2.17	 But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice together with all of you. 
PHP.2.18	 And in the same way you also should be glad and rejoice together with me.
PHP.2.19	 Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be encouraged by hearing news about you. 
PHP.2.20	 For there is no one here like him who will readily demonstrate his deep concern for you.
PHP.2.21	 Others are busy with their own concerns, not those of Jesus Christ. 
PHP.2.22	 But you know his qualifications, that like a son working with his father, he served with me in advancing the gospel. 
PHP.2.23	 So I hope to send him as soon as I know more about my situation, 
PHP.2.24	 though I am confident in the Lord that I too will be coming to see you
PHP.2.25	 But for now
PHP.2.26	 Indeed, he greatly missed all of you and was distressed because you heard that he had been ill. 
PHP.2.27	 In fact he became so ill that he nearly died.
PHP.2.28	 Therefore I am all the more eager to send him,
PHP.2.29	 So welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, 
PHP.2.30	 since it was because of the work of Christ that he almost died. He risked his life so that he could make up for your inability to serve me.
PHP.3.1	 Finally, my brothers and sisters,
PHP.3.2	 Beware of the dogs,
PHP.3.3	 For we are the circumcision,
PHP.3.4	 – though mine too are significant.
PHP.3.5	 I was circumcised on the eighth day, from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. I lived according to the law as a Pharisee.
PHP.3.6	 In my zeal for God I persecuted the church. According to the righteousness stipulated in the law I was blameless. 
PHP.3.7	 But these assets I have come to regard as liabilities because of Christ. 
PHP.3.8	 More than that, I now regard all things as liabilities compared to the far greater value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things – indeed, I regard them as dung!
PHP.3.9	 and be found in him, not because I have my own righteousness derived from the law, but because I have the righteousness that comes by way of Christ’s faithfulness
PHP.3.10	 My aim is to know him,
PHP.3.11	 and so, somehow,
PHP.3.12	 Not that I have already attained this – that is, I have not already been perfected – but I strive to lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus also laid hold of me.
PHP.3.13	 Brothers and sisters,
PHP.3.14	 with this goal in mind,
PHP.3.15	 Therefore let those of us who are “perfect” embrace this point of view.
PHP.3.16	 Nevertheless, let us live up to the standard
PHP.3.17	 Be imitators of me,
PHP.3.18	 For many live, about whom I have often told you, and now, with tears, I tell you that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ. 
PHP.3.19	 Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, they exult in their shame, and they think about earthly things.
PHP.3.20	 But our citizenship is in heaven – and we also await a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, 
PHP.3.21	 who will transform these humble bodies of ours
PHP.4.1	 So then, my brothers and sisters,
PHP.4.2	 I appeal to Euodia and to Syntyche to agree in the Lord. 
PHP.4.3	 Yes, I say also to you, true companion,
PHP.4.4	 Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, rejoice! 
PHP.4.5	 Let everyone see your gentleness.
PHP.4.6	 Do not be anxious about anything. Instead, in every situation, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, tell your requests to God. 
PHP.4.7	 And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds
PHP.4.8	 Finally, brothers and sisters,
PHP.4.9	 And what you learned and received and heard and saw in me, do these things. And the God of peace will be with you.
PHP.4.10	 I have great joy in the Lord because now at last you have again expressed your concern for me. (Now I know you were concerned before but had no opportunity to do anything.)
PHP.4.11	 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content in any circumstance. 
PHP.4.12	 I have experienced times of need and times of abundance. In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of contentment,
PHP.4.13	 I am able to do all things
PHP.4.14	 Nevertheless, you did well to share with me in my trouble.
PHP.4.15	 And as you Philippians know, at the beginning of my gospel ministry, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in this matter of giving and receiving except you alone. 
PHP.4.16	 For even in Thessalonica
PHP.4.17	 I do not say this because I am seeking a gift.
PHP.4.18	 For I have received everything, and I have plenty. I have all I need because I received from Epaphroditus what you sent – a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, very pleasing to God. 
PHP.4.19	 And my God will supply your every need according to his glorious riches
PHP.4.20	 May glory be given to God our Father forever and ever. Amen.
PHP.4.21	 Give greetings to all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers
PHP.4.22	 All the saints greet you, especially those who belong to Caesar’s household. 
PHP.4.23	 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
COL.1.1	 From Paul,
COL.1.2	 to the saints, the faithful
COL.1.3	 We always
COL.1.4	 since
COL.1.5	 Your faith and love have arisen
COL.1.6	 that has come to you. Just as in the entire world this gospel
COL.1.7	 You learned the gospel
COL.1.8	 who also told us of your love in the Spirit.
COL.1.9	 For this reason we also, from the day we heard about you,
COL.1.10	 so that you may live
COL.1.11	 being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for the display of
COL.1.12	 giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share
COL.1.13	 He delivered us from the power of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of the Son he loves,
COL.1.14	 in whom we have redemption,
COL.1.15	 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn
COL.1.16	 for all things in heaven and on earth were created by him – all things, whether visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions,
COL.1.17	 He himself is before all things and all things are held together
COL.1.18	 He is the head of the body, the church, as well as the beginning, the firstborn
COL.1.19	 For God
COL.1.20	 and through him to reconcile all things to himself by making peace through the blood of his cross – through him,
COL.1.21	 And you were at one time strangers and enemies in your
COL.1.22	 but now he has reconciled you
COL.1.23	 if indeed you remain in the faith, established and firm,
COL.1.24	 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I fill up in my physical body – for the sake of his body, the church – what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ. 
COL.1.25	 I became a servant of the church according to the stewardship
COL.1.26	 that is, the mystery that has been kept hidden from ages and generations, but has now been revealed to his saints. 
COL.1.27	 God wanted to make known to them the glorious
COL.1.28	 We proclaim him by instructing
COL.1.29	 Toward this goal
COL.2.1	 For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you,
COL.2.2	 My goal is that
COL.2.3	 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
COL.2.4	 I say this so that no one will deceive you through arguments
COL.2.5	 For though
COL.2.6	 Therefore, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord,
COL.2.7	 rooted
COL.2.8	 Be careful not to allow anyone to captivate you
COL.2.9	 For in him all the fullness of deity lives
COL.2.10	 and you have been filled in him, who is the head over every ruler and authority. 
COL.2.11	 In him you also were circumcised – not, however,
COL.2.12	 Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your
COL.2.13	 And even though you were dead in your
COL.2.14	 He has destroyed
COL.2.15	 Disarming
COL.2.16	 Therefore do not let anyone judge you with respect to food or drink, or in the matter of a feast, new moon, or Sabbath days – 
COL.2.17	 these are only
COL.2.18	 Let no one who delights in humility and the worship of angels pass judgment on you. That person goes on at great lengths
COL.2.19	 He has not held fast
COL.2.20	 If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits
COL.2.21	 “Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!” 
COL.2.22	 These are all destined to perish with use, founded as they are
COL.2.23	 Even though they have the appearance of wisdom
COL.3.1	 Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
COL.3.2	 Keep thinking about things above, not things on the earth, 
COL.3.3	 for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	 When Christ (who is your
COL.3.5	 So put to death whatever in your nature belongs to the earth:
COL.3.6	 Because of these things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.
COL.3.7	 You also lived your lives
COL.3.8	 But now, put off all such things
COL.3.9	 Do not lie to one another since you have put off the old man with its practices 
COL.3.10	 and have been clothed with the new man
COL.3.11	 Here there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave
COL.3.12	 Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with a heart of mercy,
COL.3.13	 bearing with one another and forgiving
COL.3.14	 And to all these
COL.3.15	 Let the peace of Christ be in control in your heart (for you were in fact called as one body
COL.3.16	 Let the word of Christ
COL.3.17	 And whatever you do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. 
COL.3.18	 Wives, submit to your
COL.3.19	 Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them. 
COL.3.20	 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing in the Lord. 
COL.3.21	 Fathers,
COL.3.22	 Slaves,
COL.3.23	 Whatever you are doing,
COL.3.24	 because you know that you will receive your
COL.3.25	 For the one who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong,
COL.4.1	 Masters, treat your slaves with justice and fairness, because you know that you also have a master in heaven.
COL.4.2	 Be devoted to prayer, keeping alert in it with thanksgiving. 
COL.4.3	 At the same time pray
COL.4.4	 Pray that I may make it known as I should.
COL.4.5	 Conduct yourselves
COL.4.6	 Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer everyone. 
COL.4.7	 Tychicus, a dear brother, faithful minister, and fellow slave
COL.4.8	 I sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are doing
COL.4.9	 I sent him
COL.4.10	 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him). 
COL.4.11	 And Jesus who is called Justus also sends greetings. In terms of Jewish converts,
COL.4.12	 Epaphras, who is one of you and a slave
COL.4.13	 For I can testify that he has worked hard
COL.4.14	 Our dear friend Luke the physician and Demas greet you. 
COL.4.15	 Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters
COL.4.16	 And after
COL.4.17	 And tell Archippus, “See to it that you complete the ministry you received in the Lord.” 
COL.4.18	 I, Paul, write this greeting by my own hand.
1TH.1.1	 From Paul
1TH.1.2	 We thank God always for all of you as we mention you constantly
1TH.1.3	 because we recall
1TH.1.4	 We know,
1TH.1.5	 in that
1TH.1.6	 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, when you received
1TH.1.7	 As a result you became an example
1TH.1.8	 For from you the message of the Lord
1TH.1.9	 For people everywhere
1TH.1.10	 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus our deliverer from the coming wrath.
1TH.2.1	 For you yourselves know, brothers and sisters,
1TH.2.2	 But although we suffered earlier and were mistreated in Philippi,
1TH.2.3	 For the appeal we make
1TH.2.4	 but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we declare it, not to please people but God, who examines our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	 For we never appeared
1TH.2.6	 nor to seek glory from people, either from you or from others, 
1TH.2.7	 although we could have imposed our weight as apostles of Christ; instead we became
1TH.2.8	 with such affection for you
1TH.2.9	 For you recall, brothers and sisters,
1TH.2.10	 You are witnesses, and so is God, as to how holy and righteous and blameless our conduct was toward you who believe. 
1TH.2.11	 As you know, we treated each one of you as a father treats his own children, 
1TH.2.12	 exhorting and encouraging you and insisting that you live in a way worthy of God who calls you to his own kingdom and his glory. 
1TH.2.13	 And so
1TH.2.14	 For you became imitators, brothers and sisters,
1TH.2.15	 who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets
1TH.2.16	 because they hinder us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. Thus they constantly fill up their measure of sins,
1TH.2.17	 But when we were separated from you, brothers and sisters,
1TH.2.18	 For we wanted to come to you (I, Paul, in fact tried again and again)
1TH.2.19	 For who is our hope or joy or crown to boast of
1TH.2.20	 For you are our glory and joy!
1TH.3.1	 So when we could bear it no longer, we decided to stay on in Athens
1TH.3.2	 We
1TH.3.3	 so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined for this. 
1TH.3.4	 For in fact when we were with you, we were telling you in advance that we would suffer affliction, and so it has happened, as you well know.
1TH.3.5	 So
1TH.3.6	 But now Timothy has come
1TH.3.7	 So
1TH.3.8	 For now we are alive again,
1TH.3.9	 For how can we thank God enough for you,
1TH.3.10	 We pray earnestly night and day to see you in person
1TH.3.11	 Now may God our Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you. 
1TH.3.12	 And may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we do for you, 
1TH.3.13	 so that your hearts are strengthened in holiness to be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
1TH.4.1	 Finally then, brothers and sisters,
1TH.4.2	 For you know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus. 
1TH.4.3	 For this is God’s will: that you become holy,
1TH.4.4	 that each of you know how to possess his own body
1TH.4.5	 not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God. 
1TH.4.6	 In this matter no one should violate the rights of his brother or take advantage of him,
1TH.4.7	 For God did not call us to impurity but in holiness. 
1TH.4.8	 Consequently the one who rejects this is not rejecting human authority
1TH.4.9	 Now on the topic of brotherly love
1TH.4.10	 And indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers and sisters
1TH.4.11	 to aspire to lead a quiet life, to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we commanded you. 
1TH.4.12	 In this way you will live
1TH.4.13	 Now we do not want you to be uninformed,
1TH.4.14	 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that
1TH.4.15	 For we tell you this by the word of the Lord,
1TH.4.16	 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel,
1TH.4.17	 Then we who are alive, who are left,
1TH.4.18	 Therefore encourage one another with these words.
1TH.5.1	 Now on the topic of times and seasons,
1TH.5.2	 For you know quite well that the day of the Lord
1TH.5.3	 Now when
1TH.5.4	 But you, brothers and sisters,
1TH.5.5	 For you all are sons of the light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of the darkness. 
1TH.5.6	 So then we must not sleep as the rest, but must stay alert and sober. 
1TH.5.7	 For those who sleep, sleep at night and those who get drunk are drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	 But since we are of the day, we must stay sober 
1TH.5.9	 For God did not destine us for wrath
1TH.5.10	 He died
1TH.5.11	 Therefore encourage one another and build up each other, just as you are in fact doing.
1TH.5.12	 Now we ask you, brothers and sisters,
1TH.5.13	 and to esteem them most highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
1TH.5.14	 And we urge you, brothers and sisters,
1TH.5.15	 See that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good for one another and for all. 
1TH.5.16	 Always rejoice, 
1TH.5.17	 constantly pray, 
1TH.5.18	 in everything give thanks. For this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. 
1TH.5.19	 Do not extinguish the Spirit. 
1TH.5.20	 Do not treat prophecies with contempt. 
1TH.5.21	 But examine all things; hold fast to what is good. 
1TH.5.22	 Stay away from every form of evil.
1TH.5.23	 Now may the God of peace himself make you completely holy and may your spirit and soul and body be kept entirely blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.5.24	 He who calls you is trustworthy, and he will in fact do this.
1TH.5.25	 Brothers and sisters,
1TH.5.26	 Greet all the brothers and sisters
1TH.5.27	 I call on you solemnly in the Lord
1TH.5.28	 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2TH.1.1	 From Paul
2TH.1.2	 Grace and peace to you
2TH.1.3	 We ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters,
2TH.1.4	 As a result we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and afflictions you are enduring.
2TH.1.5	 This is evidence of God’s righteous judgment, to make you worthy
2TH.1.6	 For it is right
2TH.1.7	 and to you who are being afflicted to give rest together with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed
2TH.1.9	 They
2TH.1.10	 when he comes to be glorified among his saints and admired
2TH.1.11	 And in this regard we pray for you always, that our God will make you worthy of his calling
2TH.1.12	 that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to
2TH.2.1	 Now regarding the arrival
2TH.2.2	 not to be easily
2TH.2.3	 Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not arrive until the rebellion comes
2TH.2.4	 He
2TH.2.5	 Surely you recall
2TH.2.6	 And so
2TH.2.7	 For the hidden power of lawlessness
2TH.2.8	 and then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord
2TH.2.9	 The arrival of the lawless one
2TH.2.10	 and with every kind of evil deception directed against
2TH.2.11	 Consequently
2TH.2.12	 And so
2TH.2.13	 But we ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters
2TH.2.14	 He called you to this salvation
2TH.2.15	 Therefore, brothers and sisters,
2TH.2.16	 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope, 
2TH.2.17	 encourage your hearts and strengthen you
2TH.3.1	 Finally, pray for us, brothers and sisters,
2TH.3.2	 and that we may be delivered from perverse and evil people. For not all have faith. 
2TH.3.3	 But the Lord is faithful, and he
2TH.3.4	 And we are confident about you in the Lord that you are both doing – and will do – what we are commanding. 
2TH.3.5	 Now may the Lord direct your hearts toward the love of God
2TH.3.6	 But we command you, brothers and sisters,
2TH.3.7	 For you know yourselves how you must imitate us, because we did not behave without discipline
2TH.3.8	 and we did not eat anyone’s food without paying.
2TH.3.9	 It was not because we do not have that right, but to give ourselves as an example for you to imitate.
2TH.3.10	 For even when we were with you, we used to give you this command: “If anyone is not willing to work, neither should he eat.” 
2TH.3.11	 For we hear that some among you are living an undisciplined life,
2TH.3.12	 Now such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and so provide their own food to eat.
2TH.3.13	 But you, brothers and sisters,
2TH.3.14	 But if anyone does not obey our message through this letter, take note of him and do not associate closely with him, so that he may be ashamed. 
2TH.3.15	 Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
2TH.3.16	 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with you all. 
2TH.3.17	 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is how I write in every letter.
2TH.3.18	 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
1TI.1.1	 From Paul,
1TI.1.2	 to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!
1TI.1.3	 As I urged you when I was leaving for Macedonia, stay on in Ephesus
1TI.1.4	 nor to occupy themselves with myths and interminable genealogies.
1TI.1.5	 But the aim of our instruction
1TI.1.6	 Some have strayed from these and turned away to empty discussion. 
1TI.1.7	 They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are saying or the things they insist on so confidently.
1TI.1.8	 But we know that the law is good if someone uses it legitimately, 
1TI.1.9	 realizing that law
1TI.1.10	 sexually immoral people, practicing homosexuals,
1TI.1.11	 This
1TI.1.12	 I am grateful to the one who has strengthened me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he considered me faithful in putting me into ministry, 
1TI.1.13	 even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor, and an arrogant
1TI.1.14	 and our Lord’s grace was abundant, bringing faith and love in Christ Jesus.
1TI.1.15	 This saying
1TI.1.16	 But here is why I was treated with mercy: so that
1TI.1.17	 Now to the eternal king,
1TI.1.18	 I put this charge
1TI.1.19	 To do this
1TI.1.20	 Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan
1TI.2.1	 First of all, then, I urge that requests,
1TI.2.2	 even for kings
1TI.2.3	 Such prayer for all
1TI.2.4	 since he wants
1TI.2.5	 For there is one God and one intermediary
1TI.2.6	 who gave himself as a ransom for all, revealing God’s purpose at his appointed time.
1TI.2.7	 For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle – I am telling the truth;
1TI.2.8	 So I want the men
1TI.2.9	 Likewise
1TI.2.10	 but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess reverence for God. 
1TI.2.11	 A woman must learn
1TI.2.12	 But I do not allow
1TI.2.13	 For Adam was formed first and then Eve. 
1TI.2.14	 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, because she was fully deceived,
1TI.2.15	 But she will be delivered through childbearing,
1TI.3.1	 This saying
1TI.3.2	 The overseer
1TI.3.3	 not a drunkard, not violent, but gentle, not contentious, free from the love of money. 
1TI.3.4	 He must manage his own household well and keep his children in control without losing his dignity.
1TI.3.5	 But if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God? 
1TI.3.6	 He must not be a recent convert or he may become arrogant
1TI.3.7	 And he must be well thought of by
1TI.3.8	 Deacons likewise must be dignified,
1TI.3.9	 holding to the mystery of the faith
1TI.3.10	 And these also must be tested first and then let them serve as deacons if they are found blameless. 
1TI.3.11	 Likewise also their wives
1TI.3.12	 Deacons must be husbands of one wife
1TI.3.13	 For those who have served well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves
1TI.3.14	 I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these instructions
1TI.3.15	 in case I am delayed, to let you know how people ought to conduct themselves
1TI.3.16	 And we all agree,
1TI.3.16	He
1TI.3.16	vindicated by the Spirit,
1TI.3.16	seen by angels,
1TI.3.16	proclaimed among Gentiles,
1TI.3.16	believed on in the world,
1TI.3.16	taken up in glory.
1TI.4.1	 Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the later times some will desert the faith and occupy themselves
1TI.4.2	 influenced by the hypocrisy of liars
1TI.4.3	 They will prohibit marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 
1TI.4.4	 For every creation of God is good and no food
1TI.4.5	 For it is sanctified by God’s word and by prayer.
1TI.4.6	 By pointing out such things to the brothers and sisters,
1TI.4.7	 But reject those myths
1TI.4.8	 For “physical exercise
1TI.4.9	 This saying
1TI.4.10	 In fact this is why
1TI.4.11	 Command and teach these things. 
1TI.4.12	 Let no one look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in your speech, conduct, love, faithfulness,
1TI.4.13	 Until I come, give attention to the public reading of scripture,
1TI.4.14	 Do not neglect the spiritual gift you have,
1TI.4.15	 Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that everyone will see your progress.
1TI.4.16	 Be conscientious about how you live and what you teach.
1TI.5.1	 Do not address an older man harshly
1TI.5.2	 older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters – with complete purity.
1TI.5.3	 Honor
1TI.5.4	 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should first learn to fulfill their duty
1TI.5.5	 But the widow who is truly in need, and completely on her own,
1TI.5.6	 But the one who lives for pleasure is dead even
1TI.5.7	 Reinforce
1TI.5.8	 But if someone does not provide for his own,
1TI.5.9	 No widow should be put on the list
1TI.5.10	 and has a reputation for good works: as one who has raised children,
1TI.5.11	 But do not accept younger widows on the list,
1TI.5.12	 and so incur judgment for breaking their former pledge.
1TI.5.13	 And besides that, going around
1TI.5.14	 So I want younger women to marry, raise children, and manage a household, in order to give the adversary no opportunity to vilify us.
1TI.5.15	 For some have already wandered away to follow Satan.
1TI.5.16	 If a believing woman
1TI.5.17	 Elders who provide effective leadership
1TI.5.18	 For the scripture says, “
1TI.5.19	 Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it can be confirmed 
1TI.5.20	 Those guilty of sin
1TI.5.21	 Before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, I solemnly charge you to carry out these commands without prejudice or favoritism of any kind.
1TI.5.22	 Do not lay hands on anyone
1TI.5.23	 (Stop drinking just water, but use a little wine for your digestion
1TI.5.24	 The sins of some people are obvious, going before them into judgment, but for others, they show up later.
1TI.5.25	 Similarly good works are also obvious, and the ones that are not cannot remain hidden.
1TI.6.1	 Those who are under the yoke as slaves
1TI.6.2	 But those who have believing masters must not show them less respect
1TI.6.2	Teach them and exhort them about these things.
1TI.6.3	 If someone spreads false teachings
1TI.6.4	 he is conceited and understands nothing, but has an unhealthy interest in controversies and verbal disputes. This gives rise to envy, dissension, slanders, evil suspicions, 
1TI.6.5	 and constant bickering by people corrupted in their minds and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness
1TI.6.6	 Now godliness combined with contentment brings great profit. 
1TI.6.7	 For we have brought nothing into this world and so
1TI.6.8	 But if we have food and shelter, we will be satisfied with that.
1TI.6.9	 Those who long to be rich, however, stumble into temptation and a trap and many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 
1TI.6.10	 For the love of money is the root
1TI.6.11	 But you, as a person dedicated to God,
1TI.6.12	 Compete well
1TI.6.13	 I charge you
1TI.6.14	 to obey
1TI.6.15	 – whose appearing
1TI.6.16	 He alone possesses immortality and lives in unapproachable light, whom no human has ever seen or is able to see. To him be honor and eternal power! Amen.
1TI.6.17	 Command those who are rich in this world’s goods
1TI.6.18	 Tell them to do good,
1TI.6.19	 In this way they will save up
1TI.6.20	 O Timothy, protect what has been entrusted to you. Avoid
1TI.6.21	 By professing it, some have strayed from the faith.
2TI.1.1	 From Paul,
2TI.1.2	 to Timothy, my dear child. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!
2TI.1.3	 I am thankful to God, whom I have served with a clear conscience as my ancestors did,
2TI.1.4	 As I remember your tears, I long to see you,
2TI.1.5	 I recall
2TI.1.6	 Because of this I remind you to rekindle God’s gift that you possess
2TI.1.7	 For God did not give us a Spirit
2TI.1.8	 So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord
2TI.1.9	 He is the one who saved us
2TI.1.10	 but now made visible through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. He
2TI.1.11	 For this gospel
2TI.1.12	 Because of this, in fact, I suffer as I do.
2TI.1.13	 Hold to the standard
2TI.1.14	 Protect that good thing
2TI.1.15	 You know that everyone in the province of Asia
2TI.1.16	 May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my imprisonment.
2TI.1.17	 But when he arrived in Rome,
2TI.1.18	 May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day!
2TI.2.1	 So you, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.2	 And entrust what you heard me say
2TI.2.3	 Take your share of suffering
2TI.2.4	 No one in military service gets entangled in matters of everyday life; otherwise he will not please
2TI.2.5	 Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he will not be crowned as the winner
2TI.2.6	 The farmer who works hard ought to have the first share of the crops. 
2TI.2.7	 Think about what I am saying and
2TI.2.8	 Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David;
2TI.2.9	 for which I suffer hardship to the point of imprisonment
2TI.2.10	 So I endure all things for the sake of those chosen by God,
2TI.2.11	 This saying
2TI.2.11	If we died with him, we will also live with him.
2TI.2.12	 If we endure, we will also reign with him.
2TI.2.12	If we deny
2TI.2.13	 If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, since he cannot deny himself.
2TI.2.14	 Remind people
2TI.2.15	 Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately.
2TI.2.16	 But avoid profane chatter,
2TI.2.17	 and their message will spread its infection
2TI.2.18	 They have strayed from the truth
2TI.2.19	 However, God’s solid foundation remains standing, bearing this seal: “
2TI.2.20	 Now in a wealthy home
2TI.2.21	 So if someone cleanses himself of such behavior,
2TI.2.22	 But keep away from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace, in company with others
2TI.2.23	 But reject foolish and ignorant
2TI.2.24	 And the Lord’s slave
2TI.2.25	 correcting
2TI.2.26	 and they will come to their senses and escape the devil’s trap where they are held captive
2TI.3.1	 But understand this, that in the last days difficult
2TI.3.2	 For people
2TI.3.3	 unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, opposed to what is good, 
2TI.3.4	 treacherous, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God. 
2TI.3.5	 They will maintain the outward appearance
2TI.3.6	 For some of these insinuate themselves
2TI.3.7	 Such women are always seeking instruction,
2TI.3.8	 And just as Jannes and Jambres
2TI.3.9	 But they will not go much further,
2TI.3.10	 You, however,
2TI.3.11	 as well as the persecutions and sufferings
2TI.3.12	 Now in fact all who want to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
2TI.3.13	 But evil people and charlatans will go from bad to worse,
2TI.3.14	 You, however, must continue
2TI.3.15	 and how from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	 Every scripture
2TI.3.17	 that the person dedicated to God
2TI.4.1	 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: 
2TI.4.2	 Preach the message,
2TI.4.3	 For there will be a time when people
2TI.4.4	 And they will turn away from hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths.
2TI.4.5	 You, however, be self-controlled
2TI.4.6	 For I am already being poured out as an offering, and the time for me to depart
2TI.4.7	 I have competed well;
2TI.4.8	 Finally the crown of righteousness is reserved for me. The Lord, the righteous Judge, will award it to me in that day – and not to me only, but also to all who have set their affection on
2TI.4.9	 Make every effort to come to me soon. 
2TI.4.10	 For Demas deserted me, since he loved
2TI.4.11	 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is a great help
2TI.4.12	 Now I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
2TI.4.13	 When you come, bring with you the cloak I left in Troas with Carpas and the scrolls, especially the parchments. 
2TI.4.14	 Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm.
2TI.4.15	 You be on guard against him
2TI.4.16	 At my first defense no one appeared in my support; instead they all deserted me – may they not be held accountable for it. 
2TI.4.17	 But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message
2TI.4.18	 The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed and will bring me safely
2TI.4.19	 Greetings to
2TI.4.20	 Erastus stayed in Corinth.
2TI.4.21	 Make every effort to come before winter. Greetings to you from Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters.
2TI.4.22	 The Lord
TIT.1.1	 From Paul,
TIT.1.2	 in hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the ages began.
TIT.1.3	 But now in his own time
TIT.1.4	 To Titus, my genuine son in a common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior!
TIT.1.5	 The reason I left you in Crete was to set in order the remaining matters and to appoint elders in every town, as I directed you. 
TIT.1.6	 An elder must be blameless,
TIT.1.7	 For the overseer
TIT.1.8	 Instead he must be hospitable, devoted to what is good, sensible, upright, devout, and self-controlled. 
TIT.1.9	 He must hold firmly to the faithful message as it has been taught,
TIT.1.10	 For there are many
TIT.1.11	 who must be silenced because they mislead whole families by teaching for dishonest gain what ought not to be taught. 
TIT.1.12	 A certain one of them, in fact, one of their own prophets, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”
TIT.1.13	 Such testimony is true. For this reason rebuke them sharply that they may be healthy in the faith 
TIT.1.14	 and not pay attention to Jewish myths
TIT.1.15	 All is pure to those who are pure. But to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their minds and consciences are corrupted. 
TIT.1.16	 They profess to know God but with their deeds they deny him, since they are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good deed.
TIT.2.1	 But as for you, communicate the behavior that goes with
TIT.2.2	 Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled,
TIT.2.3	 Older women likewise are to exhibit behavior fitting for those who are holy, not slandering, not slaves to excessive drinking, but teaching what is good. 
TIT.2.4	 In this way
TIT.2.5	 to be self-controlled,
TIT.2.6	 Encourage younger men likewise to be self-controlled,
TIT.2.7	 showing yourself to be an example of good works in every way. In your teaching show integrity, dignity, 
TIT.2.8	 and a sound message that cannot be criticized, so that any opponent will be at a loss,
TIT.2.9	 Slaves
TIT.2.10	 not pilfering, but showing all good faith,
TIT.2.11	 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people.
TIT.2.12	 It trains us
TIT.2.13	 as we wait for the happy fulfillment of our hope in the glorious appearing
TIT.2.14	 He
TIT.2.15	 So communicate these things with the sort of exhortation or rebuke
TIT.3.1	 Remind them to be subject to rulers and
TIT.3.2	 They must not slander
TIT.3.3	 For we too were once foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to various passions and desires, spending our lives in evil and envy, hateful and hating one another. 
TIT.3.4	 But “when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, 
TIT.3.5	 he saved us not by works of righteousness that we have done but on the basis of his mercy, through the washing of the new birth and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, 
TIT.3.6	 whom he poured out on us in full measure
TIT.3.7	 And so,
TIT.3.8	 This saying
TIT.3.9	 But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies,
TIT.3.10	 Reject a divisive person after one or two warnings. 
TIT.3.11	 You know
TIT.3.12	 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 
TIT.3.13	 Make every effort to help
TIT.3.14	 Here is another way that our people
TIT.3.15	 Everyone with me greets you. Greet those who love us in the faith.
PHM.1.1	 From Paul,
PHM.1.2	 to Apphia
PHM.1.3	 Grace and peace to you
PHM.1.4	 I always thank my God
PHM.1.5	 because I hear
PHM.1.6	 I pray
PHM.1.7	 I
PHM.1.8	 So, although I have quite a lot of confidence in Christ and could command you to do what is proper, 
PHM.1.9	 I would rather appeal
PHM.1.10	 I am appealing
PHM.1.11	 who was formerly useless to you, but is now useful to you
PHM.1.12	 I have sent
PHM.1.13	 I wanted to keep him so that he could serve me in your place
PHM.1.14	 However,
PHM.1.15	 For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a little while, so that you would have him back eternally,
PHM.1.16	 no longer as a slave,
PHM.1.17	 Therefore if you regard me as a partner, accept him as you would me. 
PHM.1.18	 Now if he has defrauded you of anything or owes you anything, charge what he owes
PHM.1.19	 I, Paul, have written
PHM.1.20	 Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
PHM.1.21	 Since I was confident that you would obey, I wrote to you, because I knew that you would do even more than
PHM.1.22	 At the same time also, prepare a place for me to stay, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you.
PHM.1.23	 Epaphras,
PHM.1.24	 Mark, Aristarchus,
PHM.1.25	 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
HEB.1.1	 After God spoke long ago
HEB.1.2	 in these last days he has spoken to us in a son,
HEB.1.3	 The Son is
HEB.1.4	 Thus he became
HEB.1.5	 For to which of the angels did God
HEB.1.6	 But when he again brings
HEB.1.7	 And he says
HEB.1.8	 but of
HEB.1.8	“
HEB.1.9	”
HEB.1.10	 And, 
HEB.1.10	“
HEB.1.12	like a garment
HEB.1.12	”
HEB.1.13	 But to which of the angels
HEB.1.14	 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to serve those
HEB.2.1	 Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. 
HEB.2.2	 For if the message spoken through angels
HEB.2.3	 how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him, 
HEB.2.4	 while God confirmed their witness
HEB.2.5	 For he did not put the world to come,
HEB.2.6	 Instead someone testified somewhere: 
HEB.2.6	“
HEB.2.8	For when he 
HEB.2.9	 but we see Jesus, who was made 
HEB.2.10	 For it was fitting for him, for whom and through whom all things exist,
HEB.2.11	 For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have the same origin,
HEB.2.12	 saying, “
HEB.2.13	 Again he says,
HEB.2.14	 Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he likewise shared in
HEB.2.15	 and set free those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death. 
HEB.2.16	 For surely his concern is not for angels, but he is concerned for Abraham’s descendants. 
HEB.2.17	 Therefore he had
HEB.2.18	 For since he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
HEB.3.1	 Therefore, holy brothers and sisters,
HEB.3.2	 who is faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses was also in God’s
HEB.3.3	 For he has come to deserve greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself! 
HEB.3.4	 For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 
HEB.3.5	 Now Moses was 
HEB.3.6	 But Christ
HEB.3.7	 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,
HEB.3.7	“
HEB.3.8	 “
HEB.3.9	 “
HEB.3.10	 “
HEB.3.11	 “
HEB.3.12	 See to it,
HEB.3.13	 But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” that none of you may become hardened by sin’s deception. 
HEB.3.14	 For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence
HEB.3.15	 As it says,
HEB.3.16	 For which ones heard and rebelled? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under Moses’ leadership?
HEB.3.17	 And against whom was God
HEB.3.18	 And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient? 
HEB.3.19	 So
HEB.4.1	 Therefore we must be wary
HEB.4.2	 For we had good news proclaimed to us just as they did. But the message they heard did them no good, since they did not join in
HEB.4.3	 For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, “
HEB.4.4	 For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “
HEB.4.5	 but to repeat the text cited earlier:
HEB.4.6	 Therefore it remains for some to enter it, yet those to whom it was previously proclaimed did not enter because of disobedience. 
HEB.4.7	 So God
HEB.4.8	 For if Joshua had given them rest, God
HEB.4.9	 Consequently a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God. 
HEB.4.10	 For the one who enters God’s
HEB.4.11	 Thus we must make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of disobedience. 
HEB.4.12	 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart. 
HEB.4.13	 And no creature is hidden from God,
HEB.4.14	 Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. 
HEB.4.15	 For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin. 
HEB.4.16	 Therefore let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help.
HEB.5.1	 For every high priest is taken from among the people
HEB.5.2	 He is able to deal compassionately with those who are ignorant and erring, since he also is subject to weakness, 
HEB.5.3	 and for this reason he is obligated to make sin offerings for himself as well as for the people. 
HEB.5.4	 And no one assumes this honor
HEB.5.5	 So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming high priest, but the one who glorified him was God,
HEB.5.6	 as also in another place God
HEB.5.7	 During his earthly life
HEB.5.8	 Although he was a son, he learned obedience through the things he suffered.
HEB.5.9	 And by being perfected in this way, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, 
HEB.5.10	 and he was designated
HEB.5.11	 On this topic we have much to say
HEB.5.12	 For though you should in fact be teachers by this time,
HEB.5.13	 For everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness, because he is an infant. 
HEB.5.14	 But solid food is for the mature, whose perceptions are trained by practice to discern both good and evil.
HEB.6.1	 Therefore we must progress beyond
HEB.6.2	 teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 
HEB.6.3	 And this is what we intend to do,
HEB.6.4	 For it is impossible in the case of those who have once been enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift, become partakers of the Holy Spirit, 
HEB.6.5	 tasted the good word of God and the miracles of the coming age, 
HEB.6.6	 and then have committed apostasy,
HEB.6.7	 For the ground that has soaked up the rain that frequently falls on
HEB.6.8	 But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is useless and about to be cursed;
HEB.6.9	 But in your case, dear friends, even though we speak like this, we are convinced of better things relating to salvation. 
HEB.6.10	 For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love you have demonstrated for his name, in having served and continuing to serve the saints. 
HEB.6.11	 But we passionately want each of you to demonstrate the same eagerness for the fulfillment of your hope until the end, 
HEB.6.12	 so that you may not be sluggish,
HEB.6.13	 Now when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself, 
HEB.6.14	 saying, “
HEB.6.15	 And so by persevering, Abraham
HEB.6.16	 For people
HEB.6.17	 In the same way
HEB.6.18	 so that we who have found refuge in him
HEB.6.19	 We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, sure and steadfast, which reaches inside behind the curtain,
HEB.6.20	 where Jesus our forerunner entered on our behalf, since he became 
HEB.7.1	 Now this 
HEB.7.2	 To him
HEB.7.3	 Without father, without mother, without genealogy, he has neither beginning of days nor end of life but is like the son of God, and he remains a priest for all time. 
HEB.7.4	 But see how great he must be, if
HEB.7.5	 And those of the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office
HEB.7.6	 But Melchizedek
HEB.7.7	 Now without dispute the inferior is blessed by the superior, 
HEB.7.8	 and in one case tithes are received by mortal men, while in the other by him who is affirmed to be alive. 
HEB.7.9	 And it could be said that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid a tithe through Abraham. 
HEB.7.10	 For he was still in his ancestor Abraham’s loins
HEB.7.11	 So if perfection had in fact been possible through the Levitical priesthood – for on that basis
HEB.7.12	 For when the priesthood changes, a change in the law must come
HEB.7.13	 Yet the one these things are spoken about belongs to
HEB.7.14	 For it is clear that our Lord is descended from Judah, yet Moses said nothing about priests in connection with that tribe. 
HEB.7.15	 And this is even clearer if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, 
HEB.7.16	 who has become a priest not by a legal regulation about physical descent
HEB.7.17	 For here is the testimony about him:
HEB.7.18	 On the one hand a former command is set aside
HEB.7.19	 for the law made nothing perfect. On the other hand a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God. 
HEB.7.20	 And since
HEB.7.21	 but Jesus
HEB.7.22	 accordingly Jesus has become the guarantee
HEB.7.23	 And the others
HEB.7.24	 but he holds his priesthood permanently since he lives forever. 
HEB.7.25	 So he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. 
HEB.7.26	 For it is indeed fitting for us to have such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. 
HEB.7.27	 He has no need to do every day what those priests do, to offer sacrifices first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people, since he did this in offering himself once for all. 
HEB.7.28	 For the law appoints as high priests men subject to weakness,
HEB.8.1	 Now the main point of what we are saying is this:
HEB.8.2	 a minister in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up. 
HEB.8.3	 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. So this one too had to have something to offer. 
HEB.8.4	 Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer
HEB.8.5	 The place where they serve is
HEB.8.6	 But
HEB.8.7	 For if that first covenant had been faultless, no one would have looked for a second one.
HEB.8.8	 But
HEB.8.8	“
HEB.8.9	 “
HEB.8.10	 “
HEB.8.11	 “
HEB.8.12	 “
HEB.8.13	 When he speaks of a new covenant,
HEB.9.1	 Now the first covenant,
HEB.9.2	 For a tent was prepared, the outer one,
HEB.9.3	 And after the second curtain there was a tent called the holy of holies. 
HEB.9.4	 It contained the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered entirely with gold. In this ark
HEB.9.5	 And above the ark
HEB.9.6	 So with these things prepared like this, the priests enter continually into the outer tent
HEB.9.7	 But only the high priest enters once a year into the inner tent,
HEB.9.8	 The Holy Spirit is making clear that the way into the holy place had not yet appeared as long as the old tabernacle
HEB.9.9	 This was a symbol for the time then present, when gifts and sacrifices were offered that could not perfect the conscience of the worshiper. 
HEB.9.10	 They served only for matters of food and drink
HEB.9.11	 But now Christ has come
HEB.9.12	 and he entered once for all into the most holy place not by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood, and so he himself secured
HEB.9.13	 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled consecrated them and provided ritual purity,
HEB.9.14	 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our
HEB.9.15	 And so he is the mediator
HEB.9.16	 For where there is a will, the death of the one who made it must be proven.
HEB.9.17	 For a will takes effect only at death, since it carries no force while the one who made it is alive. 
HEB.9.18	 So even the first covenant was inaugurated with blood.
HEB.9.19	 For when Moses had spoken every command to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, 
HEB.9.20	 and said, “
HEB.9.21	 And both the tabernacle and all the utensils of worship he likewise sprinkled with blood. 
HEB.9.22	 Indeed according to the law almost everything was purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. 
HEB.9.23	 So it was necessary for the sketches
HEB.9.24	 For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with hands – the representation
HEB.9.25	 And he did not enter to offer
HEB.9.26	 for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the consummation of the ages to put away sin by his sacrifice. 
HEB.9.27	 And just as people
HEB.9.28	 so also, after Christ was offered once to 
HEB.10.1	 For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore completely unable, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, to perfect those who come to worship.
HEB.10.2	 For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have
HEB.10.3	 But in those sacrifices
HEB.10.4	 For the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sins.
HEB.10.5	 So when he came into the world, he said,
HEB.10.5	“
HEB.10.6	 “
HEB.10.7	 “
HEB.10.8	 When he says above, “
HEB.10.9	 then he says, “
HEB.10.10	 By his will
HEB.10.11	 And every priest stands day after day
HEB.10.12	 But when this priest
HEB.10.13	 where he is now waiting
HEB.10.14	 For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy. 
HEB.10.15	 And the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us, for after saying,
HEB.10.16	 “
HEB.10.17	 then he says,
HEB.10.18	 Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
HEB.10.19	 Therefore, brothers and sisters,
HEB.10.20	 by the fresh and living way that he inaugurated for us
HEB.10.21	 and since we have a great priest
HEB.10.22	 let us draw near with a sincere heart in the assurance that faith brings,
HEB.10.23	 And let us hold unwaveringly to the hope that we confess, for the one who made the promise is trustworthy. 
HEB.10.24	 And let us take thought of how to spur one another on to love and good works,
HEB.10.25	 not abandoning our own meetings, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and even more so because you see the day
HEB.10.26	 For if we deliberately keep on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins is left for us,
HEB.10.27	 but only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and 
HEB.10.28	 Someone who rejected the law of Moses was put to death
HEB.10.29	 How much greater punishment do you think that person deserves who has contempt for
HEB.10.30	 For we know the one who said, “
HEB.10.31	 It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	 But remember the former days when you endured a harsh conflict of suffering after you were enlightened. 
HEB.10.33	 At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way. 
HEB.10.34	 For in fact you shared the sufferings of those in prison,
HEB.10.35	 So do not throw away your confidence, because it
HEB.10.36	 For you need endurance in order to do God’s will and so receive what is promised.
HEB.10.37	 For 
HEB.10.39	 But we are not among those who shrink back and thus perish, but are among those who have faith and preserve their souls.
HEB.11.1	 Now faith is being sure of what we hope for, being convinced of what we do not see. 
HEB.11.2	 For by it the people of old
HEB.11.3	 By faith we understand that the worlds
HEB.11.4	 By faith Abel offered God a greater sacrifice than Cain, and through his faith
HEB.11.5	 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death, and he was not to be found because God took him up. For before his removal he had been commended as having pleased God. 
HEB.11.6	 Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. 
HEB.11.7	 By faith Noah, when he was warned about things not yet seen, with reverent regard
HEB.11.8	 By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place he would later receive as an inheritance, and he went out without understanding where he was going. 
HEB.11.9	 By faith he lived as a foreigner
HEB.11.10	 For he was looking forward to the city with firm foundations,
HEB.11.11	 By faith, even though Sarah herself was barren and he was too old,
HEB.11.12	 So in fact children
HEB.11.13	 These all died in faith without receiving the things promised,
HEB.11.14	 For those who speak in such a way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. 
HEB.11.15	 In fact, if they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. 
HEB.11.16	 But as it is,
HEB.11.17	 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac. He had received the promises,
HEB.11.18	 God had told him, “
HEB.11.19	 and he reasoned
HEB.11.20	 By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the future. 
HEB.11.21	 By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and 
HEB.11.22	 By faith Joseph, at the end of his life,
HEB.11.23	 By faith, when Moses was born, his parents hid him
HEB.11.24	 By faith, when he grew up, Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 
HEB.11.25	 choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to enjoy sin’s fleeting pleasure. 
HEB.11.26	 He regarded abuse suffered for Christ
HEB.11.27	 By faith he left Egypt without fearing the king’s anger, for he persevered as though he could see the one who is invisible. 
HEB.11.28	 By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood,
HEB.11.29	 By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry ground, but when the Egyptians tried it, they were swallowed up. 
HEB.11.30	 By faith the walls of Jericho
HEB.11.31	 By faith Rahab the prostitute escaped the destruction of
HEB.11.32	 And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets. 
HEB.11.33	 Through faith they conquered kingdoms, administered justice,
HEB.11.34	 quenched raging fire,
HEB.11.35	 and women received back their dead raised to life.
HEB.11.36	 And others experienced mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. 
HEB.11.37	 They were stoned, sawed apart,
HEB.11.38	 (the world was not worthy of them); they wandered in deserts and mountains and caves and openings in the earth. 
HEB.11.39	 And these all were commended
HEB.11.40	 For God had provided something better for us, so that they would be made perfect together with us.
HEB.12.1	 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,
HEB.12.2	 keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith. For the joy set out for him he endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and 
HEB.12.3	 Think of him who endured such opposition against himself by sinners, so that you may not grow weary in your souls and give up. 
HEB.12.4	 You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed
HEB.12.5	 And have you forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons?
HEB.12.5	“
HEB.12.6	 “
HEB.12.7	 Endure your suffering
HEB.12.8	 But if you do not experience discipline,
HEB.12.9	 Besides, we have experienced discipline from
HEB.12.10	 For they disciplined us for a little while as seemed good to them, but he does so for our benefit, that we may share his holiness. 
HEB.12.11	 Now all discipline seems painful at the time, not joyful.
HEB.12.12	 Therefore, 
HEB.12.13	 and 
HEB.12.14	 Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness,
HEB.12.15	 See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God, that no one be like 
HEB.12.16	 And see to it that no one becomes
HEB.12.17	 For you know that
HEB.12.18	 For you have not come to something that can be touched,
HEB.12.19	 and the blast of a trumpet and a voice uttering words
HEB.12.20	 For they could not bear what was commanded: “
HEB.12.21	 In fact, the scene
HEB.12.22	 But you have come to Mount Zion, the city
HEB.12.23	 and congregation of the firstborn, who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous, who have been made perfect, 
HEB.12.24	 and to Jesus, the mediator
HEB.12.25	 Take care not to refuse the one who is speaking! For if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less shall we, if we reject the one who warns from heaven? 
HEB.12.26	 Then his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “
HEB.12.27	 Now this phrase “
HEB.12.28	 So since we are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us give thanks, and through this let us offer worship pleasing to God in devotion and awe. 
HEB.12.29	 For our 
HEB.13.1	 Brotherly love must continue. 
HEB.13.2	 Do not neglect hospitality, because through it some have entertained angels without knowing it.
HEB.13.3	 Remember those in prison as though you were in prison with them,
HEB.13.4	 Marriage must be honored among all and the marriage bed kept undefiled, for God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers. 
HEB.13.5	 Your conduct must be free from the love of money and you must be content with what you have, for he has said, “
HEB.13.6	 So we can say with confidence, “
HEB.13.7	 Remember your leaders, who spoke God’s message to you; reflect on the outcome of their lives and imitate their faith. 
HEB.13.8	 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever! 
HEB.13.9	 Do not be carried away by all sorts of strange teachings.
HEB.13.10	 We have an altar that those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat from. 
HEB.13.11	 For the bodies of those animals whose blood the high priest brings
HEB.13.12	 Therefore, to sanctify the people by his own blood, Jesus also suffered outside the camp. 
HEB.13.13	 We must go out to him, then, outside the camp, bearing the abuse he experienced.
HEB.13.14	 For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come. 
HEB.13.15	 Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, acknowledging his name. 
HEB.13.16	 And do not neglect to do good and to share what you have,
HEB.13.17	 Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls and will give an account for their work.
HEB.13.18	 Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to conduct ourselves rightly in every respect. 
HEB.13.19	 I especially ask you to pray
HEB.13.20	 Now may the God of peace who by the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, 
HEB.13.21	 equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in us
HEB.13.22	 Now I urge you, brothers and sisters,
HEB.13.23	 You should know that
HEB.13.24	 Greetings to all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy send you greetings. 
HEB.13.25	 Grace be with you all.
JAS.1.1	 From James,
JAS.1.2	 My brothers and sisters,
JAS.1.3	 because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 
JAS.1.4	 And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you will be perfect and complete, not deficient in anything. 
JAS.1.5	 But if anyone is deficient in wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without reprimand, and it will be given to him. 
JAS.1.6	 But he must ask in faith without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed around by the wind. 
JAS.1.7	 For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord, 
JAS.1.8	 since he is a double-minded individual,
JAS.1.9	 Now the believer
JAS.1.10	 But the rich person’s pride should be in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a wildflower in the meadow.
JAS.1.11	 For the sun rises with its heat and dries up the meadow; the petal of the flower falls off and its beauty is lost forever.
JAS.1.12	 Happy is the one
JAS.1.13	 Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted by evil,
JAS.1.14	 But each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires. 
JAS.1.15	 Then when desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is full grown, it gives birth to death. 
JAS.1.16	 Do not be led astray, my dear brothers and sisters.
JAS.1.17	 All generous giving and every perfect gift
JAS.1.18	 By his sovereign plan he gave us birth
JAS.1.19	 Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters!
JAS.1.20	 For human
JAS.1.21	 So put away all filth and evil excess and humbly
JAS.1.22	 But be sure you live out the message and do not merely listen to it and so deceive yourselves. 
JAS.1.23	 For if someone merely listens to the message and does not live it out, he is like someone
JAS.1.24	 For he gazes at himself and then goes out and immediately forgets
JAS.1.25	 But the one who peers into the perfect law of liberty and fixes his attention there,
JAS.1.26	 If someone thinks he is religious yet does not bridle his tongue, and so deceives his heart, his religion is futile. 
JAS.1.27	 Pure and undefiled religion before
JAS.2.1	 My brothers and sisters,
JAS.2.2	 For if someone
JAS.2.3	 do you pay attention to the one who is finely dressed and say,
JAS.2.4	 If so, have you not made distinctions
JAS.2.5	 Listen, my dear brothers and sisters!
JAS.2.6	 But you have dishonored the poor!
JAS.2.7	 Do they not blaspheme the good name of the one you belong to?
JAS.2.8	 But if you fulfill the royal law as expressed in this scripture,
JAS.2.9	 But if you show prejudice, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as violators.
JAS.2.10	 For the one who obeys the whole law but fails
JAS.2.11	 For he who said, “
JAS.2.12	 Speak and act as those who will be judged by a law that gives freedom.
JAS.2.13	 For judgment is merciless for the one who has shown no mercy. But mercy triumphs over
JAS.2.14	 What good is it, my brothers and sisters,
JAS.2.15	 If a brother or sister
JAS.2.16	 and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, keep warm and eat well,” but you do not give them what the body needs,
JAS.2.17	 So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead being by itself. 
JAS.2.18	 But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.”
JAS.2.19	 You believe that God is one; well and good.
JAS.2.20	 But would you like evidence,
JAS.2.21	 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? 
JAS.2.22	 You see that his faith was working together with his works and his faith was perfected by works. 
JAS.2.23	 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “
JAS.2.24	 You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. 
JAS.2.25	 And similarly, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another way? 
JAS.2.26	 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
JAS.3.1	 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters,
JAS.3.2	 For we all stumble
JAS.3.3	 And if we put bits into the mouths of horses to get them to obey us, then we guide their entire bodies.
JAS.3.4	 Look at ships too: Though they are so large and driven by harsh winds, they are steered by a tiny rudder wherever the pilot’s inclination directs. 
JAS.3.5	 So too the tongue is a small part of the body,
JAS.3.6	 And the tongue is a fire! The tongue represents
JAS.3.7	 For every kind of animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature
JAS.3.8	 But no human being can subdue the tongue; it is a restless
JAS.3.9	 With it we bless the Lord
JAS.3.10	 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. These things should not be so, my brothers and sisters.
JAS.3.11	 A spring does not pour out fresh water and bitter water from the same opening, does it? 
JAS.3.12	 Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers and sisters,
JAS.3.13	 Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct he should show his works done in the gentleness that wisdom brings.
JAS.3.14	 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfishness in your hearts, do not boast and tell lies against the truth. 
JAS.3.15	 Such
JAS.3.16	 For where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is disorder and every evil practice. 
JAS.3.17	 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, accommodating,
JAS.3.18	 And the fruit that consists of righteousness
JAS.4.1	 Where do the conflicts and where
JAS.4.2	 You desire and you do not have; you murder and envy and you cannot obtain; you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask; 
JAS.4.3	 you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly, so you can spend it on your passions.
JAS.4.4	 Adulterers, do you not know that friendship with the world means hostility toward God?
JAS.4.5	 Or do you think the scripture means nothing when it says,
JAS.4.6	 But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, “
JAS.4.7	 So submit to God. But resist the devil and he will flee from you. 
JAS.4.8	 Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and make your hearts pure, you double-minded.
JAS.4.9	 Grieve, mourn,
JAS.4.10	 Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.
JAS.4.11	 Do not speak against one another, brothers and sisters.
JAS.4.12	 But there is only one who is lawgiver and judge – the one who is able to save and destroy. On the other hand, who are you to judge your neighbor?
JAS.4.13	 Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that town
JAS.4.14	 You
JAS.4.15	 You ought to say instead,
JAS.4.16	 But as it is,
JAS.4.17	 So whoever knows what is good to do
JAS.5.1	 Come now, you rich! Weep and cry aloud
JAS.5.2	 Your riches have rotted and your clothing has become moth-eaten. 
JAS.5.3	 Your gold and silver have rusted and their rust will be a witness against you. It will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have hoarded treasure!
JAS.5.4	 Look, the pay you have held back from the workers who mowed your fields cries out against you, and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. 
JAS.5.5	 You have lived indulgently and luxuriously on the earth. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
JAS.5.6	 You have condemned and murdered the righteous person, although he does not resist you.
JAS.5.7	 So be patient, brothers and sisters,
JAS.5.8	 You also be patient and strengthen your hearts, for the Lord’s return is near. 
JAS.5.9	 Do not grumble against one another, brothers and sisters,
JAS.5.10	 As an example of suffering and patience, brothers and sisters,
JAS.5.11	 Think of how we regard
JAS.5.12	 And above all, my brothers and sisters,
JAS.5.13	 Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone in good spirits? He should sing praises. 
JAS.5.14	 Is anyone among you ill? He should summon the elders of the church, and they should pray for him and anoint
JAS.5.15	 And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up – and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
JAS.5.16	 So confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great effectiveness.
JAS.5.17	 Elijah was a human being
JAS.5.18	 Then
JAS.5.19	 My brothers and sisters,
JAS.5.20	 he should know that the one who turns a sinner back from his wandering path
1PE.1.1	 From Peter,
1PE.1.2	 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father by being set apart by the Spirit for obedience and for sprinkling
1PE.1.3	 Blessed be
1PE.1.4	 that is,
1PE.1.5	 who by God’s power are protected through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
1PE.1.6	 This brings you great joy,
1PE.1.7	 Such trials show the proven character of your faith,
1PE.1.8	 You
1PE.1.9	 because you are attaining the goal of your faith – the salvation of your souls.
1PE.1.10	 Concerning this salvation,
1PE.1.11	 They probed
1PE.1.12	 They were shown
1PE.1.13	 Therefore, get your minds ready for action
1PE.1.14	 Like obedient children, do not comply with
1PE.1.15	 but, like the Holy One who called you, become holy yourselves in all of your conduct, 
1PE.1.16	 for it is written, “
1PE.1.17	 And if you address as Father the one who impartially judges according to each one’s work, live out the time of your temporary residence here
1PE.1.18	 You know that from your empty way of life inherited from your ancestors you were ransomed – not by perishable things like silver or gold, 
1PE.1.19	 but by precious blood like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, namely Christ. 
1PE.1.20	 He was foreknown
1PE.1.21	 Through him you now trust
1PE.1.22	 You have purified
1PE.1.23	 You have been born anew, not from perishable but from imperishable seed, through the living and enduring word of God. 
1PE.1.24	 For
1PE.1.25	And this is the word that was proclaimed to you.
1PE.2.1	 So get rid of
1PE.2.2	 And
1PE.2.3	 if 
1PE.2.4	 So as you come to him,
1PE.2.5	 you yourselves, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood and to offer
1PE.2.6	 For it says
1PE.2.7	 So you who believe see
1PE.2.8	 and 
1PE.2.9	 But you are 
1PE.2.10	 You
1PE.2.11	 Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to keep away from fleshly desires that do battle against the soul, 
1PE.2.12	 and maintain good conduct
1PE.2.13	 Be subject to every human institution
1PE.2.14	 or to governors as those he commissions
1PE.2.15	 For God wants you
1PE.2.16	 Live
1PE.2.17	 Honor all people, love the family of believers,
1PE.2.18	 Slaves,
1PE.2.19	 For this finds God’s favor,
1PE.2.20	 For what credit is it if you sin and are mistreated and endure it? But if you do good and suffer and so endure, this finds favor with God.
1PE.2.21	 For to this you were called, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving an example for you to follow in his steps. 
1PE.2.22	 He
1PE.2.23	 When he was maligned, he
1PE.2.24	 He
1PE.2.25	 For you were 
1PE.3.1	 In the same way, wives, be subject to your own husbands. Then,
1PE.3.2	 when they see your pure and reverent conduct.
1PE.3.3	 Let your
1PE.3.4	 but the inner person
1PE.3.5	 For in the same way the holy women who hoped in God long ago adorned themselves by being subject to their husbands, 
1PE.3.6	 like Sarah who obeyed
1PE.3.7	 Husbands, in the same way, treat your wives with consideration as the weaker partners
1PE.3.8	 Finally, all of you be harmonious,
1PE.3.9	 Do not return evil for evil or insult for insult, but instead bless
1PE.3.10	 For 
1PE.3.13	 For
1PE.3.14	 But in fact, if you happen to suffer
1PE.3.15	 But set Christ
1PE.3.16	 Yet do it with courtesy and respect,
1PE.3.17	 For it is better to suffer for doing good, if God wills it,
1PE.3.18	 Because Christ also suffered
1PE.3.18	,
1PE.3.18	to bring you to God, 
1PE.3.18	by being put to death in the flesh 
1PE.3.18	but
1PE.3.19	 In it
1PE.3.20	 after they were disobedient long ago
1PE.3.21	 And this prefigured baptism, which now saves you
1PE.3.22	 who went into heaven and is at the right hand of God
1PE.4.1	 So, since Christ suffered
1PE.4.2	 in that he spends the rest of his time
1PE.4.3	 For the time that has passed was sufficient for you to do what the non-Christians
1PE.4.4	 So
1PE.4.5	 They will face a reckoning before
1PE.4.6	 Now it was for this very purpose
1PE.4.7	 For the culmination of all things is near. So be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of prayer.
1PE.4.8	 Above all keep
1PE.4.9	 Show hospitality
1PE.4.10	 Just as each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another
1PE.4.11	 Whoever speaks, let it be with
1PE.4.12	 Dear friends, do not be astonished
1PE.4.13	 But rejoice in the degree that you have shared in the sufferings of Christ, so that when his glory is revealed
1PE.4.14	 If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory,
1PE.4.15	 But let none of you suffer as a murderer or thief or criminal or as a troublemaker.
1PE.4.16	 But if you suffer as a Christian,
1PE.4.17	 For it is time for judgment to begin, starting with the house
1PE.4.18	 And 
1PE.4.19	 So then let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator as they do good.
1PE.5.1	 So as your fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings and as one who shares in the glory that will be revealed, I urge the elders among you: 
1PE.5.2	 Give a shepherd’s care to
1PE.5.3	 And do not lord it over
1PE.5.4	 Then
1PE.5.5	 In the same way, you who are younger,
1PE.5.6	 And God will exalt you in due time,
1PE.5.7	 by casting
1PE.5.8	 Be sober and alert. Your enemy the devil, 
1PE.5.9	 Resist him,
1PE.5.10	 And, after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ
1PE.5.11	 To him belongs
1PE.5.12	 Through Silvanus,
1PE.5.13	 The church
1PE.5.14	 Greet one another with a loving kiss.
2PE.1.1	 From Simeon
2PE.1.2	 May grace and peace be lavished on you
2PE.1.3	 I can pray this because his divine power

2PE.1.5	 For this very reason,
2PE.1.6	 to knowledge, self-control; to self-control, perseverance;
2PE.1.7	 to godliness, brotherly affection; to brotherly affection, unselfish
2PE.1.8	 For if
2PE.1.9	 But
2PE.1.10	 Therefore, brothers and sisters,
2PE.1.11	 For thus an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, will be richly provided for you.
2PE.1.12	 Therefore, I intend to remind you constantly
2PE.1.13	 Indeed, as long as I am in this tabernacle,
2PE.1.14	 since I know that my tabernacle will soon be removed,
2PE.1.15	 Indeed, I will also make every effort that, after my departure, you have a testimony of these things.
2PE.1.16	 For we did not follow cleverly concocted fables when we made known to you the power and return
2PE.1.17	 For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when that
2PE.1.18	 When this voice was conveyed from heaven, we ourselves
2PE.1.19	 Moreover,
2PE.1.20	 Above all, you do well if you recognize
2PE.1.21	 for no prophecy was ever borne of human impulse; rather, men
2PE.2.1	 But false prophets arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you.
2PE.2.2	 And many will follow their debauched lifestyles.
2PE.2.3	 And in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their
2PE.2.4	 For if God did not spare the angels who sinned,
2PE.2.5	 and if he did not spare the ancient world, but did protect Noah, a herald of righteousness, along with seven others,
2PE.2.6	 and if he turned to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah when he condemned them to destruction,
2PE.2.7	 and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man in anguish over the debauched lifestyle of lawless
2PE.2.8	 (for while he lived among them day after day, that righteous man was tormented in his righteous soul
2PE.2.9	 – if so,
2PE.2.10	 especially those who indulge their fleshly desires
2PE.2.10	Brazen and insolent,
2PE.2.11	 yet even
2PE.2.12	 But
2PE.2.13	 suffering harm as the wages for their harmful ways.
2PE.2.14	 Their eyes,
2PE.2.15	 By forsaking the right path they have gone astray, because they followed the way of Balaam son of Bosor,
2PE.2.16	 yet was rebuked
2PE.2.17	 These men
2PE.2.18	 For by speaking high-sounding but empty words
2PE.2.19	 Although these false teachers promise
2PE.2.20	 For if after they have escaped the filthy things
2PE.2.21	 For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than, having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them. 
2PE.2.22	 They are illustrations of this true proverb:
2PE.3.1	 Dear friends, this is already the second letter I have written
2PE.3.2	 I want you to recall
2PE.3.3	 Above all, understand this:
2PE.3.4	 and saying,
2PE.3.5	 For they deliberately suppress this fact,
2PE.3.6	 Through these things
2PE.3.7	 But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire, by being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.
2PE.3.8	 Now, dear friends, do not let this one thing escape your notice,
2PE.3.9	 The Lord is not slow concerning his promise,
2PE.3.10	 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief; when it comes,
2PE.3.11	 Since all these things are to melt away
2PE.3.12	 while waiting for and hastening
2PE.3.13	 But, according to his promise, we are waiting for
2PE.3.14	 Therefore, dear friends, since you are waiting for
2PE.3.15	 And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation,
2PE.3.16	 speaking of these things in all his letters.
2PE.3.17	 Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned,
2PE.3.18	 But grow in the grace and knowledge
1JN.1.1	 This is what we proclaim to you:
1JN.1.2	 and the life was revealed, and we have seen and testify and announce
1JN.1.3	 What we have seen and heard we announce
1JN.1.4	 Thus
1JN.1.5	 Now
1JN.1.6	 If we say we have fellowship with him and yet keep on walking
1JN.1.7	 But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses
1JN.1.8	 If we say we do not bear the guilt of sin,
1JN.1.9	 But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous,
1JN.1.10	 If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. 
1JN.2.1	 (My little children,
1JN.2.2	 and he himself is the atoning sacrifice
1JN.2.3	 Now
1JN.2.4	 The one who says “I have come to know God”
1JN.2.5	 But whoever obeys his
1JN.2.6	 The one who says he resides
1JN.2.7	 Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning.
1JN.2.8	 On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you which is true in him
1JN.2.9	 The one who says he is in the light but still hates
1JN.2.10	 The one who loves his fellow Christian
1JN.2.11	 But the one who hates his fellow Christian
1JN.2.12	 I am writing to you,
1JN.2.13	 I am writing to you, fathers, that
1JN.2.14	 I have written to you, children, that
1JN.2.15	 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him, 
1JN.2.16	 because all that is in the world (the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance produced by material possessions)
1JN.2.17	 And the world is passing away with all its desires, but the person who does the will of God remains
1JN.2.18	 Children, it is the last hour, and just as you heard that the antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists
1JN.2.19	 They went out from us, but they did not really belong
1JN.2.20	 Nevertheless you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.
1JN.2.21	 I have not written to you that
1JN.2.22	 Who is the liar but the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ
1JN.2.23	 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either. The person who confesses the Son has the Father also.
1JN.2.24	 As for you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain
1JN.2.25	 Now this
1JN.2.26	 These things I have written to you about those who are trying to deceive you.
1JN.2.27	 Now as for you, the anointing
1JN.2.28	 And now, little children, remain
1JN.2.29	 If you know that he is righteous, you also know
1JN.3.1	 (See what sort of love the Father has given to us: that
1JN.3.2	 Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be
1JN.3.3	 And everyone who has this hope focused
1JN.3.4	 Everyone who practices sin
1JN.3.5	 And you know that Jesus
1JN.3.6	 Everyone who resides
1JN.3.7	 Little children, let no one deceive you: The one who practices righteousness
1JN.3.8	 The one who practices sin is of the devil,
1JN.3.9	 Everyone who has been fathered
1JN.3.10	 By this
1JN.3.11	 For
1JN.3.12	 not like Cain
1JN.3.13	 Therefore do not be surprised, brothers and sisters,
1JN.3.14	 We know that
1JN.3.15	 Everyone who hates his fellow Christian
1JN.3.16	 We have come to know love by this:
1JN.3.17	 But whoever has the world’s possessions
1JN.3.18	 Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue but in deed and truth.
1JN.3.19	 And by this
1JN.3.20	 that
1JN.3.21	 Dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, we have confidence in the presence of God, 
1JN.3.22	 and
1JN.3.23	 Now
1JN.3.24	 And the person who keeps his commandments resides
1JN.4.1	 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit,
1JN.4.2	 By this
1JN.4.3	 but
1JN.4.4	 You are from God, little children, and have conquered them,
1JN.4.5	 They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world’s perspective and the world listens to them. 
1JN.4.6	 We are from God; the person who knows God listens to us, but
1JN.4.7	 Dear friends, let us love one another, because
1JN.4.8	 The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love.
1JN.4.9	 By this
1JN.4.10	 In this
1JN.4.11	 Dear friends, if God so loved us, then
1JN.4.12	 No one has seen God at any time.
1JN.4.13	 By this
1JN.4.14	 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior
1JN.4.15	 If anyone
1JN.4.16	 And we have come to know and to believe
1JN.4.17	 By this
1JN.4.18	 There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment.
1JN.4.19	 We love
1JN.4.20	 If anyone says
1JN.4.21	 And the commandment we have from him is this: that
1JN.5.1	 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ
1JN.5.2	 By this
1JN.5.3	 For
1JN.5.4	 because
1JN.5.4	This
1JN.5.5	 Now who is the person who has conquered the world except the one who believes that
1JN.5.6	 Jesus Christ is the one who came by water and blood – not by the water only, but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because
1JN.5.7	 For
1JN.5.8	 the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three are in agreement.
1JN.5.9	 If we accept the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because
1JN.5.10	 (The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son.)
1JN.5.11	 And this is the testimony: God
1JN.5.12	 The one who has the Son
1JN.5.13	 I have written these things
1JN.5.14	 And this is the confidence that we have before him: that
1JN.5.15	 And if we know
1JN.5.16	 If
1JN.5.17	 All unrighteousness
1JN.5.18	 We know that everyone fathered
1JN.5.19	 We know that we are from God,
1JN.5.20	 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us insight to know
1JN.5.21	 Little children, guard yourselves from idols.
2JN.1.1	 From
2JN.1.2	 because of the truth
2JN.1.3	 Grace, mercy, and
2JN.1.4	 I rejoiced greatly because I have found some
2JN.1.5	 But now
2JN.1.6	 (Now this is love: that we walk
2JN.1.7	 For
2JN.1.8	 Watch out, so that you do not lose the things we have worked for,
2JN.1.9	 Everyone
2JN.1.10	 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house and do not give him any greeting,
2JN.1.11	 because the person who gives him a greeting shares in his evil deeds.
2JN.1.12	 Though I have many other
2JN.1.13	 The children of your elect sister greet you.
3JN.1.1	 From
3JN.1.2	 Dear friend, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, just as it is well with your soul.
3JN.1.3	 For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified to your truth, just as you are living according to the truth.
3JN.1.4	 I have no greater joy than this: to hear
3JN.1.5	 Dear friend,
3JN.1.6	 They
3JN.1.7	 For they have gone forth
3JN.1.8	 Therefore we
3JN.1.9	 I wrote something to the church,
3JN.1.10	 Therefore, if I come,
3JN.1.11	 Dear friend, do not imitate what is bad but what is good.
3JN.1.12	 Demetrius
3JN.1.13	 I have many things to write to you, but I do not wish to write to you with
3JN.1.14	 But I hope to see you right away, and we will speak face to face.
3JN.1.15	 Peace be with you.
JUD.1.1	 From Jude,
JUD.1.2	 May mercy, peace, and love be lavished on you!
JUD.1.3	 Dear friends, although I have been eager to write to you
JUD.1.4	 For certain men
JUD.1.5	 Now I desire to remind you (even though you have been fully informed of these facts
JUD.1.6	 You also know that
JUD.1.7	 So also
JUD.1.8	 Yet these men,
JUD.1.9	 But even
JUD.1.10	 But these men do not understand the things they slander, and they are being destroyed by the very things that, like irrational animals, they instinctively comprehend.
JUD.1.11	 Woe to them! For they have traveled down Cain’s path,

JUD.1.13	 wild sea waves,

REV.2.6	 But you do have this going for you:
REV.2.7	 The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers,
REV.2.8	 “To

REV.2.16	 Therefore,
REV.2.17	 The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers,
REV.2.18	 “To

REV.2.25	 However, hold on to what you have until I come. 
REV.2.26	 And to the one who conquers
REV.2.27	and like clay jars he will break them to pieces,
REV.2.28	 just as I have received the right to rule

REV.3.1	 “To
REV.3.1	“This is the solemn pronouncement of

REV.4.1	 After these things I looked, and there was
REV.4.2	 Immediately I was in the Spirit,
REV.4.3	 And the one seated on it was like jasper
REV.4.4	 In
REV.4.5	 From
REV.4.6	 and in front of the throne was something like a sea of glass, like crystal.
REV.4.6	In
REV.4.7	 The
REV.4.8	 Each one of the four living creatures had six wings
REV.4.8	“
REV.4.8	Who was and who is, and who is still to come!”
REV.4.9	 And whenever the living creatures give glory, honor,
REV.4.10	 the twenty-four elders throw themselves to the ground
REV.4.11	 “You are worthy, our Lord and God,
REV.4.11	to receive glory and honor and power,
REV.4.11	since you created all things,
REV.4.11	and because of your will they existed and were created!”
REV.5.1	 Then
REV.5.2	 And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming in a loud voice: “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?” 
REV.5.3	 But
REV.5.4	 So
REV.5.5	 Then
REV.5.6	 Then
REV.5.7	 Then
REV.5.8	 and when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders threw themselves to the ground
REV.5.9	 They were singing a new song:
REV.5.9	“You are worthy to take the scroll
REV.5.9	and to open its seals
REV.5.9	because you were killed,
REV.5.9	and at the cost of your own blood
REV.5.9	persons
REV.5.10	 You have appointed
REV.5.11	 Then
REV.5.12	 all of whom
REV.5.12	“Worthy is the lamb who was killed
REV.5.12	to receive power and wealth 
REV.5.12	and wisdom and might 
REV.5.12	and honor and glory and praise!”
REV.5.13	 Then
REV.5.13	“To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb
REV.5.13	be praise, honor, glory, and ruling power
REV.5.14	 And the four living creatures were saying “Amen,” and the elders threw themselves to the ground
REV.6.1	 I looked on when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a thunderous voice,
REV.6.2	 So
REV.6.3	 Then
REV.6.4	 And another horse, fiery red,
REV.6.5	 Then
REV.6.6	 Then
REV.6.7	 Then
REV.6.8	 So
REV.6.9	 Now
REV.6.10	 They
REV.6.11	 Each
REV.6.12	 Then
REV.6.13	 and the stars in the sky
REV.6.14	 The sky
REV.6.15	 Then
REV.6.16	 They
REV.6.17	 because the great day of their
REV.7.1	 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth so no wind could blow on the earth, on the sea, or on any tree. 
REV.7.2	 Then
REV.7.3	 “Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants
REV.7.4	 Now
REV.7.5	 From the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed,
REV.7.5	from the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand,
REV.7.5	from the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand,
REV.7.6	 from the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand,
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand,
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand,
REV.7.7	 from the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand,
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand,
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand, 
REV.7.8	 from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand,
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand,
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed. 
REV.7.9	 After these things I looked, and here was
REV.7.10	 They were shouting out in a loud voice,
REV.7.10	“Salvation belongs to our God,
REV.7.10	to the one seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”
REV.7.11	 And all the angels stood
REV.7.12	 saying,
REV.7.12	“Amen! Praise and glory, 
REV.7.12	and wisdom and thanksgiving, 
REV.7.12	and honor and power and strength 
REV.7.12	be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!”
REV.7.13	 Then
REV.7.14	 So
REV.7.15	 For this reason they are before the throne of God, and they serve
REV.7.17	 because the Lamb in the middle of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to springs of living water, 
REV.8.1	 Now
REV.8.2	 Then
REV.8.3	 Another
REV.8.4	 The
REV.8.5	 Then
REV.8.6	 Now
REV.8.7	 The

REV.8.9	 and a third of the creatures

REV.10.1	 Then
REV.10.2	 He held
REV.10.3	 Then
REV.10.4	 When the seven thunders spoke, I was preparing to write, but
REV.10.5	 Then
REV.10.6	 and swore by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, and the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, “There will be no more delay!

REV.11.6	 These two have the power
REV.11.7	 When
REV.11.8	 Their
REV.11.9	 For three and a half days those from every
REV.11.10	 And those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate, even sending gifts to each other, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth. 
REV.11.11	 But
REV.11.12	 Then
REV.11.13	 Just then
REV.11.14	 The second woe has come and gone;
REV.11.15	 Then
REV.11.15	“The kingdom of the world 
REV.11.15	has become the kingdom of our Lord 
REV.11.15	and of his Christ,
REV.11.15	and he will reign for ever and ever.”
REV.11.16	 Then
REV.11.17	 with these words:
REV.11.17	“We give you thanks, Lord God, the All-Powerful,
REV.11.17	the one who is and who was,
REV.11.17	because you have taken your great power
REV.11.17	and begun to reign.
REV.11.18	 The
REV.11.18	but
REV.11.18	and the time has come for the dead to be judged,
REV.11.18	and the time has come to give to your servants,
REV.11.18	the prophets, their reward,
REV.11.18	as well as to the saints 
REV.11.18	and to those who revere
REV.11.18	and the time has come
REV.11.19	 Then
REV.12.1	 Then
REV.12.2	 She
REV.12.3	 Then
REV.12.4	 Now
REV.12.5	 So
REV.12.6	 and she
REV.12.7	 Then
REV.12.8	 But
REV.12.9	 So
REV.12.10	 Then
REV.12.10	“The salvation and the power
REV.12.10	and the kingdom of our God, 
REV.12.10	and the ruling authority
REV.12.10	because the accuser of our brothers and sisters,
REV.12.10	the one who accuses them day and night
REV.12.10	has been thrown down.
REV.12.11	 But
REV.12.11	by the blood of the Lamb
REV.12.11	and by the word of their testimony,
REV.12.11	and they did not love their lives
REV.12.12	 Therefore you heavens rejoice, and all who reside in them!
REV.12.12	But
REV.12.12	because the devil has come down to you! 
REV.12.12	He
REV.12.12	for he knows that he only has a little time!”
REV.12.13	 Now
REV.12.14	 But
REV.12.15	 Then
REV.12.16	 but
REV.12.17	 So
REV.12.18	 And the dragon
REV.13.1	 Then
REV.13.2	 Now
REV.13.3	 One of the beast’s
REV.13.4	 they worshiped the dragon because he had given ruling authority
REV.13.5	 The beast
REV.13.6	 So
REV.13.7	 The beast
REV.13.8	 and all those who live on the earth will worship the beast,
REV.13.9	 If anyone has an ear, he had better listen! 
REV.13.10	 If anyone is meant for captivity,
REV.13.10	into captivity he will go.
REV.13.10	If anyone is to be killed by the sword,
REV.13.10	then by the sword he must be killed.
REV.13.10	This
REV.13.11	 Then
REV.13.12	 He
REV.13.13	 He
REV.13.14	 and, by the signs he was permitted to perform on behalf of the beast, he deceived those who live on the earth. He told
REV.13.15	 The second beast
REV.13.16	 He also caused
REV.13.17	 Thus no one was allowed to buy
REV.13.18	 This calls for wisdom:
REV.14.1	 Then
REV.14.2	 I also heard a sound
REV.14.3	 and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No
REV.14.4	 These are the ones who have not defiled themselves
REV.14.5	 and no lie was found on their lips;
REV.14.6	 Then
REV.14.7	 He declared
REV.14.8	 A
REV.14.9	 A
REV.14.10	 that person
REV.14.11	 And the smoke from their
REV.14.12	 This requires
REV.14.13	 Then
REV.14.13	‘Blessed are the dead, 
REV.14.13	those who die in the Lord from this moment on!’”
REV.14.13	“Yes,” says the Spirit, “so they can rest from their hard work,
REV.14.14	 Then
REV.14.15	 Then
REV.14.16	 So
REV.14.17	 Then
REV.14.18	 Another
REV.14.19	 So
REV.14.20	 Then
REV.15.1	 Then
REV.15.2	 Then
REV.15.3	 They
REV.15.3	“Great and astounding are your deeds,
REV.15.3	Lord God, the All-Powerful!
REV.15.3	Just
REV.15.3	King over the nations!
REV.15.4	 Who will not fear you, O Lord, 
REV.15.4	and glorify
REV.15.4	All nations
REV.15.4	for your righteous acts
REV.15.5	 After
REV.15.6	 and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, dressed in clean bright linen, wearing wide golden belts
REV.15.7	 Then
REV.15.8	 and the temple was filled with smoke from God’s glory and from his power. Thus
REV.16.1	 Then
REV.16.2	 So
REV.16.3	 Next,
REV.16.4	 Then
REV.16.5	 Now
REV.16.5	“You are just
REV.16.5	the Holy One – because you have passed these judgments,
REV.16.6	 because they poured out the blood of your saints and prophets,
REV.16.6	so
REV.16.7	 Then
REV.16.8	 Then
REV.16.9	 Thus
REV.16.10	 Then
REV.16.11	 They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their sufferings
REV.16.12	 Then
REV.16.13	 Then
REV.16.14	 For they are the spirits of the demons performing signs who go out to the kings of the earth
REV.16.15	 (Look! I will come like a thief!
REV.16.15	Blessed is the one who stays alert and does not lose
REV.16.16	 Now
REV.16.17	 Finally
REV.16.18	 Then
REV.16.19	 The
REV.16.20	 Every
REV.16.21	 And gigantic hailstones, weighing about a hundred pounds
REV.17.1	 Then
REV.17.2	 with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality and the earth’s inhabitants got drunk with the wine of her immorality.”
REV.17.3	 So
REV.17.4	 Now
REV.17.5	 On
REV.17.6	 I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of those who testified to Jesus.
REV.17.7	 But
REV.17.8	 The beast you saw was, and is not, but is about to come up from the abyss
REV.17.9	 (This requires
REV.17.10	 five have fallen; one is,
REV.17.11	 The
REV.17.12	 The
REV.17.13	 These kings
REV.17.14	 They will make war with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those accompanying
REV.17.15	 Then
REV.17.16	 The
REV.17.17	 For God has put into their minds
REV.17.18	 As for
REV.18.1	 After these things I saw another angel, who possessed great authority, coming down out of heaven, and the earth was lit up by his radiance.
REV.18.2	 He
REV.18.2	“Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great!
REV.18.2	She
REV.18.2	a haunt
REV.18.2	a haunt for every unclean bird,
REV.18.2	a haunt for every unclean and detested beast.
REV.18.3	 For all the nations
REV.18.3	the wine of her immoral passion,
REV.18.3	and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her,
REV.18.3	and the merchants of the earth have gotten rich from the power of her sensual behavior.”
REV.18.4	 Then
REV.18.5	 because her sins have piled
REV.18.6	 Repay her the same way she repaid others;
REV.18.7	 As much as
REV.18.8	 For this reason, she will experience her plagues
REV.18.9	 Then
REV.18.10	 They will stand a long way off because they are afraid of her torment, and will say,
REV.18.10	“Woe, woe, O great city,
REV.18.10	Babylon the powerful city!
REV.18.10	For in a single hour your doom
REV.18.11	 Then
REV.18.12	 cargo such as gold, silver,
REV.18.13	 cinnamon, spice,
REV.18.14	 (The ripe fruit
REV.18.14	has gone from you,
REV.18.14	and all your luxury
REV.18.14	have gone from you – 
REV.18.14	they will never ever be found again!)
REV.18.15	 The merchants who sold
REV.18.16	 saying, 
REV.18.16	“Woe, woe, O great city – 
REV.18.16	dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet clothing,
REV.18.16	and adorned with gold,
REV.18.17	 because in a single hour such great wealth has been destroyed!”
REV.18.17	And every ship’s captain,
REV.18.18	 and began to shout
REV.18.19	 And they threw dust on their heads and were shouting with weeping and mourning,
REV.18.19	“Woe, Woe, O great city – 
REV.18.19	in which all those who had ships on the sea got rich from her wealth – 
REV.18.19	because in a single hour she has been destroyed!”
REV.18.20	 (Rejoice over her, O heaven, 
REV.18.20	and you saints and apostles and prophets,
REV.18.20	for God has pronounced judgment
REV.18.21	 Then
REV.18.21	“With this kind of sudden violent force
REV.18.21	Babylon the great city will be thrown down
REV.18.21	and it will never be found again!
REV.18.22	 And the sound of the harpists, musicians, 
REV.18.22	flute players, and trumpeters 
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you
REV.18.22	No
REV.18.22	will ever be found in you again;
REV.18.22	the noise of a mill
REV.18.23	 Even the light from a lamp
REV.18.23	will never shine in you again!
REV.18.23	The voices of the bridegroom and his bride 
REV.18.23	will never be heard in you again. 
REV.18.23	For your merchants were the tycoons of the world,
REV.18.23	because all the nations
REV.18.24	 The
REV.18.24	along with the blood
REV.19.1	 After these things I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a vast throng in heaven, saying,
REV.19.1	“Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, 
REV.19.2	 because his judgments are true and just.
REV.19.2	For he has judged
REV.19.2	who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality,
REV.19.2	and has avenged the blood of his servants
REV.19.3	 Then
REV.19.4	 The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures threw themselves to the ground
REV.19.5	 Then
REV.19.5	“Praise our God
REV.19.5	all you his servants,
REV.19.5	and all you who fear Him,
REV.19.5	both the small and the great!”
REV.19.6	 Then
REV.19.6	“Hallelujah! 
REV.19.6	For the Lord our God,
REV.19.7	 Let us rejoice
REV.19.7	and give him glory,
REV.19.7	because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come,
REV.19.7	and his bride has made herself ready.
REV.19.8	 She was permitted to be dressed in bright, clean, fine linen”
REV.19.9	 Then
REV.19.10	 So
REV.19.11	 Then
REV.19.12	 His eyes are like a fiery
REV.19.13	 He is dressed in clothing dipped
REV.19.14	 The
REV.19.15	 From his mouth extends a sharp sword, so that with it he can strike the nations.
REV.19.16	 He has a name written on his clothing and on his thigh: “King of kings and Lord of lords.”
REV.19.17	 Then
REV.19.17	“Come, gather around for the great banquet
REV.19.18	 to eat
REV.19.18	the flesh of generals,
REV.19.18	the flesh of powerful people, 
REV.19.18	the flesh of horses and those who ride them, 
REV.19.18	and the flesh of all people, both free and slave,
REV.19.18	and small and great!”
REV.19.19	 Then
REV.19.20	 Now
REV.19.21	 The
REV.20.1	 Then
REV.20.2	 He
REV.20.3	 The angel
REV.20.4	 Then
REV.20.5	 (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished.)
REV.20.6	 Blessed and holy is the one who takes part
REV.20.7	 Now
REV.20.8	 and will go out to deceive
REV.20.9	 They
REV.20.10	 And the devil who deceived
REV.20.11	 Then
REV.20.12	 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne. Then
REV.20.13	 The
REV.20.14	 Then
REV.20.15	 If
REV.21.1	 Then
REV.21.2	 And I saw the holy city – the new Jerusalem – descending out of heaven from God, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband. 
REV.21.3	 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: “Look! The residence
REV.21.4	 He
REV.21.5	 And the one seated on the throne said: “Look! I am making all things new!” Then
REV.21.6	 He also said to me, “It is done!
REV.21.7	 The one who conquers
REV.21.8	 But to the cowards, unbelievers, detestable persons, murderers, the sexually immoral, and those who practice magic spells,
REV.21.9	 Then
REV.21.10	 So
REV.21.11	 The city possesses
REV.21.12	 It has
REV.21.13	 There are
REV.21.14	 The
REV.21.15	 The angel
REV.21.16	 Now
REV.21.17	 He also measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits
REV.21.18	 The city’s
REV.21.19	 The foundations of the city’s wall are decorated
REV.21.20	 the fifth onyx,
REV.21.21	 And the twelve gates are twelve pearls – each one of the gates is made from just one pearl! The
REV.21.22	 Now
REV.21.23	 The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because the glory of God lights it up, and its lamp is the Lamb. 
REV.21.24	 The nations
REV.21.25	 Its gates will never be closed during the day
REV.21.26	 They will bring the grandeur and the wealth
REV.21.27	 but
REV.22.1	 Then
REV.22.2	 flowing down the middle of the city’s
REV.22.3	 And there will no longer be any curse,
REV.22.4	 and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. 
REV.22.5	 Night will be no more, and they will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will shine on them, and they will reign forever and ever.
REV.22.6	 Then
REV.22.7	 (Look! I am coming soon!
REV.22.7	Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy expressed in this book.)
REV.22.8	 I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things,
REV.22.9	 But
REV.22.10	 Then
REV.22.11	 The evildoer must continue to do evil,
REV.22.12	 (Look! I am coming soon, 
REV.22.12	and my reward is with me to pay
REV.22.13	 I am the Alpha and the Omega, 
REV.22.13	the first and the last, 
REV.22.13	the beginning and the end!)
REV.22.14	 Blessed are those who wash their robes so they can have access
REV.22.15	 Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers
REV.22.16	 “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star!”
REV.22.17	 And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say: “Come!” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wants it take the water of life free of charge.
REV.22.18	 I testify to the one who hears the words of the prophecy contained in this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described
REV.22.19	 And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life
REV.22.20	 The one who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon!” Amen! Come, Lord Jesus! 
REV.22.21	 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all.
